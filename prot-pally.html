<blockquote><font size="4"><u>1a. Getting rid of Crushing Blows and Critical Hits</u></font><br>
<br>
To get rid of Crushing Blows you need a total combined miss/dodge/parry/block of 97.4% as shown on the character screen. Holy Shield will normally provide 30% block for this purpose, <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29388" target="_blank">[Libram of Repentance]</a> will add another 5.3% block to Holy Shield. Which in turn means you need either 67.4% miss/dodge/parry/block without the Libram, or 62.1% with the Libram. (Again, these are as shown on the character screen, there is an additional 5% base miss rate which is not shown on the character screen, which covers the difference)<br>
<br>
Here are stats in order of contribution from fastest to slowest to bringing you toward making you uncrushable, posted with each stats equivalence to 1% uncrushability.<br>
<br>
7.9 Block Rating = 1% Block<br>
15 Defense Rating = 6.25 Defense Skill = 0.25% Miss, 0.25% Dodge, 0.25% Parry, 0.25% Block (Note: Defense Skill only counts if it's a whole number, so an actual 6.25 defense skill is impossible)<br>
18.9 Dodge Rating = 1% Dodge<br>
22.4 Parry Rating = 1% Parry<br>
22.7 Agility = 1% Dodge (This is with Blessing of Kings, without it you need 25 Agility instead)<br>
<br>
This macro can be useful if you want a quick in-game summary of how close you are to being uncrushable:<br>

</div>Keep in mind when gearing up however that crushing blows are (for the most part) only an issue of mobs of level 73 and bosses. If you feel you will never tank either of those, being uncrushable is a non-issue.<br>
<br>
If you are incapable of getting crushing blows while Holy Shield is up, you are also incapable of getting crit. However, you will always be uncrittable if you have 490 defense. Generally speaking resilience is more inefficient for getting rid of crits as a Paladin, while it does provide you with crit immunity faster than defense does, defense has the benefit of providing avoidance as well. Defense is also available very widely on the tanking gear you'll most likely be picking up. Having a few pieces of gear with resilience lying around can be very handy for resist fights however.<br>
<br>
This image is a graphical example of how pushing off crushing blows works:<br>
<br>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080405144601im_/http://xs120.xs.to/xs120/07431/hittable.gif" border="0" alt=""><br>
<font size="1">There is a slight inaccuracy here in the text below the first hit table illustration, the "and crush" part should not have been included.</font><br>
<br>
If you are fighting mobs lower than level 73 you also don't need a full 490 defense, 485 covers level 72 mobs, 480 covers level 71 mobs, and 475 covers level 70 mobs.<br>
<br>
In fights in which you deal with elemental based melee damage (Like Hydross) you are incapable of blocking, but mobs in these kind of fights are also incapable of crushing.<br>
<br>
<font size="4"><u>1b. (Spell) Damage and it's effect on threat</u></font><br>
<br>
Outside of the damage produced by auto-attacking, all abilities you'll use while tanking as a Paladin are affected by spell damage. Righteous Fury applies a 90% increase to the threat caused by all your holy damage.<br>
<br>
A rough approximation of how much the most used abilities benefit per point of spell damage when it comes to threat:<br>
<br>
Seal of Righteousness - 0.3 threat per hit (0.16 threat per second; this is with a 1.8 speed weapon, the scaling for Seal of Righteousness is consistent in it's threat per second through all weapon speeds)<br>
Judgement of Righteousness - 1.4 threat per hit (0.14 threat per second)<br>
Seal of Vengeance - 0.32 threat per tick (0.11 threat per second)<br>
Judgement of Vengeance/Blood - 0.81 threat per hit (0.08 threat per second)<br>
Consecration - 1.9 threat per cast (0.24 threat per second)<br>
Exorcism - 0.81 threat per hit (0.05 threat per second)<br>
Holy Wrath - 0.36 threat per hit (0.003 threat per second)<br>
Hammer of Wrath - 0.81 threat per hit (0.16 threat per second)<br>
Holy Shield - 0.12 threat per block (0.03 threat per second, if we assume 3 blocks in a 10 second period)<br>
Avenger's Shield - 0.26 threat per hit (0.008 threat per second)<br>
Holy Shock - 0.81 threat per hit (0.05 threat per second)<br>
<font size="1">All values are without any talents outside of Improved Righteous Fury. The Seal of Vengeance number is when fully stacked. Judgement of Vengeance and Blood both increase with spell damage at the same rate. Seal of Blood is not mentioned because it does not scale with spell damage. Keep in mind that these threat per second values are also when you recast the spell exactly on the cooldown, this is unrealistic for spells like Hammer of Wrath.</font><br>
<br>
Note that all above values are the speed at which they scale, the actual base strength of each of the abilities varies greatly. For example, while Seal and Judgement of Righteousness scale far better with spell damage, the base damage values of Seal and Judgement of Vengeance are a lot higher. Holy Shield also appears weak on a scaling perspective, but starts off already producing high amount of threat compared to most skills when you have no spell damage whatsoever.<br>
<br>
This means that each point of spell damage will provide you with approximately 0.5 threat per second. Obviously the benefit is higher in situations in which Exorcism, Avenger's Shield and Hammer of Wrath are usable.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind as well that your threat directly scales up, any percentage damage increase effects will also increase the threat you put out by an equal amount. So a Shadow Priest in the raid will increase your threat output by 5%, and Avenging Wrath increases your threat output by 30% for it's duration. A Discipline Priest casting Power Infusion also serves as a very good boost to your threat.<br>
<br>
Incoming damage also influences your threat in it's way; Spiritual Attunement also generates some threat for you. The threat contribution from this is approximately 5% of the damage you take, though it's important to keep in mind that Spiritual Attunement only generates mana (and thus threat) if your mana isn't full. Spiritual Attunement on a single target is still easily responsible for 50 threat per second, and most likely more. Note however that it's aggro works like healing aggro, it gets split between multiple targets if there are multiple targets that are aware of you.<br>
<br>
One final thing of note is that casting a Seal in and of itself also generates some threat. Casting a max rank Seal of Righteousness is approximately 120 threat, other seals most likely produce a comparable amount.<br>

<br>
<font size="4"><u>1c. Hit, Spellhit and Expertise and what they do for you</u></font><br>
<ul><li>Hit affects auto-attack, Seal of Blood, Avenger's Shield, Hammer of Wrath and Righteous Defense. It takes a bit less than 9% hit to be hit capped, the exception is Righteous Defense, while it uses melee hit to reduce it's chance to be resisted, it has the resist rate a spell does, so you'd need 16% hit to cap it against level 73's and bosses.</li>
<li>Spellhit affects Seal of Vengeance, all damage dealing Judgements except Judgement of Blood, Consecration, Holy Shield, Exorcism, Holy Wrath, Retribution Aura, Blessing of Sanctuary, Thorns and Fire Shield. Of note here is that Consecration can only have it's first tick fully resisted, and that Holy Shield resists are misattributed by WoW; these are actually treated as the mob whose attack you just blocked having a resisted Holy Shield on you, instead of the other way around. It takes 16% spellhit to be hit capped against level 73 targets and bosses, or 6% spellhit against level 72 targets (And 1% less needed per level below that).</li>
<li>Expertise affects auto-attack and Seal of Blood. I'm unsure of the exact "cap" on expertise, though some quick WWS browsing seems to indicate an approximately 6% dodge rate and 12% parry rate on bosses.</li>
<li>Seal of Righteousness and Judgement of Blood are special in that they're incapable of either missing or fully resisting; if your auto-attack hits your Seal of Righteousness will hit as well, and if you cast Judgement of Blood it'll always land.</li>
</ul><br>
Is either stat worth gearing for? I'd say situationally yes. Spellhit is alas quite rare outside of spell damage weaponry, though having a few high stamina rings with some spellhit around (Like for example <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29172" target="_blank">[Ashyen's Gift]</a>) can be useful in fights in which you want to be as certain as possible that most of your threat moves connect. Normal hit is less valuable in this role, though in a situation in which you need to quickly grab two or three adds (Like at Al'ar or Shade of Akama) normal hit can be valuable to increase the performance of Avenger's Shield and Righteous Defense. It's currently hard to say how good (or bad) expertise is; it's the best from a sustained TPS perspective despite only increasing your auto-attack and Seal threat due to it's lower cost compared to the other two ratings, and it also increases your survivability. Normal hit and spellhit will help with burst threat capabilities more though; expertise will not help you in those situations where you want to be sure your judgement or avenger's shield lands.<br>
<br>
Ratings needed for 1% hit with each different rating:<br>
15.8 hit rating = 1% hit<br>
12.6 spellhit rating = 1% spellhit<br>
7.8 expertise rating = 0.5% less dodges, 0.5% less parries<br>
<br>

</blockquote><font size="5"><u>2. Gear</u></font><br>
<blockquote><font size="4"><u>2a. Caster Weapons vs. Normal Weapons</u></font><br>
<br>
Generally speaking most Protection Paladins will prefer going for a caster weapon, due to the large threat boost from the spell damage these weapons provide. However, keeping a weapon around with better tanking stats can be useful in situations in which your threat isn't too important, but your survivability is.<br>
<br>
As said in section 1b of this post, spell damage translated to threat per second at a roughly 0.5 TPS per Spell Damage rate. The white damage gain from a normal weapon can't keep up with this. One option some Blood Elf Paladins might consider is using Seal of Blood, however it's scaling through tanking gear you'll be picking up as you head farther along isn't as good as the scaling of the rest of your abilities through picking up stronger spell damage weapons is. <br>
<br>
Seal of Blood is a competitive choice if you're just starting out tanking however, it provides approximately equal threat to Seal of Righteousness when comparing a level 70 blue "warrior tanking" weapon with a level 70 blue caster weapon.<br>
<br>
Note however that the <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32660" target="_blank">[Crystalforged Sword]</a> is one of the best weapons in regards to getting rid of crushing blows, as there are very few other weapons out there with block rating.<br>
<br>
A rough "progression" of caster weapons is the following:<br>
<br>
<a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29185" target="_blank">[Continuum Blade]</a> | <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32660" target="_blank">[Crystalforged Sword]</a> (Both are good, the Continuum Blade is better if you don't need the block)<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30832" target="_blank">[Gavel of Unearthed Secrets]</a><br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30095" target="_blank">[Fang of the Leviathan]</a><br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32963" target="_blank">[Merciless Gladiator's Gavel]</a><br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34009" target="_blank">[Hammer of Judgement]</a><br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30910" target="_blank">[Tempest of Chaos]</a><br>
<br>
(There are a few other items as well, but most of those are, in my opinion, too low on stamina)<br>
<br>
Once season 3 gear gets released the <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32450" target="_blank">[Gladiator's Gavel]</a> will become purchasable for honor, which makes it a very nice "first" tanking weapon. Season 3 is slated to start at some point after the release of patch 2.3. Patch 2.3 will also introduce the <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33283" target="_blank">[Amani Punisher]</a> which is a very good in between choice as well when upgrading from the Gavel of Unearthed Secrets.<br>
<br>
Weapon speed is largely inconsequential, and past the Gavel of Unearthed Secrets the majority of weapons you'll get are either 1.6 or 1.8 speed. An exception of weapon speed being inconsequential is Seal of Vengeance; as the ability is PPM based, it is better with a slower weapon, the Gavel of Unearthed Secrets is because of that the best weapon to use with Seal of Vengeance, as it's proccing becomes unreliable with faster weapons; because of this an Alliance Paladin might want to keep around the Gavel for bosses with predictable frequent complete aggro clears. Reckoning is also slightly better in theory with a slower weapon; however the gain from using a weapon of 2.0 speed or slower with reckoning will generally be less than the extra spell damage gained from upgrading your weapon.<br>
<br>
<font size="4"><u>2b. Paladin tanking gear vs. Random tanking gear</u></font><br>
<br>
Generally speaking the Paladin tanking gear available compares better and better to the random tanking gear available as you progress farther into WoW's content.<br>
<br>
For pre-raid gear, your best gear choices will generally be random tanking pieces, though the pieces from the Righteous set are good placeholders until you can get something better.<br>
<br>
For tier 4, the Helm and Shoulders are better than any alternative pieces. And the chest is quite good as well, the rest of your gear is best filled in with the random epics dropping in Karazhan.<br>
<br>
For tier 5, the Crystalforge and Blacksmith craftable items (in so far as available) are generally the best pieces. However, I advise using your own judgement here as well in comparing it to your existing gear.<br>
<br>
For tier 6, the paladin tanking gear is basically entirely superior; while the random pieces are typically stronger from a pure tanking point of view, I personally find the spell damage on the paladin tanking gear to be superior.<br>
<br>
The 2.3 patch will also add numerous new items for purchase for Badges of Justice, many of them better than a lot of the alternatives. These pieces focus most heavily on stamina, block rating and block value. Three of these pieces come with spell damage; the chest, boots and belt, however the tanking legs available are extremely good as well and can give you a very high amount of stamina.<br>
<br>
Shields are a trickier matter, generally speaking, this progression roughly applies to shields:<br>
<br>
<a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=27887" target="_blank">[Platinum Shield of the Valorous]</a> | <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28316" target="_blank">[Aegis of the Sunbird]</a> | <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32652" target="_blank">[Ogri'la Aegis]</a><br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29176" target="_blank">[Crest of the Sha'tar]</a><br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29266" target="_blank">[Azure-Shield of Coldarra]</a><br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28606" target="_blank">[Shield of Impenetrable Darkness]</a><br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28825" target="_blank">[Aldori Legacy Defender]</a><br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30909" target="_blank">[Antonidas's Aegis of Rapt Concentration]</a> (Mostly an upgrade due to the armor)<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30889" target="_blank">[Kaz'rogal's Hardened Heart]</a><br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32375" target="_blank">[Bulwark of Azzinoth]</a><br>
<br>
For the most part spell damage shields aren't as good for general tanking due to their low stamina; the <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34011" target="_blank">[Illidari Runeshield]</a> would be an exception, but I have not heard of it dropping for anyone. The <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32045" target="_blank">[Merciless Gladiator's Shield Wall]</a> can also be a useful option if your gear can handle a loss in defense from having a shield without it.<br>
<br>
Patch 2.3 will add the <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33326" target="_blank">[Bulwark of the Amani Empire]</a> as well, which drops in Zul'Aman, which neatly covers the gap that otherwise exists in between Gruul and Kaz'rogal shieldwise.<br>
<br>
<font size="4"><u>2c. Enchants</u></font><br>
<br>
For the most part for enchants health is king. In the absence of health, you'll usually want to go for an avoidance enchant instead. Cloaks and gloves (and minorly boots) have it a bit more complicated however.<br>
<br>
For cloaks, the choice is basically between +12 agility and +12 dodge rating. 12 dodge rating is 0.63% dodge, while +12 agility is 0.53% dodge and 26 armor (with Toughness). 12 dodge rating is actually very slightly better, but the difference is very minute. A more detailed analysis was done in Cathela's post <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080405144601/http://elitistjerks.com/487298-post1837.html" target="_blank"><i>here</i></a>. 120 armor is a possibility for your cloak enchant as well, however I think it's usually inferior in regards to an overall survivability boost than the other two, though it does offer the best "streak of hits" protection of these options.<br>
<br>
For gloves, the choice roughly comes down to whether you want extra threat or extra survivability from your gloves. For threat we have the choice between +20 spell damage, +2% threat and +15 spellhit. +20 spell damage and +2% threat are easily compared; if we go with the numbers above +20 spell damage is worth approximately 10 TPS, which means that 2% threat is a better enchant at 500 TPS and upwards; the only exception here is when you're in an AoE tanking situation and your consecration does less than 100 damage per tick, in this case +20 spell damage is the superior enchant since it benefits consecration more than the +2% threat enchant would do. <br>
The +15 spellhit enchant is harder to quantify, it will give you 1.2% spellhit, which can be very good in situations in which you want to be as certain as possible that your spells do not get resisted, but will lose out in comparison to both the spell damage and +threat enchants in a sustained tanking situation. It is probably best suited to fights in which adds periodically spawn and need to be killed fast, so you want to be certain you can grab them as fast and effectively as possible. It's also a better enchant choice in fights in which taunting off another tank is important.<br>
<br>
As for the survivability enchants, the choice there is in between +15 agility, +10 stamina or +240 armor (The latter two will be added in patch 2.3). +15 agility is 0.66% dodge and 35.75 armor (With kings), +10 stamina will be worth ~128 health with the full talents as of the 2.3 patch, while 240 armor will be 264 armor with talents. Personally I'd usually go for +15 agility of these three, but as with the cloak enchants, the armor and stamina enchants have the benefit of protecting you better from unlucky streaks of no avoidance, while the agility enchant does so the least of these three.<br>
<br>
Also of note is that when you get to the point that you are replacing your raid gear with other better raid gear, it might be an idea to keep the old set around but enchant it different from your new set. Generally I'd recommend enchanting the older set optimally for threat, while enchanting the newer set for survivability. This is because most of the time your newer set will be better survivability simply due to being higher itemlevel and thus having higher armor.<br>
<br>
<font size="4"><u>2d. Gems</u></font><br>
<br>
Gem choices are (generally) rather simple. As with most tanks, you'll most likely want to get as much stamina as you can get your hands on. So +12 stamina (or +15 stamina if you have access to epic gems) are most of the time your best choice.<br>
<br>
Socket bonuses are usually not worth considering, though a few exception items in which I find them worth it do exist; <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29070" target="_blank">[Justicar Shoulderguards]</a> being a prime example, and <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30125" target="_blank">[Crystalforge Faceguard]</a> being another good example. (Note that if you check my armory you'll notice some choices being made on my gearing despite this, I have a tendency to always nab stamina socket bonuses).<br>
<br>
In case you do want to grab the socket bonuses, Agility/Sta gems are usually the best choice for red sockets, while Defense/Sta gems are the best choices for yellow sockets. Spell damage/Stamina gems are also a viable option for red sockets, but I find upgrading threat to generally be the lowest priority.<br>
<br>
<font size="4"><u>2e. Trinkets</u></font><br>
<br>
Trinkets can be roughly divided into three categories you'll potentially be using. These are stamina trinkets, avoidance trinkets and threat trinkets. Each particular type of trinket is valuable in different situations, and there's a fairly wide selection of each type of trinket.<br>
<br>
Stamina trinkets are the simplest to value of the bunch, their primary use is always the health they provide, with any other effects on the trinket being nice but not vital, these are typically your best choice of trinket once you are crushing immune. The best two stamina trinkets are the Darkmoon Cards, while some of the easiest to get include the Commander's Badge and the Violet Badge.<br>
<br>
Avoidance trinkets are harder to value, and are generally most valuable for either the fact that they can serve as an "Oh damn, I temporarily need to take a good deal less damage" trinket, or for helping push off crushing blows, or if it's a trinket with defense for keeping crit immunity while wearing resist gear. Recognizing the situations in which an avoidance trinket is best, and when to use them is an acquired yet important skill. Some examples include Holy Shield going down while silenced at Gruul if you're maintanking him, or Prince Malchezaar's Sunder Armor in phase 2 stacking dangerously high; or for that matter having to move Prince Malchezaar for a large distance due to infernals.<br>
<br>
Threat trinkets tend to be best used in off-tanking situations, though they can be situationally useful in case you're tanking something that needs to die first and as fast as possible to solidify your threat lead. Threat trinkets are typically trinkets that provide high amounts of spell damage on use, though the <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30447" target="_blank">[Tome of Fiery Redemption]</a> is a very good threat trinket as well, it lasts for 15 seconds and procs approximately once every 50 seconds, making it an 'effective' 87 spell damage. One thing to do with threat trinkets is to stack with as many other damage increases as possible, Avenging Wrath, as a 30% damage multiplier, only gets better as you deal more damage after all. <br>
<br>
There are a few multifunctional trinkets out there as well, in many situations these are inferior to other trinkets, but knowing when to use them makes them quite good. <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=24126" target="_blank">[Figurine - Living Ruby Serpent]</a> is a good example of a threat trinket which doubles as a stamina trinket.</blockquote><font size="5">3. Tanking advice</font><br>
<blockquote><font size="4"><u>3a. Basic guidelines</u></font><br>
<ul><li>Your most basic tanking rotation will generally be Holy Shield &gt; Consecration &gt; Judgement &gt; Holy Shield &gt; etc.; note that there is a period in which you're not really doing much after Judging, this is a good time to use any extra abilities if applicable. That includes using Avenger's Shield or Hammer of Wrath on a boss that allows for it, as well as obviously using Exorcism if your target is undead or a demon.</li>
<li>Always try to figure out a position that you can use Consecration. Not disturbing crowd control is even more important, but nine times out of ten you can find a spot where you can use Consecration without having to worry about accidentally breaking crowd control. Consecration is responsible for a very large amount of your threat, easily 25% or thereabouts, so dropping it is usually the least preferable option.</li>
<li>For any fight that you're expecting to last for more than 30 seconds, put up a debuff judgement. Which one entirely depends on the situation. Worried about threat? Crusader. Worried about mana? Wisdom. Want to help out healing a bit on keeping melee up against AoE damage? Light. Avenger's Shield will make up for the threat lost from not immediately judging Righteousness, and if you decide to use Crusader, you'll usually catch up on threat in less time than a single Judgement cooldown.</li>
<li>Remember that Holy Shield is only your highest priority in a situation in which you're capable of getting crushed, but don't underestimate the threat it produces either. Consecration is however probably your better choice as highest priority ability in any AoE situation.</li>
<li>Couple of adds that spawn close together? Use Avenger's Shield!</li>
</ul><br>
<font size="4"><u>3b. Tips and tricks</u></font><br>
<ul><li>At the start of a pull, use Consecration before the mob reaches you, and don't use Holy Shield until the mob reaches you. Then keep refreshing Consecration as it becomes available until it would start interfering with your use of Holy Shield. This can get you in a few extra ticks of consecration you would not be able to get otherwise.</li>
<li>Similar to the above, if the mob is casting a spell and you can cast both Holy Shield and Consecration before it finishes, use Consecration first, and then use Holy Shield. This will temporarily remove the ticks you'd normally lose because of not wanting to extend the time between Holy Shield dropping and refreshing it.</li>
<li>Mobs which attack slow or cast spells are also perfect targets for trying to weave in a quick Avenger's Shield or Hammer of Wrath! Remember that doing so is risky however, while casting you are incapable of blocking, dodging or parrying. Only do so if you're absolutely certain it's safe and you could use the extra threat.</li>
<li>Make clever use of your faction specific seal/judgement! Seal of Vengeance can be used to have some constantly ticking threat on a mob that's likely to run out of your range at some point due to an aggro clear, while Judgement of Blood has an advantage in that it will always hit. The qualities of both these seals can be extremely useful in the right situation.</li>
</ul><br>
<font size="4"><u>3c. Specific fights</u></font><br>
<br>
Note: I will only be covering information on the specific fight section for fights which require unusual tactics for tanking the mobs. It is assumed that in case there are mechanics which affects all types of tanks that you can figure out on your own how to deal with this. In other words, the fight specific advice will usually mostly deal with adds and how to best deal with them as Paladin.<br>
<blockquote><font size="3"><u>Morogrim Tidewalker</u></font><ul><li>The basic tactic here is to wait for the earthquake, throw three or four Holy Lights, and then switch to normally tanking the Murlocs which will most likely have reached you by this point.</li>
<li>Make sure to communicate to the healers present that as attractive as it is, fully healing up the raid from earthquake is something that's best waited with until after the Murlocs have reached you.</li>
<li>A weapon/shield/libram swapping macro is exceptionally useful here, since you'll be wanting to get initial aggro through as strong heals as possible, but will want to use tanking (or spelldamage) gear once the Murlocs have reached you. You can use /castsequence to make one of these fairly easily, here's my own one for example:<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:0px"><img src="assets/code_html.gif" border="0"></div>
	<pre class="alt2" dir="ltr" style="
		margin: 0px;
		padding: 3px;
		border: 1px inset;
		width: 694px;
		height: 66px;
		text-align: left;
		overflow: auto">/castsequence Gavel of Pure Light, Hammer of Judgement
/castsequence Triptych Shield of the Ancients, Kaz'rogal's Hardened Heart
/castsequence Libram of Absolute Truth, Libram of the Eternal Rest</pre>
</div></li>
<li>Apart from the weapon swapping it shouldn't be needed to make any other concessions to your gear.</li>
<li>If you're having issues getting graved by Morogrim a possible option is to outrange the graves, this will make the fight last a bit larger as there won't be any damage from your mages/warlocks on Morogrim while AoEing.</li>
<li>If you're having issues getting initial Murloc aggro, it's an idea to give the healers Blessing of Salvation if they don't have it. If there's still problems, having a warlock who makes a point of being on low health for you to heal up after Earthquakes is also extremely nice, Fel Armor and Blessing of Light combined on a warlock makes for far better and more reliable heals than throwing a few heals on random people in the raid.</li>
<li>At higher gear levels the more significant challenge here is not running out of mana. There's a few tricks you can use for this, like having some murlocs in your back so they're practically guaranteed to hit you. Don't be afraid to use mana potions as needed. Alternatively switch to heavier spell damage gear which isn't technically tanking gear, or switch into a few pieces of healing gear.</li>
</ul><br>
<font size="3"><u>High Astromancer Solarian</u></font><br>
<font size="1">Thanks to Bellator, Dodo and Morganim</font><br>
<ul><li>What you do here depends on how the "spotlights" where the adds come from spawn. Your best course of action is to put consecration on a spot where the adds from two "spotlights" are likely to pass through, while using Avenger's Shield on the adds from the third "spotlight" (And being ready to throw a quick Judgement of Righteousness on the fourth add from that area).</li>
<li>Unlike what you're used to from Morogrim, each of the adds here will spawn with a bit of threat on random people in your raid; estimated at around 1000 threat. Because of that it's important that as many people as possible gather up on your position because it's likely the initial consecration ticks will not be enough to have the mobs switch their targets to you.</li>
<li>Having a set of raid frames here that can tell you if someone has aggro can be quite helpful as well for a quick Righteous Defense. Also keep an eye out for any adds that run elsewhere than where you are, or which are running out of the AoE area.</li>
<li>It's likely a few of the adds will have generated some initial aggro on some of your AoEers as well; as with Morogrim, your primary focus here isn't to take all the damage the adds do, but to ensure they don't get more than one or two hits on people less capable of taking the damage.</li>
</ul><br>
<font size="3"><u>Hyjal Trash Waves</u></font><br>
<ul><li>There's a number of methods to use here, I prefer mostly aggroing the mobs through Holy Wrath as they run just through an encampments gate, which will usually lead to any mobs that aren't aggroed heavily on an NPC or another tank running to you. Frequently this'll lead to aggroing about 4 mobs on 12 mob waves, 6 mobs on 14 mob waves, and 8 mobs on the one 16 mob wave, all of which is survivable if geared well enough (This is speaking from a point of view with generally 5 tanks present, you'll end up tanking more with less tanks there, the highest I've seen from 12 mob waves is 8 mobs when we only had 3 tanks there).</li>
<li>Once you have your initial aggro, remember that Consecration is your primary move to use here; your guild should heavily consider AoEing every single trash wave in Hyjal if they have you tanking.</li>
<li>Make sure to position carefully after having used Holy Wrath, you want to be as sure as possible that all mobs are in front of you, to reduce incoming damage as much as possible.</li>
<li>Make clear to your other tanks that you should be very capable of keeping all Ghouls, Crypt Fiends and Fel Hunters occupied; but that Abominations in particular can cause some nasty damage spikes on you, due to their 2 second stun ability as you can't dodge, parry or block while stunned.</li>
<li>The Horde camp has a few waves which include only a few mobs arriving by land; generally you can tank the entire group of mobs arriving by land by yourself in these waves. The one exception is wave 4 of the Kaz'rogal waves, which has 6 Crypt Fiends and 2 Shadowy Necromancers arriving by land. The 2 Necromancers make this trash wave nasty to solo tank.</li>
<li>In the case of waves which have only Abominations, Shadowy Necromancers and Banshees, be careful with usage of Holy Wrath. You're probably better off using Avenger's Shield, or even just Exorcism and Judgement to pull mobs onto you here, as each of these mobs hit quite hard individually compared to the mobs you'd normally be tanking.</li>
<li><a class="q1" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=5634" target="_blank">[Free Action Potion]</a>s are quite useful for any Hyjal waves in which it's likely you'll grab a lot of abominations initially, as you'll be immune to their stun while the potion lasts.</li>
</ul></blockquote>More to come!<br>
<br>
<font size="4"><u>3d. Rough guidelines of what a Prot Paladin can expect to do any fight in-game</u></font><br>
<br>
<font size="3"><u>Karazhan, Gruul's Lair and Magtheridon</u></font><br>
<ul><li>Attumen the Huntsman - Tank either Midnight or Attumen; a sufficiently geared Prot Paladin can also easily tank both at the same time.</li>
<li>Moroes - Tank anything; tanking Moroes himself is preferrable as Prot Paladins aren't too strong on building off-tank threat (Especially at the expected gear level for Moroes, this gets less bad with more spell damage). However the nature of this fight is such that there is more than a significant enough of build time on Moroes before DPS starts on him.</li>
<li>Maiden of Virtue - Tank Maiden. The silence is annoying, but can be worked around by spamming your buttons.</li>
<li>Oz - Keep any add occupied and/or tank the Crone.</li>
<li>Romulo and Julianne - Preferably tank Romulo; though tanking Julianne is viable as well.</li>
<li>Big Bad Wolf - Tank.</li>
<li>Curator - Tank Curator; can also try keeping adds that spawn occupied. Make sure to save Avenging Wrath for Evocation for the nice damage/threat boost.</li>
<li>Terestrian Illhoof - Tank any of the mobs involved. Can also potentially keep imps occupied, though will take more damage doing so than an AoE class due to the lower damage dealt. Also quite viable to tank both Illhoof and Kil'rek at the same time.</li>
<li>Shade of Aran - Healing; or keeping non-CCed elementals busy during that phase of the encounter.</li>
<li>Netherspite - Tank.</li>
<li>Prince Malchezaar - Tank.</li>
<li>Nightbane - Tank adds during flying phases; if you have fear ward or a shaman good at timing Tremor Totem drops tanking Nightbane himself is viable as well. Post 2.3 tanking Nightbane will always be viable due to the fear AI change.</li>
<li>High King Maulgar - Tank Maulgar, Blindeye or Olm. Tanking Kiggler is possible as well due to ranged taunt and getting disarmed not mattering that much as long as you have capped unarmed skill.</li>
<li>Gruul - Either main tank or off-tank; off-tanking will require a good stock of <a class="q1" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32783" target="_blank">[Blue Ogre Brew]</a>, the timing of the silence is semi-random and may result in being left open to crushing blows from time to time.</li>
<li>Magtheridon - Tank adds and/or Magtheridon.</li>
</ul><br>
<font size="3"><u>Zul'aman</u></font><br>
<ul><li>Nalorakk - Works well as tank in either human or bear form. Ardent Defender works well with the DoT damage done in bear form, though the silence is annoying.</li>
<li>Akil'zon - Most likely depends on raid setup whether you'll tank or heal. Tanking is definitely viable. Doing the gauntlet on the way to this boss is also possible as only tank; just tell people to stand on top of you and you'll generally get all mobs on you.</li>
<li>Jan'alai - Tank the Dragonhawk hatchlings. If you have some FR gear it helps. You can easily hold aggro on an entire platform's worth of hatchlings at once (And in full FR gear can go for hatching both platforms in a single Hatcher spawn; though ensure that one hatcher is still killed anyway). I recommend the following ability use: Use Judgement of Righteousness on the first Hatchling that spawns, use Avenger's Shield on the next two, use Judgement of Righteousness on one of the next four, and use Righteous Defense to taunt the other three (Who should all be going for the same healer). After this healing aggro gets divided amongst enough targets for Consecration to be enough to grab all Hatchlings that spawn.</li>
<li>Halazzi - Tank anything involved in the encounter. It's also possible to tank both Halazzi and the Lynx add that spawns at the same time, but there's little reason to do so as you need a second tank to soak Saber Lash anyway.</li>
<li>Hex Lord Malacrass - Tank anything in the encounter. If you're tanking Malacrass himself, I'd recommend keeping up Judgement of Light on him; this will provide reasonable amount of healing from the damage Spirit Bolts do on the melee.</li>
<li>Zul'jin - Tank; however your raid might be more comfortable with the other tank you have along tanking Zul'jin so you have extra healing available. One thing to keep in mind is that Zul'jin's aggro does not reset aggro until after he actually changes into a new form; do not blow your abilities too early.</li>
</ul><br>
<font size="3"><u>Serpentshrine Cavern and The Eye</u></font><br>
<ul><li>Hydross the Unstable - Tank adds or Hydross himself. Will require <a class="q1" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=3823" target="_blank">[Lesser Invisibility Potion]</a> to safely pull Hydross if frost tank. With sufficient mixed resist gear tanking all adds at once is viable; if you are one of Hydross's tanks, tanking some adds of your equipped resistance as well as Hydross is viable too. Keep in mind that Holy Shield does nothing here, you can't block elemental based melee damage.</li>
<li>The Lurker Below - Tanks adds and/or Lurker. Best to position so you're swimming in the water; remember that you don't have Feral Charge or Intercept to quickly get back in case of a whirl + geyser combo. With recent changes to Consecration range it might be possible to tank Lurker and hit him with Consecration now while standing on the ed ge of the platform; we haven't run SSC since then, so I can't test this myself.</li>
<li>Morogrim Tidewalker - Tank the Murlocs. Unless there are two Prot Paladins this should always be the preferred role. See the fight-specific advice above for more details.</li>
<li>Fathom-Lord Karathress - Tank the Hunter add, (and) his pet, or Karathress. Tanking other mobs is possible, but Feral Druids are better at taking the burst from the Shaman, while Warriors can help interrupt the heals from the Priest.</li>
<li>Leotheras the Blind - Tank Leo during human phases. Alliance Paladins in particular will find Seal of Vengeance to be potentially quite useful here. Tanking the demon is possible as well, but a Prot Paladin is probably not the strongest class for this, though a few people have reported great success tanking the demon as Prot Paladin (The biggest issue I'd see being that you might run into mana issues if you're particularly lucky with resists).</li>
<li>Lady Vashj - Tank Vashj, tank Nagas during phase 2.</li>
<li>Al'ar - Tanks adds or Al'ar; in phase 2 of the fight Avenger's Shield is extremely good for grabbing the adds that spawn after each meteor.</li>
<li>Void Reaver - Tank; it's helpful if your Prot Paladin can pull here. With sufficient spell damage gear for it, it's possible for a Prot Paladin to keep aggro for the vast majority of the fight.</li>
<li>High Astromancer Solarian - Tank the Solarium Agents. See the above section for more details.</li>
<li>Kael'thas Sunstrider - Tank two to three weapons in phase two, tank Master Engineer Telonicus, tank Phoenixes in phase four and five. Tanking Kael'thas himself is also possible, but will make getting Shock Barriers down before a second Pyroblast more important due to less different abilities to deal with the damage than a warrior.</li>
</ul><br>
<font size="3"><u>Mount Hyjal and Black Temple</u></font><br>
<ul><li>Hyjal in general - Perfect tank during trash waves. See advice above for more details.</li>
<li>Rage Winterchill - Tank or heal; depending on raid composition.</li>
<li>Anetheron - Good Infernal tank with proper FR gear. Exorcism and Avenger's Shield make for easily grabbing the Infernals as long as people make at least some effort to move towards your tanking spot. Anetheron tanking just as viable, but not as much of an advantage over other tanks.</li>
<li>Kaz'rogal - Probably best off healing; though damage taken is most likely high enough to prevent running out of mana.</li>
<li>Azgalor - Doomguard tank or healing; silence is very frequent and annoying and will cost you a good amount of threat on Azgalor himself.</li>
<li>Archimonde - Healing; ability to not get feared here is too important due to the inability to dodge/parry/block while feared.</li>
<li>High Warlord Naj'entus - Tanking Naj'entus. Note that that this fight rewards bringing a lot of healing, so might be better to heal here.</li>
<li>Supremus - Main tank Supremus or help soak Hateful Strikes.</li>
<li>Shade of Akama - Tank the Ashtongue Rogues, Spiritbinders and Elementalists; Avenger's Shield is very good here. There is a bug with the Ashtongue Defenders which makes them ignore some of the Prot Paladin abilities.</li>
<li>Teron Gorefiend - Tank Teron. However, due to the nature of the encounter potentially better off healing; tanking Teron himself is much like any other fight, but more healers is a good counter to being unlucky with healers constantly being picked for Shadow of Death.</li>
<li>Gurtogg Bloodboil - Tank Gurtogg. As with Naj'entus, taking more healers is heavily rewarded here, so you might be preferred to help healing. Getting Fel Rage as Prot Paladin is fun though. Also remember that you can't generate threat during Fel Rage phases, so these are a perfect time to use Seal of Wisdom instead.</li>
<li>Reliquary of Souls - Heal or tank. No gear switching possible in between phases, and mechanics make warriors required tanks for the second phase. The second phase requires spell reflect unless your guild heavily outgears the encounter. Paladins are the only tanks whose threat scales up with the aura in phase three, and despite not having too good a way to dump mana, the Soul Scream does a lot lower damage per mana than it does damage per rage.</li>
<li>Mother Shahraz - Heal or serve as Saber Lash soak. Maintanking not viable due to frequent silence around Mother Shahraz. Keeping up a Judgement while otherwise not attacking is recommended while off-tanking, and you can usually throw one or two heals after each Saber Lash.</li>
<li>Illidari Council - Tank Veras Darkshadow or Lady Malande. Gathios the Shatterer is better tanked by a Warrior due to Spell Reflect usability. Lady Malande can also favor a warrior due to need to interrupt, but should still be viably tankable as Paladin.</li>
<li>Illidan Stormrage - Can tank anything here. Note that you will need 67.4% combined dodge/parry/block before Holy Shield to avoid Shear if you tank Illidan. This is different from crushing blows because you can not count on being missed. Flames of Azzinoth tanking is same as for any other tank, though due to incapability of blocking elemental based melee attacks it might be better to tank the second Flame to be DPSed, threat is slightly helped by the fact that the Flames count as Demons, making Exorcism usable however, and it is certainly possible to be the tank on the first flame; however a good druid or warrior will most likely produce better threat.</li>

		<div id="post_message_510929"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->You might want to mention +8 stamina as a hand enchant option, via leatherworking.  Also, +armor to cloak is an option.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure the full legwork has actually been done on this, but given that some of our new itemization has +spell hit on it it may be a decent time to do a full rundown on the effect of +hit, +expertise, and +spell hit on our threat.<br>
<br>
The abilities to which these each contribute:<br>
<br>
+expertise affects melee damage, SoR damage, and contributes to preventing parry haste from mobs.<br>
<br>
+hit affects melee damage, SoR damage, and Avenger's Shield.<br>
<br>
+spell hit affects JoR and Righteous Defense primarily, but also contributes slightly to threat from Consecration, BoSanctuary, Holy Shield, and other damage shields such as Retribution Aura and Thorns.<br>
<br>
It's a little bit annoying that we need so many +hit stats to max our threat, but I guess we can just throw more +spell damage at the problem and get it done that way-- although with less consistency than our +hit/+expertise maxed warrior cousins on most of the main threat abilities.  (Tclap, Demo, and Taunt for them are on spell hit.)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
I'd also like to add that Spell Hit helps those people who use Seal of Vengeance while tanking, since the proc can be resisted.  It's not 100% confirmed either, but apparently Precision will affect spells in 2.3, so keep that in mind as well.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

You may want to add a little about the announced ZA/Heroic badge tanking loot as it's looking really really nice. Items with high amounts of Stam,  +dmg but not wasting itemization on Int (unlike Lightbringer) and gear which doesnt give massive avoidance levels (thus negating threat from blocks) but giving very high levels of shield block value. I would go as far to say the heroic/ZA loot is close to being as good as BT tanking loot due to the much better itemisation.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Seal of Vengeance is approximately 20 PPM.  The proc can only trigger on a successful melee hit, and the proc can be resisted seperately.  It stacks up to five times - refreshing the duration every proc - each stack does a base of 30 damage per tick, and each stack gets (roughly) a 4% spell damage coefficient per tick.  It ticks once every 3 seconds.  So that 5 stacks maximum, each stack gets 5 ticks, 4% per tick means a 100% coefficient over the 15 seconds at a full stack.  I verified these numbers on Live just now.<br>
<br>
When you have five stacks on the target, procs will instantly deal 2% of your spell damage to the target.<br>
<br>
The Judgement deals 120 damage per stack currently on the target, and receives a normal 42.86% coefficient for an instant attack, regardless of how many stacks are present.<br>
<br>
Much like how you can stack up absurdly high rolling Lifeblooms with trinkets and Power Infusion, you can get absurdly high Seal of Vengeance stacks by having damage trinkets, Avenging Wrath, or Power Infusion present when you apply the first stack of Holy Vengeance.  So if you had an Icon of the Silver Crescent on my gear (493 spell damage, plus 16 from Improved Divine Spirit, plus 80 from a Holy flask, plus 23 from food, plus 40 from weapon oil; 850 total with the trinket up), with Power Infusion and Avenging Wrath up when I applied my first stack, it would tick for 436 every 3 seconds (276 TPS).<br>
<br>
The big weakness of Seal of Vengeance, however, is its inconsistency due to its proc-based nature, which is further compounded by how fast tanking weapons tend to be.Assume you're using a Gladiator's Gavel at 1.6 speed, so the proc rate is ~ 0.533% per hit, you are missed, dodged, or parried about 15% of the time, and the proc resists 17% of the time.  That means any given swing only has a 37.6% chance to proc Seal of Vengeance, which isn't all that hot in fights that may also contain an element of movement.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I'm not a pally by any means, however I was under the impression the highest threat from seals/judges was keeping JotC on the target, keeping SoR on yourself, and judging righteousness every opportunity.  That's probably overly simplistic, especially if you have Seal of Vengeance available, but is that a good general idea on bosses?<br>

<br>
A section on armor.  Something evaluating the relative merits of armor vs stamina.  Someone did this in the old thread; I'll try to dig it up and make it pretty.<br>
<br>
A section on fight-specific notes.  A lot of people posted in the old thread asking "I'm about to start tanking _______.  What should I do?"  I'm thinking specifically about some of the trickier fights like Hydross, Voidreaver, Al'Ar, Leo, and maybe Morogrim and even Prince.  This could have like a paragraph for each fight summarizing the gearing and tactics for the fight, and then links to the posts in the old thread where people discuss them.  I'll work on this too, unless you want to dig these up yourself.<br>

		<div id="post_message_511594"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I've added a few updates, mostly to the gear section. Currently browsing a bit through the MTanking Viability thread for an idea of which bosses to give some advice for and for other ideas in regards to thread additions.<br>
<br>
I'll probably also add a spellhit vs. hit vs. expertise section after some analysis of each stat and the benefit it brings to each of our abilities.<br>
<br>
I'm also contemplating adding a bit more detail to the gearing section in regards to what kind of tanking to try and gear for. Currently what kind of tanking you gear for is largely decided simply by what tier of content you are at though, but the new loot introduced in 2.3 really does bring a bit more choice in regards to whether you want to simply maximize stamina and armor, whether you want high block values, or whether you want high avoidance.<br>
<br>
Edit:<br>
<br>
Browsing through the thread a few tips on how to avoid having to drink up to full after every single pull in a 5-man seems a good addition as well.<br>
<br>
In addition to giving advice giving some rough guidelines on health levels to expect while uncrushable at varying levels of gear could be good additions too, as would levels of spell damage at various gearing levels.<br>
<br>
I should probably also look into quantifying the exact spell damage per TPS number better. The current 0.5 I use is very, very rough; it was based on untalented spells (outside of Righteous Fury) but also no resists, figuring those two would balance out, but I doubt they really do in practice, so the number might be either higher or lower.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>That's a good idea, thanks.<br>
<br>
I've also been fudging around a bit with a talent calculator to get a good idea of which talents are likely to need a comparison to each other, as well as potentially suggest a few builds for the next patch. Doing so actually gave me a few good insights on my own spec for the next patch as well, the sacrifice I'm going to have to make for it isn't as large as I'd anticipated, though keeping those 20 points in holy does get tricky with Tier 7 of our talent tree containing 8 points of good talents, tier 8 containing 5 points of good talents, and tier 9 obviously being good for being Avenger's Shield. I'll most likely write up a section on talent decisions with a few suggested specs tomorrow.<br>
<br>
I'll probably also add some advice on Al'ar, Kael and Shade of Akama soon; and possibly a short section on what kind of gearing you need to tank Illidan, despite not having personal experience with this the information posted over on the MTanking Viability thread by Teckbot covers all I need to know to write some tips. Then again, I'd guess that if you're a Paladin tanking Illidan you'll be unlikely to need any tips. Ah well, who knows.<br>
<br>

</div>Along those lines, a section with a prot-pally's role in every fight might not be the worst thing ever.  My guild's on Vashj, and (hopefully) soon on Kael, and I know coming up through SSC I was often questioned by my guild leader as to what I would be capable/good at doing.  Doesn't have to be complicated, expect on those fights where we really kick ass  (the ones you mentioned).  But a list to be able to show a GL or RL to justify your spot on the fight/raid would be handy.  I know the old thread was Paladin Main Tanking, but I'd imagine there are a fair amount of paladins out there who are more in an OT position like myself.<br>
<br>
HKM - Tank High King, priest or warlock.<br>
Gruul - Tank or heal.  If you're sadistic/have a million spare mana pots OT.  Make sure and time Holy Shield for Reverbs.<br>
Mag - Channeler or Mag.<br>
Hydross - Hydross or add(s).  Can tank multiple adds easier with a very good resist set (&gt;250 each buffed).<br>
Lurker - Submerged inner ring adds or Lurker<br>
TW - explained above<br>
FLK - Pet is easiest, followed by Hunter, then priest if you have help on interrupts, then FLK/shammy (from what I've read it's a toss-up, personally haven't done either).<br>
Leo - Channeler/ Leo.  Arguably better than a warrior as it's easy to kill inner demon in full tank gear.<br>
Vashj - Vashj/Naga tank.  Don't need more than 2 tanks here.<br>
Al'ar - Awesome add tank, can tank Al'ar too<br>
VR - MT (i.e. pull), heal or if sadistic/have a million spare mana pots can OT.<br>
Solarian - Trash alone justifies a prot pally, useful for gathering AoE adds during the fight.<br>
<br>
And that's all I've seen.  I'd love to have a list like that for KT/BT/Hyjal though.  Much easier than reading through those 50+ page threads on each fight( or the ungodly long pally MT thread) to figure out what I might be useful at.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Per the character screen, I have 286 Defense Rating, giving me +120 Defense Skill (286 * 150 / 355 = 120.8, round down), for a total of 490 Defense Skill ( adding  that 120 to 350 base + 20 talent).<br>

The function <i>GetCombatRating(CR_DEFENSE_SKILL)</i> returns <b><i>Defense Skill</i></b> (120.91054534912 for me), not <b><i>Defense Rating</i></b>.  There's no need to multiply it by 150 / 355, from what I can see.<br>

<br>
As for Denogran, while I understand what you're talking about, in general a lot of fights in Hyjal/BT are basically capable of being handled by any kind of tank. There are a few exceptions here and there (E.G. Paladins might make a better infernal tank at Anetheron due to superior ranged aggro capabilities, and the mechanics of the Reliquary of Souls fight makes Paladin tanking on it unwise unless your guild severely outgears the encounter). Generally speaking it can be covered by the fact that "If it's multiple adds that spawn that need to be aggroed solidly fast, you're the best choice for it". I'll still add a section for it if though, but a lot of bosses can actually be summarized as "Do whatever your guild needs you for most in this fight".<br>
<br>
Edit:<br>
<br>
Any updates I'll be making will be held off until the weekend. I have a busy time today and tomorrow.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>FWIW, our OT whenever we do Gruul is a Paladin.  (Our MT is a druid...yes we do things backwards.)  He never complains about mana issues, but he might be chugging Ogri'la pots.  Last night with a shadow priest in his group and JoW up on Gruul, he used one mana pot.  He does not usually have a shadow priest, I believe, but JoW is often up on Gruul.<br>
<br>
He has ~13.5k HP unbuffed.  We have Gruul on farm and are making forays into Mag's lair and SSC.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">FWIW, our OT whenever we do Gruul is a Paladin.  (Our MT is a druid...yes we do things backwards.)  He never complains about mana issues, but he might be chugging Ogri'la pots.  Last night with a shadow priest in his group and JoW up on Gruul, he used one mana pot.  He does not usually have a shadow priest, I believe, but JoW is often up on Gruul.<br>
<br>
He has ~13.5k HP unbuffed.  We have Gruul on farm and are making forays into Mag's lair and SSC.</div>

</div>Sure, your mileage may vary.  I was stating what I've seen, and to this point the dps has basically outgeared me, meaning I really have to work my ass off to stay ahead of them.  On a fight like Gruul, I'd rather heal or "DPS" than worry about the tanking.<br>
<br>
As for the list, I know that not all fights will have a distinction.  But I'd love for this thread to be somewhere I could point my guild leader and raid leader and be like, "There, that's how prot paladins work.  Those are fights we kick-ass on.  Those are the fights where we'll struggle on."  Where I'm at now, my guild finally trusts me as a *tank," and I don't forsee much trouble going forward.  But I've definitely had tells in the past along the lines of "I'm not sure how protection paladins work, and what your role would be for this fight, so I need to sit you."<br>
<br>
Most writeups, videos, etc of boss kills don't have paladins tanking.  Most of the threads in these forums start out with several pages of strategies without paladin tanks, because the people doing the first kills pretty much didn't use us.  So when my Raid Leader reads a strat, they aren't necessarily looking for how to best use a tankadin, but more how to kill the boss period.  So it's up to me to suggest what I should be doing, like "Hey, I can tank so-and-so in this encounter."  A quick-list of paladin tanking roles on various bosses would be invaluable for me to link to, and most likely fairly helpful to people just starting their 25-man progression as prot.<br>
<br>
If there's anything I can help with, let me know.  I've been meaning to create a Prot Pally 101 post for my own guild for some time, but haven't had the spare time, so thanks!</div>

		<div id="post_message_517361">Might also be worth stressing how important it can be to get your DPS to give you those first few seconds to get aggro before they start opening up with the AE.  DPS with an itchy trigger finger can make picking up AE packs a lot more challenging.  I know I've heard of having DPS hold off a few seconds referred to as "common sense" in other threads, but if people are going to be looking at this thread for a definitive idea of how to utilize prot pallies, it might be helpful to let them know it's important.</div>

I guess it makes sense not all of us are guild masters and/or raid leaders themselves. It should be easy enough for me to compile something like that, especially since I have experience with pretty much doing anything in tier 4 and tier 5 content, not in tier 6 content, but I have pretty broad experience there as well by now.<br>
<br>
And good point about telling people to give their pallies a chance to aggro. I'll probably cover that properly in the Hyjal section since it matters a lot there.</div>

		<div id="post_message_517990">hey folks, apologies if this isn't the correct thread to ask such a question but I have a request for some theorycrafting for a protection paladin.<br>
<br>
Firstly, this is regarding the changes to some of the talents in patch 2.3. These talents are Vindication, Persuit of Justice and Seal of Command. I've been experimenting with the talent calculator on WoWhead and found that by losing 1 handed weapon specialisation, I have the following choices;<br>
<br>
3/3 Vindication and 2/3 Persuit of Justice, or 3/3 Vindication and Seal of Command with 1 talent point spare to put in something else.<br>
<br>
So the question is, How effective is vindication when tanking things like trash mobs in raids? I'm aware most bosses are immune to the effect. Also, is a -2 or 3% chance to be hit by a spell going to make much of a difference when tanking spell casting mobs? and, if the benefits are substantial in any way, is the loss of the 5% damage from 1 handed weapon specialization still too much of a loss to justify taking those talents.<br>
<br>
Also in regards to seal of command, my thinking was getting a slow 1 hander and using the seal for something like offtanking might be a better choice then tanking with seal of righteousness or vengeance. The randomness of seal of 'casino' makes me unsure however.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry if this question has already been covered but I couldn't find any information on it.</div>

		<div id="post_message_518004">Observation of Vindication on PTR:   <br>
<br>
Using pitbull to see the exact mana values, Vindicaiton reduced caster mob mana from 3231 to 2916.  <br>
<br>
That's a difference of 315 mana points, or around 10~%.   <br>
<br>
<br>
Not knowing mob health values, I couldn't really test how much it reduced their HP, but I was able to test if it had any effect.  <br>
<br>
I attacked a self-healing mob (treants in NE part of Auchindon crater), applied Vindication, allowed the treant to heal to full, and then watched Vindication fade.  When Vindication dropped, the mob % hp dropped from 100% to 96% (there might have been a regrowth tick in there, but I was mostly interested in seeing if it affected HP at all).   So the % Sta reduction does work, though it won't be 15% of their total HP, obviously.  <br>

In other words, Vindication does indeed affect mob stats if the debuff sticks.</div>

</div>That leads to the question - how much does stamina account for raid trash HP? and would vindication on a trash mob amount to a 4%~ HP drop on a mob with say...100k hp.<br>
<br>
Thanks for sharing the testing you've done Fiola. I'm going to use that method and check mob health drops with the use of beastlore if possible as it shows the mobs current and max health values. Should be very accurate.</div>

</div>Good call.  Might want to show something like this:<br>

<a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32652"><span><span class="bluename">[Ogri'la Aegis]</span></span></a><br>
<br>
The first is good to add since sometimes you might not get a certain drop for a long time, while the Aegis is a sure item if you get the rep and items to turn in for it.</div>

</div>EDIT: You gave me quite a scare there, but it seems like you have misunderstood the changes. When I asked around in the cesspit.. erhm... I mean on the official forums, I quickly got the reply that no, seal and judgement damage still benefits from spell damage, not attack power. According to the replies, that has not been changed. (See <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304065056/http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=1296610656&amp;postId=12959842924&amp;sid=1#3" target="_blank">this thread</a>.) I hope they are correct.<br>
<br>
<i>Original message:<br>
Eeeek?! Now I'm worried. Could someone please check or confirm if paladin judgement and seal damage scales with AP instead of spell damage on the PTR?<br>
<br>
If I have understood correctly, that would entail a significant threat generation nerf for protection paladins.<br>
<br>
Please put my troubled mind at ease by saying ain't so. Sorry if this is considered off topic, but I feel that this thread was the best place to ask.</i></div>

Just some thoughts. Great thread tho, i already found it to be very useful.</div>

		<div id="post_message_518648">Weapon Speed for Protection Paladin<br>
--------------------------------------<br>
Personally, I have found it to be a non-issue completely. Both slow and fast weapons have their pros and cons.<br>
<br>
Fast Weapon ( under 2.0 ): More consitent threat. The less time between weapon swings, the less a dodge or parry will hurt you in terms of short term threat per second. With a speed under 2.0, you will lose some of the direct benefit or reckoning, however you will gain the ability to take better advantage of repeated reckoning procs. Fast weapons also proc utility judgements such as JoW more often, as they are % based rather than PPM. A con is that you will have more parries with a faster weapon, thus take slightly more spike damage.<br>
<br>
Slow Weapon( over 2.0 ): Less consistent threat due to dodge/parry, but takes better advantage of reckonings 4 swings. The dps/threat gain of any weapon over 2.0 speed is exactly the same over time. Slower weapons also have a higher chance to proc SoV for alliance paladins choosing to use it.<br>
<br>
Speed has no effect on SoR dps, as it is normalized to the weapon speed.<br>
<br>
This topic will probably die even moreso with 2.3, as I forsee reckoning being cut from many MT builds in favor of more mitigation(CoEx)/more consistent aggro(Precision/ISotC).</div>

		<div id="post_message_518686">Looking at the OP, I find a lot of it seems to be focused on what we might call a Maintankadin. Many protection paladins often find themselves in a shared role for this and should take note of different strategies/gearing for different roles they might play. It can be very rewarding playing a prot paladin that is not maintanking (Morogrim, Al'ar come to mind first).<br>
<br>
<br>
Gearsets for a Protection Paladin<br>
-------------------------------------<br>
Main Tank Set: This set is designed for tanking the hardest hitters or progression content. Focus on maximizing stamina and armor while maintaining uncrushability. We are no different than warriors in this respect, as it has been proven that constant, low damage is far more healable than spike damage that you would gain by increasing avoidance instead of mitigation.<br>
<br>
Threat Set: This set is designed for aoe fights or fast fights where you must obtain and build aggro very fast. Look for the paladin specific gear with spell damage, and spell damage trinkets like <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28789"><span><span class="purplename">[Eye of Magtheridon]</span></span></a> and <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29370"><span><span class="purplename">[Icon of the Silver Crescent]</span></span></a>.<br>
<br>
Block Value Set: This set is designed for aoe tanking many mobs for longer durations. The idea is to reduce the mob hits to near zero. The <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29387"><span><span class="purplename">[Gnomeregan Auto-Blocker 600]</span></span></a> is great for this. 2.3 is introducing many new block value items as well. With a full block value set, a paladin will be able to block approximately 1000hp post-mitigation hits.<br>
<br>
Non-tanking Damage Set: I haven't done the numbers to be honest, someone should probably get on it. Personally I use a spell damage set (my threat trinkets and the lamellar pvp gear, some of the tier items). I know some horde use a retribution style set with SoB instead of SoR. Irregarless, turn off Righteous Fury or you will die faster than an Enhance Shaman without salvation.<br>
<br>
Healing Set: Do not take offense to being asked to heal. Some fights there just is not room for many tanks, and the best you can do for the raid is heal. This set should not be like a holy healing set, but rather focus on healing and mp5, as crit does little for a non-Illumiation build.<br>
<br>
Additionally, you will want to get a set of 20 slot bags, as on any given raid you may use all 5 of these sets. Oh, and don't forget your resist gear for Hydross. Suckers!</div>

</div>O man, so true,  I've been too cheap to buy the 20-slotters, but it's always embarrassing to tell a mage "Can you just give me 2 stacks of water? I'm out of bagspace."  I've actually not taken side-grades before because it wasn't worth it to throw something out.<br>
<br>
If you're primarily an off-tank I'd suggest concentrating first on a threat set.  In my experience, the off-tank's tend to have their target dps'd down first, so you need to be able to pump out the threat fast in order for the dps to be able to light it up.<br>
<br>
But don't neglect your high stamina, high mitigation set, low threat set either, even if you're not going to be MTing anything.  Often, if you're assigned a target that's not going to be dying for a couple of minutes (last channeler on mag, last FLK add), staying alive is the hard part, and keeping the mob on you is near trivial.  In these cases, you can pretend you're a warrior and play with items like <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30058"><span><span class="purplename">[Mallet of the Tides]</span></span></a>.</div>

Good point on the multiple alternative shields to start out with especially, thanks.<br>
<br>
As to the spell damage versus survivability choice for enchants, I'd say that's largely dependent on how well geared you are and how you feel about your aggro. I'd actually recommend if at all possible to keep some of your old gear around and enchant those optimally for spell damage, while setting your new gear to survivability (Generally I find that if you want more aggro, you generally don't mind losing the survivability, so using an older gear set is better for it). <br>
When I get around to adding a list of suggested protection padin roles for each fight in the game though, I could probably include a note on whether it's a role in which you should probably favor survivability or where you should favor threat.</div>

		<div id="post_message_520752">I was trying to come up with a holy/prot spec for end-game that will keep the healing capability of regular healing specs while still maintaining minimal offtanking capability:<br>
<a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?talent=sVEu0xzheotx0thL" target="_blank">Talent Calculator - World of Warcraft</a><br>
<br>
I got the idea for it when I read and heard about a lot of protection paladins finding themselves healing more often than tanking, but when they were tanking they were *needed* to tank. Yet nobody likes to respec several times a week especially not during 1 raid, although if you're *really really* hardcore I suppose this kind of spec is totally useless to you as you can just respec per fight.<br>
<br>
What you lose from raiding capability as a healer is imp LoH (which is kinda sad but it's the only thing I think is droppable) and the buff flexibility (buff kings only). In 2.3 (and if you specced into it beforehand) you lose some judging capability (especially the new improved judgement of the crusader). For these reasons this spec is losing a lot of viability when you have less than 3 pallies in a regular raid, so let's make it easy and say for now that it's not worth speccing into it if you're not regularly raiding with 3 pallies, as you kinda want minimum 2 paladin healers.<br>
<br>
My real question is not the ability to heal with that spec, that's pretty obvious. What I was wondering is what you'll actually be able to tank with that spec. Obviously crush immunity isn't possible so tanking bosses isn't going to happen, and you don't have the stamina/damage reduction for it anyway. I was wondering more about tanking stuff like murlocs on morogrim, elementals on hydross, hunter pet and/or hunter on karathress, adds on astromancer/al'ar, offtanking void reaver etc. I don't have experience in BT/hyjal so I didn't include any fights there but I was wondering if there are fights there where this kind of spec could swap gear and tank those fights.<br>
<br>
For tanking this spec obviously lacks damage reduction and HP buffing and maxed threat but it does have the basic armor/defense and imp righteous fury and seal of righteousness which seem to be the majority of your threat, although it's probably still a noticeable threat drop from full prot with holy shield.<br>
<br>
For non-raid content: I doubt this spec would have any difficulty MTing regular 5-mans but would it be reasonable for heroic MTing? It seems to me like at least the easier heroics should be doable with it when you can't find a tank.<br>
<br>
<b>Is this spec actually going to be of any use in raiding (of any level) or is it completely pointless and one should forget about it and just choose between tanking and healing?</b><br>
While I don't really know (which is why I made this post, to see people's replies), I would guess it would fair fine for at least 5-man/heroics MTing and kara/gruul/mag offtanking plus possibly a select few fights in SSC/TK, and if that's the case at least it would be good for fresh-70 paladins who want to catch up to the top-end-game.</div>

For non-raid content: I doubt this spec would have any difficulty MTing regular 5-mans but would it be reasonable for heroic MTing? It seems to me like at least the easier heroics should be doable with it when you can't find a tank.<br>

While I don't really know (which is why I made this post, to see people's replies), I would guess it would fair fine for at least 5-man/heroics MTing and kara/gruul/mag offtanking plus possibly a select few fights in SSC/TK, and if that's the case at least it would be good for fresh-70 paladins who want to catch up to the top-end-game.</div>

</div>A lot of the avoidance for a protection paladin comes later in the tree with Holy Shield and Ardent Defender so losing those if you are hoping to off tank seriously would put a pretty big dent in your mitigation which should be your first and foremost port of call if you are even considering being a tank of any kind.<br>
<br>
Your spec is very holy heavy so it probably would be great for threat generation but in some of the heroics where the mobs tend to hit a bit harder (Slavepens and Mechanar spring to mind) you might find your healers getting slightly flustered at times unless you all severely out gear the content.<br>
<br>
At present something like:<br>
<a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?talent=sVxhbxZVMtIh0dMgqz" target="_blank">Talent Calculator - World of Warcraft</a><br>
would be fine for doing both, of course you lose some efficiency (through extra crit on HL / FoL) and bonus healing due to missing out on the higher tier holy talents but provided your healing gear is up to standard the efficiency should still be adequate for healing in raids and heroics provided you have good control of your healing.<br>
<br>
You will lose the 10% stam from WE in 2.3 but if you are just off tanking then that build (and assuming you have decent gear) should be fine without the extra stamina due to the things you will be tanking.</div>

</div>This spec is a fine holy spec, but you're really going to feel fairly gimped while tanking, unless your tanking gear is _awesome_.  You're losing out on significant health (sacred duty, ardent defender), significant threat generation (reckoning, one-hand spec, holy shield), and a lot of avoidance (precision[ret tree], holy shield, shield spec).  Depending on your dps/healing, you could be ok, but they'd have to play pretty nicely with you.  Without holy shield, you're going to get hit unmitigated a lot, and without sacred duty you're going to have a lot less health available to drop.<br>
<br>
It's a good spec if you're guild needs a healer, and then someone who can occasionally take a coupla blows.  Although I'd switch out Defensive Aura with Redoubt personally, especially if you have AoE tank aspirations.</div>

		<div id="post_message_520968">I want to comment really quick on the viability of a holy build as an offtank build.  Basically since I hit 70, this (<a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?talent=sVxhrxzheotVMphMc" target="_blank">Talent Calculator - World of Warcraft</a>) has been my Holy build whenever I'm not full protection.  I used it for pvp, arena, 5 mans, kara, heroics, and 25 mans and I used it right up to the point that I got put into a predominantly tanking position in our raids.  You can very very easily tank every 5 man with this spec.  You can tank heroics as well - to prove that paladins can tank I took my gm on a heroic mech run that I tanked as holy while he thought I was protection.  Run went smoothly, I was wearing no better than kara gear (and if you check my armory you'll notice I'm still short on armor, I have a blue chest piece still!)  I have been the resident paladin tank since we started doing 25 mans and each situation that I've tanked in a 25 man up until about 2 weeks ago, I did as full 41/20 holy prot.<br>
<br>
I tank the murlocs during tidewalker in full tanking gear with a holy spec.  I tank tons of trash, most notably the trash on the way to and in the room of solarian.  Holy Guidance is actually quite helpful, for example, on tidewalker because I use heals to get aggro on all of the murlocs and every extra bit helps.  I tanked heroic black morass, mechanar, slave pens, and sethekk and I'm sure I could do more.  The caveat is that at the time that I was needed to be tanking heroics for people, I had most of my kara tanking gear already - take that as you will.<br>
<br>
If you're going to tank bosses, go full protection (41/12+8) but for healing with some offtanking on the side, I don't think any more than 13-14 points in prot is required, bearing in mind that you need to be prepared and make smart gear choices (keeping 490 def can sometimes be a bitch if you don't have anticipation given how paladins stack stamina).</div>

		<div id="post_message_521136">Personally I've tried, but I've noticed I feel more inadequate in any tanking role without Holy Shield, than I feel in a healing role without holy talents past Illumination. Your mileage may vary of course.<br>
<br>
Either way, I'll still make some changes to cover tanking in general regardless of whether you're heavy protection or you only have improved righteous fury. One of the additions I've made in that direction is adding Holy Shock to the list of spell damage to threat conversions. I've tried searching for it but couldn't find any data on the spell damage coefficients for Holy Wrath and Avenger's Shield. If someone has those somewhere I'd appreciate it.<br>
<br>
I'm still working on more updates right now, I just added some of the "easy" stuff to add first.<br>
<br>
Edit:<br>
<br>
Added a few more updates. Check the change log for details.</div>

</div>Anyhow, a few basic macros would help, so here is another one:<br>
<br>
Q u o t e:<br>
#showtooltip Divine Shield <br>
/cast Divine Shield<br>
/cancelaura Divine Shield<br>
<br>
(You can of course also make a macro that uses DS if you press it and if you hold lets say STRG and press it it will cancel it. Or make another button for the /cancelaura removal. But for your one klick break/dispell this would be the macro).<br>
<br>
--------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Request for some Math,<br>
<br>
Seal of Vengance vs. Seal of Righteousness. I heard there is a breaking point where Righteousness will be better (due to the very high +Spelldamage on the Judgement) then SoV on TPS.<br>
<br>
Can somebody who is really good at math calculate that? SoR is not that hard, but for the ticks/uptime on SoV I'm lost. Also possible to just compare 5 Stacks with SoR. For Bossfights the first 10 Sec are not that important.<br>
<br>
Using a 1,6 or 1,8 Sek Weapon (there are no decent slow tanking weapons with 200+ Spelldamage) against a Level 73 Opponent (Assuming about +5% Spell Hit on the Paladins Side. With 3% in a Talent about 2% on Equip is possible). Also let's say about 3-5% Melee hit.<br>
<br>
(And yes I think it is strange that the Seal of Blood outperforms SoCommand by about 5-20% (depending on haste) while the Alliance Seal is worse then the SoR with high enough Spell damage. At least that is what I heard..)</div>

</div>The first condition casts the spell on your target if it's friendly.  The second condition casts the spell on your target's target, if it's friendly (i.e. you're tanking a mob, someone pulls aggro, this taunts it back to you).  The last simply gives you a glowy hand so you can then click on a party members frame, I use this part when we get adds or if AoE tanking and a non-target mob changes targets.  Much easier than manually changing targets.</div>

</div>Really simplified version:<br>
<br>
5 stack SoV - 100% of your +dmg over 15 seconds, or 6.67% of your +dmg as DPS, 50 base DPS<br>
5 stack JoV - 43% of your +dmg, 600 base damage; judged every 10 seconds, that's 4.3% of +dmg as DPS, 60 base DPS.<br>
<br>
TOTAL SoV damage:   11~% of +dmg as DPS, 110 base DPS<br>
<br>
<br>
1H SoR - 9~% of your +dmg as DPS, 30?? base DPS (I forgot the exact number, but it's around 30)<br>
JoR - 73% of your +dmg, 170~ base damage; judged every 10 seconds, that's 7.3% of +dmg as DPS, 17 base DPS<br>
<br>
TOTAL SoR damage:  16.3% of +dmg as DPS, 47 base DPS <br>
<br>
<br>
<b>SoV has better base damage, SoR has better scaling.</b><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
For SoR's scaling to catch up to SoV's base damage, you need<br>
difference in base DPS - 110 - 47 = 63 DPS<br>
<i>divided by </i><br>
difference in DPS scaling - 16.3% - 11% = 5.3% +dmg/DPS <br>
<br>
<br>
63 / 5.3% = 1189 +dmg <br>
<br>
<b>SoR has better overall damage than SoV when you have more than 1189 +dmg, the point where SoR scaling makes up for SoV's higher base damage</b><br>
<br>
<br>
This analysis ignores <br>
- unequal effects of +damage% modifiers (SoV didn't get the effect of 1h spec when I tested it a few PTRs ago, but that was before the 10%-&gt;5% damag echange<br>
- the ability to boost SoV's DoT damage via AW+trinkets (like trinketed lifebloom ticks, or the poison stack from scorpid pets)<br>
- the ramp up time of SoV (have to build up 5 stacks to have all of SoV's scaling)<br>
- the tendency of SoV to fall off or get resisted on boss type mobs <br>
- proc rate unreliability on fast weapons (combined with point above, makes it tougher to use on some fights)  <br>
- instant damage procs on 5 stack SoV (which are weapon speed dependent...)<br>
<i>- EDIT:  The effect of Reckoning on SoR/SoV scaling (favors SoR)<br>
- EDIT:  The iSoR talent </i><br>

</div>I've been using Bloodmaw basically since our second gruul kill, many months ago.  It's good for spell damage but like has been said, it's about 15 sta short.  I keep my cont blade around for those times that I don't need extra threat but may need the extra stamina, same reason I keep around my crest of the sha'tar after having the NB shield for so long.<br>
<br>
Personally, I have divine shield hotkeyed and I have a separate macro for when I want to cancel it.  This way, when I know I need to just break something, I hit my hotkey while moving my mouse over the extra /cancelaura Divine Shield macro.  This means that I can still spam my DS hotkey without fear of it accidentally cancelling my shield and I can quickly break debuffs while tanking with an extra click.<br>
<br>
I have a mage alt and I use the all-in-one that is mentioned above except with the cancelaura first:<br>
/cancelaura Ice Block<br>
/cast Ice Block<br>
<br>
Hit once for a block, twice to break things quickly.</div>

		<div id="post_message_521957">An update (from the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304065107/http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t10440-paladin_mtanking_viability_thread/" target="_blank">[Paladin] MT Viability</a> thread, which I am posting here because this new thread is easier to browse):<br>
<br>
Illidan is dead. I tanked him the entire time. This was our guild first kill of him, so this was not a case of severely out-gearing the encounter or having the boss on farm already. I'm not sure if this is a "world first" but I can say it was not easy. I think we took a few years off of the lives of our healers during that fight...<br>
<br>
However, it became abundantly clear during the final phases of the fight that Warriors are simply better tanks for MT situations like this.<br>
- 6% reduction vs 10% reduction means he hits for ~1k more on average, but top-end damage means he can hit for 9k, 5k, 9k in a matter of 1.5seconds on a protpally where a warrior would only take 8k, 4k, 8k - in split-seconds like that, 3k damage can be the difference of "insta-gib" and "barely making it." This becomes even more apparent during Phase 5 when he Enrages and begins hitting for 11k/8k even faster...<br>
- The 1500hp difference between Warriors and Protpallies makes the above "insta-gib" factor even more likely to occur - if the healers are already not winding up heals and loading you up with full HoTs, you're gonna get splattered.<br>
- The fact that Protpallies have no Last Stand or Shield Wall to help with Enrage or similar abilities means that your healers have to be balls-to-the-wall 100% of the time, and an unlucky streak (which WILL happen) simply will be too much for even successive-9k-heals to overcome.<br>
- Holy Shield sucks for MT purposes as it is now - it is impossible to remain uncrushable reliably with it on boss fights because of the .5-1sec lag-time between it falling off and the cooldown allowing you to put it back on... as opposed to Shield block that has 1sec longer duration than the cooldown. <br>
<br>
So either you gotta be really lucky or much more geared than a Warrior at the same level to begin to reach for the upper-echelon MT spots. It's unfortunate, but until we start getting some more "oh shit" buttons and more passive damage mitigation we won't be able to stand toe-to-toe with Warriors - the HP buff in 2.3 helps get near them, but it isn't going to be enough to compensate for the other deficiencies.<br>
<br>
Another note:<br>
I hit the buff cap during the fight regularly, and I often found my flasks getting pushed off because of all the HoTs and buffs I received during the fight. I'm not sure if this is a problem specific to Protpallies (since we have Righteous Defense up, another buff in the slot) but I'm fairly sure it caused a wipe once or twice when my max health suddenly dropped  due to Fort/MotW and Flask falling off.</div>

</div>Hey Fiola, just to let you know that the coefficient for a 5 stack SoV tick is actually 85% not 100% of spell damage. There is a discussion in the first page of this thread between Theras and myself about it.<br>
<br>
I do also believe that SoV is being effected by 1HWS from the numbers i tested.<br>
<br>
I have a spreadheets simiar to my ret spreadsheet for paladin TPS. Will try to get it into a publishable form if i get the time.<br>
<br>
Two question you might be be able to answer that i've asked in the Ret thread but is more applied to tanking damage is with consecration....<br>
<br>
1) When you downrank consecration, the extra damage cause by +spell damage is scaled down. However the extra damage caused by JotC (219*0.95) is not scaled down and is still applied in full to Rank 1 Consecration. Why is this?<br>
<br>
2) The extra damage from +spell damage gets effected by dmg modifiers such as sanctity aura, AW etc etc, but the extra damage caused by SotC is not. Again, why is this.<br>
<br>
Cheers</div>

		<div id="post_message_522298">The only explanation I can come up with for those mechanics is that Judgement of the Crusader is a debuff on your target, and because of that gets calculated after Blizzard does the other stuff.<br>
<br>
That is, the spell's damage first gets locally calculated on a player basis, and then based on the results that already exist we get the target's buffs/debuffs spell damage added. It would be interesting to test how this works with other spells, and if Dampen and Amplify Magic also use a formula like this. It might also just be an individual thing unique to consecration, though you'd wonder if other AoE effects like it would work the same way; I'm thinking in the direction of Flamestrike here mostly.<br>
<br>
E.G. The actual formula would end up looking like this:<br>
<br>
Damage Dealt = ( ( Base + ( Spell Damage * Coefficient * Level Penalty ) ) * Talents * Multiplier Buffs * Multiplier Debuffs ) + ( ( Target Spell Damage Taken Buffs + Debuffs ) * Coefficient )<br>
<br>
Edit:<br>
<br>
On the subject of buffs. I do think we have a few extra buffs a Warrior tank would not have. Righteous Fury and Holy Shield have equals in Defensive Stance and Shield Block, but we also use a Seal on top of that, and it wouldn't surprise me too much if some weird mystic buff voodoo goes on with Judgement refreshing, which might take up another extra buff slot. Reckoning and Redoubt also both cover extra buff slots we use; though depending on gear used that could be equalled through set bonus procs.<br>
<br>
Buff slots are, as far as I know, limited to 32.</div>

<br>
I forgot to mention i did do a brief test with SoR. The extra damage caused by JotC does get effected by multipliers (thus not to do with it being a debuff)<br>
<br>
My initial thought is that the level modifier is attached to the spell damage coefficient and since spell damage gear is all schools and JotC is holy only, they forgot too attach this level modifier to holy damage. Would be interesting to test it out with the +holy damage cloak from Karazhan.<br>
<br>
As for the % modifiers, that has me stumped. The SoR test shows it is not to do with debuffs or with the type of plus damage. My only though could be it is due to the calculation of consecration (being a DoT) and they have messed up somewhere with it</div>

</div>That's what I get for using someone else's numbers.  X P <br>
<br>
It was 68% over 12 seconds, and the buff to 15 seconds only increased duration, not DPS, so 85% is correct.  <br>

That brings the +dmg value for break even point to 1000~, though it's still ignoring the new instant damage SoV procs and Reckoning. <br>

</div>I can't really answer the "why", but I know there's no downrank penalty on JotC for Consecrate or JoC R1.  <br>
<br>
<br>
If I would venture a guess, there's a +dmg value on your character and a +dmg value for the mob (debuff - increased damage taken by up to XYZ) that are added for the coefficient calculation.   The character +dmg value is re-calculated by some spell level penalty, but that penalty is not applied to the mob's +dmg value.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Does anyone know how amplify/dampen magic/Ferundicity (Ribbon of Sacrifice on use effect) affect downranked heals?   That might shed some more light on this.  <br>

</div>Think that would be a great idea. There are so many oddities/inconsistencies/plain fubar mechanics i have come accross when trying to model dps/tps, would be great to get them all in one place. Bet you a few of them would make blizz developers think 'why the hell is it working like that'.<br>
<br>
As for the BoL downranking, havent looked at it, but assumed it would be treated in a similar way to level downranking. I do know that it screws over HL low rank spam.</div>

</div>I lost Reckoning a long time ago and haven't missed it at all. It only boosts threat from white damage and Seal of Righteousness procs, whereas 1h spec increases all damage done across the board. Combat Expertise and Precision will be generally the same amount of threat increase, plus you won't miss as much when initially building threat, which is really important.<br>
<br>
I also don't miss it when AOE soloing. Supplicants are a joke still, and I can pull an entire room of Nethermine Flayers plus Ravagers still, and as long as I  have the Figurine of the Colossus, it turns out well.</div>

Reckoning is a doubling of sword damage (and SoR in theory) 10% of the time. Or 10% damage more<br>
<br>
For 1hws to be better, the total damage a paladin does *1.05 needs to be greater than weapon+SoR * 1.10<br>
<br>
I don't remember the exact amounts for threat by source, but I thought holy shield was 25% of threat, consecrate was something like 40%, and weapon/sor was about 30%. But let's figure it out.<br>
<br>
1.05*all damage includes weapon + SoR too, so the extra damage that reckoning does over 1hws is 1.05 greater. So 1.05*weapon+SoR must be greater than total other damage * 1.05. In other words, the damage done from weapon +SoR must be at least as much as all other damage done by the paladin. <br>

</div>Not exactly; for what I was doing, all I need to figure out is how much threat reckoning does relative to the other abilities of a paladin. Now, figuring out what the relative threat is has been done elsewhere; I'm just stating what the overall threat output of reckoning has to be compared to overtaking 1hws. <br>
<br>
I'm less sold on the usefulness of the spell damage abilities compared to reckoning, but it really depends on the attack speed of the boss/mob hitting you, whether you need that improved threat, and what you'll be tanking. I suspect reckoning is more useful than spell warding but loses out on improved PoJ.</div>

</div>Reckoning uptime is dependent on the # of times you're hit.   Are you misreading the talent?  <br>
<br>
<br>
If you were to get hit, say, 8 times over 8 seconds, you'd have a 34% chance (90% ^ 8) not to trigger reckoning.   That means the other 66% of the time, Reckoning would be active and adding 100% autoswing damage.  100% bonus damage 66% of the time averages to 66% average bonus autoswing damage.   <br>
<br>
<br>
In this case, you have the choice of 5% more overall damage, or 66% more autoswing damage.   Which yields more damage?  Which yields more threat?   .   <br>
<br>
<br>
It's more complicated than that, but I'm pretty sure your premise is faulty.</div>

<br>
Reckoning doesn't proc if you don't take damage, remember. Against the same boss, a paladin with an absurdly low 50% combined miss/dodge/parry chance has a (0.9)^4 = 66% chance of no procs. It'll be higher for a paladin with better avoidance.<br>
<br>
So it's more like 34% more autoswing damage (and 34% more boss parries) versus 5% to all threat.<br>
<br>
Is a 34% boost to white damage and SoR more than 5% of total threat? What about when tanking more than one mob?</div>

I am certain that we get buff aggro of a nontrivial amount.  I'm also certain I can rip aggro by abusing that fact and sealing/resealing repeatedly as they spawn, with everyone standing on top of me into my Cons.  So if people are standing on top of me and not doing much of anything till I call aoe on, I can reliably get very good aggro on every mob.<br>
<br>
And not to play backseat mod, and this isn't my thread- but shouldn't we do most Q&amp;A in the MT thread and save this for stuff directly relivant to the OP?  This thread is more of an abstract, we should probably do specific boss/encounter stuff over there.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">However, it became abundantly clear during the final phases of the fight that Warriors are simply better tanks for MT situations like this.<br>
- 6% reduction vs 10% reduction means he hits for ~1k more on average, but top-end damage means he can hit for 9k, 5k, 9k in a matter of 1.5seconds on a protpally where a warrior would only take 8k, 4k, 8k - in split-seconds like that, 3k damage can be the difference of "insta-gib" and "barely making it." This becomes even more apparent during Phase 5 when he Enrages and begins hitting for 11k/8k even faster...</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Hang on; I'm not sure I buy this effect being quite so large unless there's a pretty significant gear gap.  The raw difference before shield blocking is applied should have the paladin taking a bit more than 4% more damage than the warrior.  Shield block value will tend to widen the difference, but you'd need something like 10k block value to turn a 9k hit into an 8k hit.<br>
<br>
If we assume a largish block value of 1k, then a blocked blow that does 9k damage to a paladin should do (9000+1000)*(0.90/0.94) - 1000 = 8574 damage to the warrior.  That's not a negligible difference, but it's less than half of 1k.  The 5k hit on the paladin is going to hit for 4744 on the warrior, so your total difference for the 9k+5k+9k chain is going to be around 1.1k, not 3k.<br>
<br>
And on a fight like Illidan (as I understand he dual-wields and you need to save SB/HS for Shear) I would expect a paladin to be blocking a decent bit more often than a warrior, which would make up most of the gap.<br>
<br>
Have you observed a warrior geared comparably to yourself under the same conditions?  I'm guessing you haven't (since if you had, and you'd seen these differences, I'd think you would have had the warrior do it) so... I mean, I believe that you were getting hit really hard, but it might just be that he was hitting you really hard because that's what he does.<br>
<br>
Disclaimer:  Haven't seen the fight myself, so I may be misunderstanding the mechanics, and I certainly agree with your other points re: Shield Wall/Last Stand and the hp gap.<br>

</div>Yes.  This actually became an issue on Twin Emps, which was the first fight that really required you to fully optimize your tanks.  It was worse at the time because many equip bonuses on items actually functioned by adding invisible buffs to your character, which counted against your buff limit (this has been corrected since) and so at some point in the fight an MT's buff bar would occasionally overflow and the tank would lose Defensive Stance and go into a stance-less state, during which he would take 10% more damage and be unable to shield block, and hence basically die.<br>

</div>This is what I do and it basically lets the AoE open up immediately, which means the adds are pretty much dead once the priests spawn.  There's really no need to get solid aggro on all of them; any random clothie should be fine with 1-2 adds beating on him so long as the healers aren't asleep.  You just need to get them locked down well enough to prevent all the adds going after your highest-threat AoEer.</div>

<br>
At the start of the fight I usually hit him with a SOR judgement, get sor hits in untill I can judge again and then build up sov charges. Now when he goes into ww have your AS shield ready and cast it when the ww timer is on 0.5 sec. Also have a sor judgement ready for backup and extra threat. Doing this made me grab the mob back everytime. If both miss u still have the sov charges and the usual totem in the middle.<br>
Rinse and repeat everytime for the human phase and u will have 0 dps dieing from aggro.<br>

I was MT on our second kill instead of a warrior and we had 0 dead people instead of 17 because of him slaughtering ranged dps.</div>

</div>Strictly speaking, this isn't entirely true.  Judgement of Blood is unaffected by spell hit insofar as currently on live it never misses. Judgment of Blood is guaranteed to do some damage (you can get a level difference based partial resist I believe).<br>
<br>
You can imagine situations where that might prove useful, so perhaps this fact should also be noted in the tips section as well.  It's usually the seal I have up at the start of pulls (or when I know I need to pick a target up) for this very reason.</div>

</div>Reckoning and Redoubt both only proc when you actually take damage. Also the increase in parry chance is fairly meaningless; though as far as tanking go we're still the tank capable of taking the lowest burst, reckoning doesn't even come close to the amount of extra parries warriors get through their instants; I'm not too familiar with druid tanks in regards to instants, but I'm certain they'll also use more attacks than us that are likely to get parried. Using Seal of Blood is probably a worse thing to do if you're worried about getting parried more than speccing reckoning is.</div>

@ Liar, you sure with Demo-Shout? Cause 50 Threat on 5 Targets would just be nothing.. Even just activation of our Seal does (according to this test) 120 Threat so this would be more than twice of Demo-Shout.<br>
<br>
And for us, re-buffing us with Seal of Righteousness is something we do all the time (ok, every 8 Sec.), so this is just free Threat. And nothing wrong with that.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Strictly speaking, this isn't entirely true.  Judgement of Blood is unaffected by spell hit insofar as currently on live it never misses. Judgment of Blood is guaranteed to do some damage (you can get a level difference based partial resist I believe).<br>
<br>
You can imagine situations where that might prove useful, so perhaps this fact should also be noted in the tips section as well.  It's usually the seal I have up at the start of pulls (or when I know I need to pick a target up) for this very reason.</div>

</div>You sure?   <br>
<br>
That's an interesting plus for JoB, though I guess it simplifies the self-damage portion of it.  (ie: Should JoB deal damage to yourself if it's resisted by your target?)  <br>
<br>
JoC used to never miss either, but they changed that a few patches after 1.9.  <br>
<br>
<br>
That said... what happens when you cast JoB on a CloS'd rogue?  Resist check?  Guaranteed hit?</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Hang on; I'm not sure I buy this effect being quite so large unless there's a pretty significant gear gap.  The raw difference before shield blocking is applied should have the paladin taking a bit more than 4% more damage than the warrior.  Shield block value will tend to widen the difference, but you'd need something like 10k block value to turn a 9k hit into an 8k hit.<br>
<br>
If we assume a largish block value of 1k, then a blocked blow that does 9k damage to a paladin should do (9000+1000)*(0.90/0.94) - 1000 = 8574 damage to the warrior.  That's not a negligible difference, but it's less than half of 1k.  The 5k hit on the paladin is going to hit for 4744 on the warrior, so your total difference for the 9k+5k+9k chain is going to be around 1.1k, not 3k.</div>

</div>I was kinda lumping the "Warriors have over double our Block Value" and "Warriors have more flat% reduction" together, but Illidan's main-hand hits for ~24k before armor and %reduction results in ~600 difference, combined with ~300 more block value that warriors have... it adds up.<br>

</div>Well, I can't be certain, but according to combat logs my last 200+ or so judgements of blood have all landed.  Other paladins have noted the same -- and in 1000s of attempts in some cases.  It does less damage/threat than righteousness, but obviously there's significant use in being able to guarantee something lands.<br>
<br>
You can't judge blood on magic immune targets, but seal of blood will actually do damage to a magic immune target.  Or, at least, it did damage to the Aran trash in the Kara library.  That's an interesting quirk.  Does seal of command function the same way?<br>

I've never attempted to judge blood on a CloS'd rogue, but I'll try it next time I see one and let you know.</div>

I only browsed through about 200 Judgements worth though, and there's obviously the chance it's based on melee hit, but I assume it's correct for now since the original report came from a Prot Paladin.<br>

Also double checked to make sure it isn't the same bug as Holy Shield and Greater Blessing of Sanctuary have (Both of those show as "&lt;player&gt; resists &lt;mob&gt;'s &lt;ability&gt;" despite being used by you), so it seems Judgement of Blood is indeed incapable of resisting in PvE situations.</div>

</div>No, you're right. Reckoning procs are dependent on how often you're hit for damage and that's both gear and mob dependent. I was taking a shorthand, basically saying that over time, all things being equal you're going to proc reckoning about 10% of the time, but that's obviously simplified. <br>
<br>
For it to be 10%, it means you need to trigger reckoning for 8 seconds every 80 seconds. That's likely too low. Triggering it constantly would double your white damage and your SoR damage, but that's equally unlikely to happen against a single boss and with the kind of avoidance/mitigation you're likely to have. <br>
<br>
I'll see if I can do a quickie calculator on what the likely proc rate is and what the overall threat increase is relative to other abilities. My suspicion is that the threat produced by white damage is small relative to overall damage, and even the threat produced by white +SoR is not that great on the whole scheme of things. On fast-hitting bosses this might be better for producing threat, but the question is whether more threat production is the real important factor for protection paladins instead of better mitigation and hit points.</div>

		<div id="post_message_525676">This is all taken from the Lurker Below stats.<br>
<br>
I guess the more important point to me from those stats is that 22% of the damage done was white damage, another 19% was SoR damage. And reckoning procced 10 times in that fight, but there were only 32 extra swings from reckoning recorded. (that's independent of whether it recorded a reckoning proc) Out of 284 melee hits, 32 were reckoning - or about 11.2% more swings. Again roughly, 11.2% of the 41% from SoR and melee means that reckoning caused about 4.61% of the overall damage - which is lower than the 5% boost to damage. However, threat isn't damage, so we need to reduce that. <br>
<br>
Hmm, let's take that a bit further. <br>
22% * 1.0 + 19% * 1.9 = 56.1 total non-normalized threat from melee/SoR. <br>
22% * 1.0 + 74% * 1.9 = 140.6 total non-normalized threat from sources that would get the 5% bonus (basically, everything that wasn't nature damage)<br>
<br>
11.2% of the 56.1 = 6.32 threat from melee/SoR that was extra from reckoning<br>
140.6 * 5% = 7.03 threat from all sources given a bonus of 1hws<br>
<br>
From this, it looks like reckoning does not outperform 1hws in overall threat produced. Now, keep in mind I didn't reduce the reckoning damage by 5% from the loss of 1hws, and I didn't take out the reckoning damage from the total, so these things are slightly off - but at the very least it should be comparable.</div>

</div>...you know, I had never actually gone through the parses for exactly how much our warriors block for in "normal" tanking gear. I was basing my numbers off of a comment from our MT about having a "threat" set that gets his Block Value past 700. Since Block Value is a much more important threat-generation stat for Warriors I figured that wasn't much higher than his normal. <br>
<br>
Yet again I stand corrected - I block for 420 in my high-avoidance gear, where our MT blocks for 441.<br>
<br>
So where is all this extra damage coming from? My guess is (on bosses that can crush), the extra crushing blows that sneak through the .5-to-1 second gap where Holy Shield is between cooldown and re-application.</div>

So basically on the whole fight you take 0.75% more damage due to the 1s delay between holy shields. It's actually a little more since a crush is more than 1.5x of a block but not that much. Now if you reduce the delay to 0.5s you get 1/2 the effect, and on top you'd need to reduce the times when redoubt covered for that hole. Overall total damage taken should be insignificantly bigger, the only problem I would see is with the (vert) rare spike damage, as no matter how rare it is all it needs is to make your HP hit 0 *once* and you're dead. But I really don't see how it can account for "needing more healing" as the extra total healing needed is really nothing.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">...you know, I had never actually gone through the parses for exactly how much our warriors block for in "normal" tanking gear. I was basing my numbers off of a comment from our MT about having a "threat" set that gets his Block Value past 700. Since Block Value is a much more important threat-generation stat for Warriors I figured that wasn't much higher than his normal. <br>
<br>
Yet again I stand corrected - I block for 420 in my high-avoidance gear, where our MT blocks for 441.<br>
<br>
So where is all this extra damage coming from? My guess is (on bosses that can crush), the extra crushing blows that sneak through the .5-to-1 second gap where Holy Shield is between cooldown and re-application.</div>

</div>I can't find where your warrior MT'ed illidan in those parses, so I can't make a direct comparison.  However, when you say you're much harder to heal, is just the healers complaining or is there numerical evidence for it?  Because it could just be in their heads =P</div>

</div>As I know this happens, that small chance of rolling in that 15% crush area when encountering this is small, as the person said above redoubt can fill the whole you can dodge/miss/parry the attack in that second or the boss' swing timer can simply not be back up in that .5 second.<br>
<br>
Although I can't say this about the warriors in other guilds the ones in mine will get crushed on average ~4-5 times a fight (whether that's from laziness or somthing else I'm not sure) but I can say I've gone complete clears MT'ing and never getting crushed, so that 'extra' dmg certainly cannot be solely contributed to the CD/Duration of Holy shield.</div>

</div>Well, assuming 5% base miss chance (and no +spell hit gear on your part), a rogue with CloS should have a 95% chance to resist spells.  <br>
<br>
If JoBs could be resisted (and were based off of +spell hit), the chances of 3 hits with that resist rate would be 5% ^ 3, or ~.01%.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Combined with the experience/WWS of raiding BElf paladins, I think that the evidence shows JoB is guaranteed to hit (no resist check, like debuff judgements).   That's nice.</div>

</div>In terms of threat it's actually quite a nice build, just getting beaten by a 33/28 build which includes 3 points in vengeance. Though with weapon expertise giving stamina in 2.3 i'm becoming a fan of a 0/40/21 build. It means sacrificing precision/reckoning/argent defender/avengers shield but means you get crusade and sanctity aura. It all depends on the situation really.</div>

</div>There's definitely situations I can see that build being powerful. I'm pretty sure that if you don't need to aggro up to three adds solidly at any point in your tanking career, you'll be getting more threat out of Sanctity Aura; and that for a lower mana cost as well. For raiding in particular Avenger's Shield isn't really needed outside of a very few fights in-game; I'd hate to be without it for tanking at Shade of Akama for example, though I'm certain I could manage without with some effort.<br>
<br>
The downside really is in the fact that you lose Ardent Defender and Reckoning; Ardent Defender is most likely not worth speccing for if you can only put 2 points in it. I was thinking in this direction myself: <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?talent=sZVhxIh0dMgoxVfx0bcz" target="_blank">Talent Calculator - World of Warcraft</a> (If you take out the points in Ret, get Avenger's Shield, and put the 'basic 20' in Holy you'll get the build I'm probably taking next patch)<br>
<br>
From a pure threat point of view in any situation this build is going to be pretty strong. It'll actually sport ~19% more damage (and thus threat) on practically everything you'll face while raiding. I'd say it's also got good survivability in a single hard-hitting target situation. It'll be less good than a build with Ardent Defender at taking damage in a situation with a lot of smaller faster attacks though, and it also lacks Reckoning which is a nice threat boost in a situation in which you're tanking a lot of mobs and are also expected to outaggro single target DPS on a specific mob.</div>

My standard rotation for tanking is:<br>
Holy Shield &gt;&gt;&gt; Judge (No GCD) &gt;&gt;&gt; Consecrate &gt;&gt;&gt; Seal of Righteousness<br>
Reason for putting the judgement between holy shield and consecrate is it does not use global cooldown, however there is a delay between when you judge and when you can replace your seal.  This will also leave you about 4 seconds of your tanking rotation unused, this is when you can try to throw in Holy shield, or taunt extra mobs, Exorcise, Hammer of Wrath.</div>

		<div id="post_message_527869">Talking about builds, I would like to reintroduce the discussion of what would be the new MT paladin build in replacement of the old 49/12 variations pre-2.3.<br>
<br>
For now I'm thinking on going with this:<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304040016/http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/classes/paladin/talents.html?0000000000000000000005305133500021025215510520500000000000000000" target="_blank">WorldofWarcraft.com -&gt; Info -&gt; Classes -&gt; Paladin -&gt; Talent Calculator</a><br>
<br>
Issues:<br>
<br>
- Dropped Reckoning in order to obtain the requisite 5 points for the new Combat Expertise. My reason is that of all threat boosting talents this was the most "dangerous" since it provokes more boss parries (and I'm feeling the increase of thrashes after switching to the Merciless Gavel, one second faster than my old Gavel of Unhearted Secrets). Hopefully the loss in threat won't be significant, although I hate the loss of AoE farming efficiency.<br>
<br>
- Didn't take the new PoJ. It's a proc and not nothing I can rely on consistently to diminish influx of magic damage or make spikes more palateable.<br>
<br>
- Imp Judgement are 2 points that I'm kinda more willing to maybe give out. I don't often profit from the reduced CD on judgement in raids due to encroaching CDs, although it's handy in smaller content. I could get a couple in the new Imp. SoC talent to increase raid DPS overall.<br>
<br>
What do you think?<br>
<br>
Oh, and excellent guide by the way. Regarding professions, I've found to be enchanter extremely useful, due to the +24 spelldamage made available through ring slots (and even extra stats if you are at Hyjal level).</div>

</div>I'm going to try laying out threat cycles with ASCII.<br>
<br>
Here's a basic threat cycle without Imp. Judgement:<br>

<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:0px"><img src="assets/code_html.gif" border="0"></div>

		border: 1px inset;
		width: 694px;
		height: 66px;
		text-align: left;
		overflow: auto">0---1---2---3---4---5---6---7---8---9---|
[HS  ][SoR ][Cons]
      J</pre>
</div>The first line is the timeline in seconds.  The second line is the sequence of GCD rotations, each of which takes 1.5 seconds.  (I'm padding each ability to take up exactly six characters including brackets, which corresponds to 1.5 seconds on the timeline.)  The letter J on the third line represents the time when Judgement is used; in this case SoR is cast immediately after Judgement, so there's no time spent unsealed.   (And no, there is no way to get that ugly extra whitespace out of the bottom of the code box.)<br>
<br>
We're assuming that we're dealing with a crushing-blow situation, so Holy Shield <i>must</i> be cast every ten seconds come hell or high water.  This means there's no way to cast Consecration more than once every 10 seconds -- the next cast can't come before 9.5 seconds, and that would delay HS til one second into the next cycle, which isn't something we can afford to do.  So the cycle above simply repeats every 10 seconds.<br>
<br>
Now, let's look at the case where we have Imp. Judgement.  In this case we have the ability to shuffle things around a bit, so the cycle looks a bit different from one iteration to the next:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:0px"><img src="assets/code_html.gif" border="0"></div>
	<pre class="alt2" dir="ltr" style="
		margin: 0px;
		padding: 3px;
		border: 1px inset;
		width: 694px;
		height: 258px;
		text-align: left;
		overflow: auto">   0---1---2---3---4---5---6---7---8---9---|
1: [HS  ][SoR ][Cons]
         J                               J

   0---1---2---3---4---5---6---7---8---9---|
2: [HS  ][SoR ][Cons]            [SoR ]
                                 J

   0---1---2---3---4---5---6---7---8---9---|
3: [HS  ][Cons]          [SoR ]
                         J

   0---1---2---3---4---5---6---7---8---9---|
4: [HS  ][Cons]  [SoR ]
                 J</pre>
</div>So, this gets us five judgements in 40 seconds, as opposed to four judgements in 40 seconds for the non-Imp. Judgement cycle.  In exchance for this, we go two seconds without a seal (from 9.5s of the first line to 1.5s of the second line.)  In the simplest terms, over a long fight Imp Judgement <b>increases JoR damage by 25%</b> but <b>decreases SoR damage by 5%</b>.<br>
<br>
As a rough benchmark, on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304040016/http://eleventhhour.org/wws/wws-20071023-2127/cathela.html" target="_blank">our last Void Reaver kill</a>, I did 41,509 damage with SoR and 27,020 damage with JoR.  (I didn't have aggro for the whole fight, but since I don't have Imp. Judgement, I was doing the same seal/judge routine when I didn't have aggro as I was doing when I did have aggro.)  If I'd had Imp. Judgement, I would have gained 6755 damage from JoR and lost 2075 damage from SoR, for a net gain of 4680 damage, or a net gain of 6.8% of total JoR+SoR damage (and hence the same gain in total JoR+SoR threat.)<br>
<br>
I can't say how that would look as a fraction of total threat, since I don't think I've ever tanked a traditional tank-and-spank 25-man boss, but if someone else wants to offer up a WWS of something like MTing Morogrim or Gruul, we can check it out.</div>

<br>
SoV dps formula is (750+0.85*+damage)/15<br>
<br>
Had a TPS spreadsheet in the works myself similar to the dps on i had. However with lack of time think i'll pass on it, but here are some little tips i would suggest.<br>
<br>
1) Include a partial resist value (about 4%) as this does have a significant effect on threat<br>
2) Check the different skill calculations for including resists as i believe some of them are slightly off. From my testing i found out:-<br>
<br>
SoR can be Partially resisted, but not fully resisted<br>
SoV Dot can be partially resisted, but noy fully resisted<br>
SoV 5 stack hit can be fully resisted (not 100% sure about partial resist)<br>
JoR/JoV can be resisted and partially resisted<br>
Consecration's first tick can be resisted, and any tick can be partially resisted<br>
Holy Shield can be fully resisted but not partially resisted<br>
Retribution Aura can be resisted and partially resisted<br>
Blessing of Sanctuary can be fully resisted but not partially<br>
Thorns and Fire shield can be partially and fully resisted<br>
Darkmoon card Vengeance and Ashtongue Talisman of Zeal can be resisted but not paritally<br>
<br>
In addition when it comes to consecration and judgement of the crusader be careful with the calculations.<br>
A) The extra damage from JoTC is not subject to diminishing returns when lowering rank. Will always get the 219*0.95 damage<br>
B) The extra damage from JoTC (219*0.95) does NOT get modified by % modifiers such as Sanctity Aura, 1HWS, Avenging Wrathe etc<br>
<br>
When it comes to cycle time, its impossible to HS/Consecration/Judge on cooldown and keep seal at 100% uptime. However i never did the theory to work out the optimal rotation.<br>
<br>
Anyway, hope this is of use</div>

		<div id="post_message_528190">How about specs with improved seal of crusader (or pursuit of justice)?<br>
<br>
No matter how i look at it, there has to be at least one point "drained" from other talents... and no more then one if we're skipping T4 talents entirely and dropping spell warding with reckoning (which is what i plan to do - it's still 6% more spell mitigation then druids anyway). Dropping point in which talent is lowest reduction in mitigation?<br>
<br>
Shield Specialization? Anticipation? Toughness?<br>
<br>
Dropping single point in Toughness will cost me about 320-360 armor (out of ~18000 raidbuffed)... or about 0.5% of additional armor mitigation.<br>
<br>
Dropping single point in Shield Specialization - about 30 block value (maybe even 40-50 with new badge loot).. also about ~0.5% of average boss attack i guess, and in aoe situations not every attack is blocked (but relative reduction on each block is a lot higher)<br>
<br>
Dropping single point in Anticipation - 0.16% miss/dodge/parry/block... looks like heaviest hit out of them all.<br>

</div>The 10% strength is pretty much irrelevant, it'd only increase your white DPS and that's entire unaffected by Righteous Fury. So we're looking here at Improved Seal of Righteousness versus One-Handed Weapon Specialization.<br>
<br>
One-Handed Weapon Specialization is easy enough to calculate, it'll increase your total threat output by 5%. Improved Seal of Righteousness, assuming that Seal combined with Judgement of Righteousness provides 40% of your threat (Which is a reasonable estimate on a single target), would be worth 6%, so would be a wee little bit better than one-handed weapon specialization, but only on a single target.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, you pretty much have to spend 10 talent points to get access to Improved Seal of Righteousness, versus the 5 talent points needed for one-handed weapon specialization. So the cost for getting Improved Seal of Righteousness is higher.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">There's definitely situations I can see that build being powerful. I'm pretty sure that if you don't need to aggro up to three adds solidly at any point in your tanking career, you'll be getting more threat out of Sanctity Aura; and that for a lower mana cost as well. For raiding in particular Avenger's Shield isn't really needed outside of a very few fights in-game; I'd hate to be without it for tanking at Shade of Akama for example, though I'm certain I could manage without with some effort.<br>
<br>
The downside really is in the fact that you lose Ardent Defender and Reckoning; Ardent Defender is most likely not worth speccing for if you can only put 2 points in it. I was thinking in this direction myself: <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?talent=sZVhxIh0dMgoxVfx0bcz" target="_blank">Talent Calculator - World of Warcraft</a> (If you take out the points in Ret, get Avenger's Shield, and put the 'basic 20' in Holy you'll get the build I'm probably taking next patch)<br>
<br>
From a pure threat point of view in any situation this build is going to be pretty strong. It'll actually sport ~19% more damage (and thus threat) on practically everything you'll face while raiding. I'd say it's also got good survivability in a single hard-hitting target situation. It'll be less good than a build with Ardent Defender at taking damage in a situation with a lot of smaller faster attacks though, and it also lacks Reckoning which is a nice threat boost in a situation in which you're tanking a lot of mobs and are also expected to outaggro single target DPS on a specific mob.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">...you know, I had never actually gone through the parses for exactly how much our warriors block for in "normal" tanking gear. I was basing my numbers off of a comment from our MT about having a "threat" set that gets his Block Value past 700. Since Block Value is a much more important threat-generation stat for Warriors I figured that wasn't much higher than his normal. <br>
<br>
Yet again I stand corrected - I block for 420 in my high-avoidance gear, where our MT blocks for 441.<br>
<br>
So where is all this extra damage coming from? My guess is (on bosses that can crush), the extra crushing blows that sneak through the .5-to-1 second gap where Holy Shield is between cooldown and re-application.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>From going through your parses, it seems like you ate one shear on your first kill. That might make it a bit harder at least.<br>
<br>
On damage taken, your warrior took a maximum of 11561 damage, you a maximum of 10872. He does have 4,7% more avoidance, which may explain why he's easier to heal, but it stops around that. You did not take 1k more damage per hit. Actually, on average hits taken, you had 500 less damage taken compared to him per attack on average.<br>
<br>
So, don't knock yourself for this, it's great to see fellow tankadins achieving stuff like this.</div>

</div>Chicken, I didn't see where anyone responded to you on this, so forgive me if I missed it.  I have been testing on the PTR and have found the Direct Damage portion of SoV to be defined by roughly:<br>
<br>
weapon_speed*10  + (weapon_speed/90)*spell_dmg.<br>
<br>
I spent some time testing various weapons in SMV (to avoid zone buffs) and without 1H spec.<br>
<br>
I posted the numbers I got here:<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304042312/http://www.failsafedesign.com/maintankadin/viewtopic.php?t=3157&amp;start=30" target="_blank">Maintankadin :: View topic - Seal of Vengeance Redux</a><br>
<br>
Just scroll down on page 3 to my table where I posted my results (and what I expected to see via the equation I determined).<br>
<br>
I had 2 weapons (a 1.6 speed and a 3.6 speed) that had no spell dmg and found that the direct damage SoV did was exactly equal to weapon_speed*10 (so a 1.6 speed would do 16, etc.)<br>
<br>
I need to test with weapons of other speeds more, but this is what I have found.<br>
<br>
Also, somewhere before you asked about 1H spec and SoV.  1H spec does increase SoV damage.  I found that out testing a few patches back, so I don't have any hard data, but I can probably come up with some values if you want.  I have a guest over for the week though, so it will probably be a week before I can sit down and test again.</div>

(note that being crush immune via blocks rather than via parry actually deals a bit more threat as well).<br>
<br>
As for the rotation, remember that when redoubt is active you can actually let your holy shield wait for a concentration+judge+reseal. Depending on what portion of your threat is from holy shield blocks this might be a TPS loss, although I highly doubt it after glancing again at the OP's TPS from spell damage values. Figuring out redoubt's uptime to calculate actual TPS is a big problem, but figuring out whether you gain or lose tps by delaying HS when redoubt is active shouldn't be.</div>

	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>A poor choice given that our white damage is a very very small source of threat, and 10% strength when you only have 130ish is a very minuscule amount of block value. Imp SoR is more for Holy Paladins who want to solo farm as holy, not for protection. The 15% bonus occurs on the base damage of the ability, the effect is not calculated with your spell damage, which means it doesn't scale at all with your spell damage/gear level. <br>
<br>
Also, dropping points from parry like you mentioned is definitely not something I would recommend for any tank. Avoidance is a wonderful thing, and while I prefer the consistency of blocks as a tank and as a healer, it's not something you can overlook gaining 1% avoidance for 1 talent point.</div>

</div>Interesting find. To counter this, I've been using a 1.8 speed weapon to tank with since I hit 70, and since they added the extra damage component when a 5 stack is present I've never seen anything higher than maybe 15 on the upper end of non-partial resists unless Crusader is judged. <br>

</div>If you're regularly in MT type situations, sure.<br>
<br>
But when facing a situation where tank mitigation is the overriding concern, most guilds won't be using a paladin tank anyway.  So for a lot of people there are good reasons for skipping the 10+ point sink in Ret entirely (once crushes are no longer an issue, of course).<br>
<br>
Personally I love being able to put Imp. LoH on any of our tanks without sacrificing the mana bar of one of our holy paladins.</div>

</div>I think the only difference is the added base bonus damage (which seems to be weapon_speed*10 so far as I test it).  The spell damage coefficient seems unchanged between live and the PTR.  <br>
<br>
1.1% should be about right.  I use 1/90, which happens to be 1.11111111~%, as that seems to be pretty accurate for the results I have seen.<br>
<br>
And I am indeed testing on the PTR at the moment for those who were asking before, I have just put off testing for the week till my guests leave (I am guessing they don't want to see me hit demons for 2 hours at a time all week while I record data  )</div>

The downside of taking full Ardent Defender now is that it'll basically put you on at least 43 points in Protection, thus prohibiting you from picking up any of the good talents in the other two trees. If that isn't an issue for you though, you should definitely pick it up.</div>

ive seen a few differant ideas on the way to build and for differant purposes, so im stumped for how to play it.<br>

Im intending to be a main tank and have pretty much been tanking away spamming conc and shield reserving wrath for when/if i lose agro on someone. (right def is a pain to use will ahve to try that macro )<br>

<br>
<br>
Im thinking of respeccing to loose Dev aura and gain reckoning as well as shuffling a few points to be more along the lines of other prot builds ive seen, but considering to try for imp retir aura.<br>
<br>
is this wise?  Also could you point me towards any build/gear layouts so i can have a see which would be more suitable for me?</div>

		<div id="post_message_532167">The int talent is pretty much 5 wasted talent points, consider how much extra max mana that really gives you.  There's your 5 points for reckoning right there.  Having said that, why 5/5 Devo Aura?  It's pretty unlikely you'll ever be running it right?  You should be having Retribution Aura running if you're tanking.  So switch those 5 points from Imp Devo Aura into 5/5 1-H Specialization.  Read the tooltip carefully -- it increases ALL damage done while a 1-H weapon is increased.  This is a strict 5% increase in your threat, so you really want to have this.<br>

The points in Ret are fine, although you may want to either drop 2 points in Stoicism or Guardian's Favor to pick up Improved Judgement.<br>

</div>I've seen this elsewhere, and I'm a bit baffled. Is retribution aura really that much worth it over devotion aura when you're talking karazhan and heroic tanking? I realize that as you get in gear progression armor value becomes less and less valuable per point, but early on that +1000 armor value has to be at least worth 1.5% damage mitigation, and that sounds like it's worth more than the threat generated from retribution.<br>
<br>
Or as <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304042312/http://evilempireguild.org/guides/diminishmath.php" target="_blank">this article points out</a>, while you get diminishing returns from armor mitigation in terms of damage prevented, you don't get diminishing returns in terms of your life expectancy as armor increases. I would think that until you're AC capped, more armor is always better.</div>

</div>Agreeing with most of your point, however, I have never run retribution aura in a raid main tank setting. Sure, if you've got a holy paladin running it for you, that's fine. Either way, Improved devotion aura is not worth 5 points. I would have to say the preffered MT build over at maintankadin is:<br>
<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304042312/http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/classes/paladin/talents.html?0000000000000000000005305133500021525215010520500000000000000000" target="_blank">http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/...00000000000000</a><br>
<br>
Come 2.3 it will change somewhat. I imagine the points in reckoning will move to combat expertise, with a little more flavor between kings, spell warding, and the new ret talent changes (pursiot of justice and imp jotc).</div>

		<div id="post_message_532237">Dev aura was just for making damage reductions on low threat groups tbh.<br>
<br>
ive not tanked a heroic yet since most ppl arent interested in either a) pala tanks or b) waiting for threat to gen and attacking immediately <br>
<br>
But yep i rarely use dev aura when im in a competant group taht can cause some real threat.<br>
<br>
<br>
I like the look of that build   was concerned i was wasting the 5 points in holy, but now its confirmed im happy <br>
<br>
Also i see your only like 5 points off im pretri aura.<br>
<br>
is it worth dropping precision and spel warding to gain the extra threat gen off retri aura?  or is the 4% spell damage reduction and 3% melle crit worth more than on hit damage of 39 as id presume over a instance/raid id get more damage of the ret aura than the 3% crit would proc if taking mass agro.<br>

As i say im new to tanking so might be a tad slow with concepts </div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">The int talent is pretty much 5 wasted talent points, consider how much extra max mana that really gives you.  There's your 5 points for reckoning right there.  Having said that, why 5/5 Devo Aura?  It's pretty unlikely you'll ever be running it right?  You should be having Retribution Aura running if you're tanking.  So switch those 5 points from Imp Devo Aura into 5/5 1-H Specialization.  Read the tooltip carefully -- it increases ALL damage done while a 1-H weapon is increased.  This is a strict 5% increase in your threat, so you really want to have this.<br>
<br>
The points in Ret are fine, although you may want to either drop 2 points in Stoicism or Guardian's Favor to pick up Improved Judgement.<br>
<br>
My paladin runs with a typical 49/12 cookie cutter spec which works extremely well for 5 mans and Karazhan.   That would be the following build:  <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?talent=sZVhtIx0dggqzVbx" target="_blank">Talent Calculator - World of Warcraft</a></div>

</div>I partially agree.  I personally find points in Guardian's Favor to be a complete waste, it's basically a holy PVP talent.  I find that I do run with devo aura on occasion, mostly in situations where threat generation is far less useful than maxing out stamina/avoidance.  But the imp devo points just aren't worth it, we don't have enough spare points to go around as it stands.  Ask for a holy pally to be stuck in your group instead (if there's one to spare), as they're fairly likely to have that talent (good for MT group, arena, etc).<br>
<br>
Stoicism seems to have little worth for PVE tanking, again seems like a PVP talent (it's rare for mobs to dispel your spells).  Spell Warding is very useful to have though, as nearly every boss mob in the game does some sort of spell damage.<br>
<br>
Reckoning and 1-handed spec are really useful threat generators.  Reckoning is much more useful for MTing something than OTing (in the sense of both tanks being on the same mob, not off-tanking a separate mob), as it won't proc unless you're getting wailed on.  1-handed spec is just about mandatory though, 5% is a huge threat bonus.<br>
<br>
I haven't had too many occasions where I missed precision, and honestly I liked having some points in intellect, although I will be removing them for 2.3.  Any "free" mana I can get helps a lot with the mana pot consumption.<br>
<br>
As far as the actual tanking goes, read the basic guildlines in the first post of this thread.  It sums up pally tanking pretty nicely in about 6 bullet points .</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I've seen this elsewhere, and I'm a bit baffled. Is retribution aura really that much worth it over devotion aura when you're talking karazhan and heroic tanking? I realize that as you get in gear progression armor value becomes less and less valuable per point, but early on that +1000 armor value has to be at least worth 1.5% damage mitigation, and that sounds like it's worth more than the threat generated from retribution.</div>

</div>For that level of tanking, I think Ret aura is far better, threat is much more of a concern.   I haven't tanked anything in a 25 man raid, but I imagine I'd be running Devo there -- but Imp Devo still seems like a waste of points.  That's for others to answer though, at his level though I don't think it's a concern.<br>
<br>
I guess in a broader sense it really depends on threat vs survivabilty in Karazhan.  There's some fights where threat isn't a concern at all and survivabilty certainly is, and then absolutely I'd be running Devo there.  I dont think I've ever run Devo in a heroic though.</div>

		<div id="post_message_532256">Ret aura is pretty huge for threat, but it really depends on multiple factors which to run, the most obvious being that if you have a holy paladin in your group they most likely have 5/5 devo so you can just have them run that while you run ret aura. <br>
<br>
It really depends if your trying to get max threat or max mitigation.<br>
<br>
Ret aura is huge for threat though, assuming 2.0 attack speed Ret aura is 26 damage per attack, so 13 holy damage a second or (1.9 x 13) 24.7 TPS on each attacker assuming no 1h spec.  Just to compare, scant aura which is awesome, only adds @ 25 TPS to my standard cycle (consecrate, SoR, HS, Judge) yet people spend 21 points into ret to get it.<br>
<br>
Your mileage may vary but ret aura is pretty damn good in general, if you are in a situation where you can get devo elsewhere, or can do not need max mitigation (trash, ae, etc).</div>

		<div id="post_message_532287">I'm not saying that you should spec imp dev aura; that's clearly the wrong choice because of shield spec. <br>
<br>
Ret aura is great when fighting adds or multiple mobs, but on bosses you're talking at best around 24.7 TPS from it. That sounds a bit high to me, honestly (I don't think most bosses hit at 2.0 speed), but let's go with that. The TPS from kara-equipped people in this thread appears to be around 500, so we're talking another 5% extra threat from ret aura. That's again, at best - no misses, no dodges. (Do parries count for ret aura hits? I didn't think so, but I could be wrong). <br>
<br>
Whereas devotion aura improves survivability (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304042312/http://evilempireguild.org/guides/acstamina.php" target="_blank">according to that calculation above</a>) by a fair amount too. According to the solved problems there, 1 stamina is equivalent to 25 AC. That means devotion aura at base provides +34 effective stamina, and 51 stamina with improved. That goes down as you improve your HP, but at kara/heroic levels, that's about right.</div>

		<div id="post_message_532336">Actually the more HP you have, the more effective HP you get from armor. Actually the amount of effective HP you get is dependant ONLY on your HPs. The amount of armor you have has no effect on how much effective HP you will get from adding more armor. The relative effect of adding armor goes down as you add more armor, but so does every other stat (the relative effect of +1 stam is different when you have 10,000 HP VS 15,000, same as armor, spell damage and almost any other stat,).<br>
Exception would be avoidance, where more avoidance actually gives more relative benefit (50% avoidance when you have 0% is infinitely worse than +50% avoidance when you already have 50%, to give an extreme example). Avoidance though causes inconsistency in damage taken and doesn't stop you from dying to a bust, which is why stamina/armor stacking is prefered. But it actually has increasing benefits the more avoidance you have in terms of how much longer can the healers last.</div>

If threat is an issue, I guess ret is the way to go, but I've seen more pally tanks sta-limited, not threat-limited, especially early on in their gear.</div>

</div>My problem is our tank group looks like Feral/Warrior/Me/Lock/Tree.  Our feral is our third tank and main assist and thus we never have room in group 1 for a devotion paladin.  I run ret aura almost all of the time in raids except in situations where I'm going to be tanking something for a long time and reducing incoming damage is more important than threat.  I sit around 15.6k armor or so in raids.</div>

Partial resists would be a different can of worms than spell/melee hit.  SoC and JoC can both be partially resisted, but one uses melee hit while the other uses spell hit.  <br>
<br>
That's a good question though - Does JoB have partial resists?  If not, that sounds like the ability skips the resist check, much like debuff judgements.  <br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">It's currently hard to say how good (or bad) expertise is; it's clearly the worst of the three from a threat point of view, but getting one of your attacks parried reduces the time until the next attack of the mob you were attacking, turning expertise into the only one of the three that affects your survivability; expertise is worth roughly 0.9% damage reduction per point of expertise.<br>
<br>
Ratings needed for 1% hit with each different rating:<br>
15.8 hit rating = 1% hit<br>
12.6 spellhit rating = 1% spellhit<br>
7.8 expertise rating = 0.5% less dodges, 0.5% less parries</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>You said that it's clearly the worst of the three? Let's take another look at that. An attack which is avoided cannot trigger SoR, so it offers almost the same benefits as +hit at half the rating cost (and approx. the same threat benefits if you're behind the target or in front going past the -dodge cap).<br>
<br>
Let's say you have a paladin with 3/3 Precision and 5/5 Combat Expertise, with no ratings from gear, against a boss with standard 5/5/10 M/D/P. That gives us this attack table:<br>
6.00% Miss<br>
8.75% Parry<br>
3.75% Dodge<br>
81.50% Hit / Crit / Glance (SoR procs regardless)<br>
<br>
We approximate crits and glances cancelling each other out; this is probably not accurate, but as white damage is a small component anyway, it shouldn't be problematic. 20 hit rating will reduce chance to be missed by 1.27%, increasing SoR/melee/AS damage by ~1.6%. 20 expertise rating reduces chance to parry/dodge by 2.56% total, and thus increases SoR/melee damage by 3.1%. Take spells at 14% to be resisted, and 20 spell hit rating would increase your chance to hit with spells by 1.59%. This increases your threat from resistible abilities by 1.8%.<br>
<br>
Now, based on some of my own WWS data on lone bosses, <b>roughly</b>:<br>
45% of threat is affected by Spell Hit<br>
35% of threat is affected by Hit<br>
30% of threat is affected by Expertise<br>
<br>
So,<br>
20 Spell Hit Rating increases your TPS by about 0.83%<br>
20 Hit Rating increases your TPS by about 0.56%<br>
20 Expertise Rating increases your TPS by about 0.94%</div>

		<div id="post_message_535654">That's actually a good point, I just looked at it from a "1% of this provides a certain benefit" in which I didn't take into account the fact that the rating cost is a lot lower on expertise, which makes it significantly better than the other two.<br>
<br>
I'll fix that up. Thanks.<br>

Edit:<br>
<br>
There we go, rewrote that part to mention that from a sustained TPS point of view Expertise is superior to the other two hit boosting stats, but the other two hit boosting stats are a bit better from a burst threat point of view. Also included a link to your post PsiVen, thanks again.</div>

</div>Maybe I'm just being dumb here, but other than AS I don't see what +hit affects that +expertise doesn't.  Clue me in?<br>
<br>
(and if AS is 5% of your threat on a typical boss fight, I'm clearly doing it wrong.)<br>
<br>
edit: according to the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080222044554/http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/patchnotes/test-realm-patchnotes.html" target="_blank">PTR notes</a> warrior and druid taunt is now on melee hit.  We'll have to see if that means a base 17% miss rate with 1% guaranteed resists (as with spells) or if it means a 9% base miss rate that can go to 0% (as with melee).<br>
<br>
Either way, we just went from having the most reliable taunt (due to the moderate spell hit that we normally carry) to having the least reliable taunt.  <br>
<br>
If the PTR taunt for warriors and druids is on the melee system, then most of their taunts will now be totally unresistable with pretty minimal effort gearwise.  With expertise rating affecting virtually everything else that they do-- but not everything that we do--  I can't help but think that our single-target threat is going to lag substantially behind our brother tanks.<br>
<br>
I'm glad that tank threat levels are going up overall, but I kind of feel like our dual dependence on spell hit and melee hit is going to leave prot paladins out in the cold for single-target threat this patch.<br>
<br>
edit edit: I totally missed that RD is also on melee hit now.  Guess we wait and see what the resist rates are on the Brand New Tauntness.</div>

<br>
AS actually is about 5% of my threat when it's a fight where I can weave it in like VR. But yeah, it's rough.<br>
<br>
I'm concerned about our single-target threat in 2.3 as well; it seems like warriors and druids are getting a big buff with Expertise while we really never used weapon skill or hit in the first place. Hopefully there will be some synergy worked out between hit ratings for us.<br>
<br>

</div>The question would be if its still considered a spell or melee effect after this change aswell. Since spells always have 1% to get resisted. (I know, its just 1%, but something worth noting)</div>

		<div id="post_message_536004">Well, relative to a well geared warrior or druid our taunt will be less effective, but relative to now it'll still be more effective for us than it was before. It's about 7% less chance for taunt to be resisted (With the difference being largely affected by your gear).<br>
<br>
I'd venture a hopeful guess and say that effectively makes normal +hit the best choice for us in case of quickly spawning adds with both Avenger's Shield and Righteous Defense now being affected by it. Doubly so for Blood Elf Paladins since if you really want to cement initial threat you just use a quick Judgement of Blood.<br>
<br>
It's certainly worth testing, and rather makes me happy I happen to have a few items with hit rating on them; if I wear all three of those I actually have 63 hit rating (The third item, not currently equipped being a <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34010"><span><span class="purplename">[Pepe's Shroud of Pacification]</span></span></a>). That should put me at about 2% taunt resist chance with Precision, quite an improvement over my current 15.3% chance of a resist (On a boss that is).<br>
<br>
Personally I'd enjoy it if Holy Shield were changed to melee hit too, and possibly Judgement of Righteousness as well; that'd also be a smooth buff to our single target threat unless you have really high amounts of spell hit. Note that with being affected by melee hit I do mean effectively that they are treated as ranged attacks are; no parries or dodges.</div>

</div>If they're going to do that, they might as well do a complete mechanic overhaul to put every paladin ability on the same scaling system then.  (ie; HoJ, Repent, Holy Shock, all damage judgements)  At the same time, they'd need to do an itemization overhaul.  <br>

Technically speaking part of the Expertise Rating on those bracers is because of that "wasted" (It'd provide an equal benefit at any rating in between 20 and 23). That also means that the benefit is a bit lower than flatly calculating the reduction as Expertise Rating / Conversion number.<br>

To actually calculate the benefit you get from expertise rating is a matter of dividing the amount of rating by 3.9, removing any decimals, and then multiplying by 0.25</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Ret aura is pretty huge for threat, but it really depends on multiple factors which to run, the most obvious being that if you have a holy paladin in your group they most likely have 5/5 devo so you can just have them run that while you run ret aura. <br>
<br>
It really depends if your trying to get max threat or max mitigation.<br>
<br>
Ret aura is huge for threat though, assuming 2.0 attack speed Ret aura is 26 damage per attack, so 13 holy damage a second or (1.9 x 13) 24.7 TPS on each attacker assuming no 1h spec.  Just to compare, scant aura which is awesome, only adds @ 25 TPS to my standard cycle (consecrate, SoR, HS, Judge) yet people spend 21 points into ret to get it.<br>
<br>
Your mileage may vary but ret aura is pretty damn good in general, if you are in a situation where you can get devo elsewhere, or can do not need max mitigation (trash, ae, etc).</div>

</div>Ret aura is only useful prior to obtaining gear to become uncrushable or when fighting enough mobs that HS charges get used before it can be refreshed. When single target tanking boss mobs ret aura provides zero extra threat since it doesn't proc off of blocks. So since a MT pallys hit table only contains miss/dodge/parry/block it will never proc. Also it's returns when fighting multiple mobs are also diminished since between HS being up, Redoubt procs, and the pallys normal 30%+ avoidance/block ret aura won't be proccing as often as you would think. In end-game raid tanking the aura hierarchy is Sant(From a ret pally hopefully)&gt;devo(from you or another pally)&gt;imp Conc(Silence kills pallys)&gt;ret IMO.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Ret aura is only useful prior to obtaining gear to become uncrushable or when fighting enough mobs that HS charges get used before it can be refreshed. When single target tanking boss mobs ret aura provides zero extra threat since it doesn't proc off of blocks. So since a MT pallys hit table only contains miss/dodge/parry/block it will never proc.</div>

</div>What?  That's not true at all.  Take a look at this one little snippet from my Paladin tanking Moroes last night.  There's plenty of blocks in there, and you can see the Retribution Aura damage every time there's a Greater Blessing of Sanctuary damage.<br>

</div>You're right it looks like it did proc off a block. I know I read somewhere else that it doesn't proc off blocks and even went outside and fought some of the mobs outside shat with only ret aura up and it didn't proc once. Anyone have any idea why it wouldn't have procced on the mobs outside shat? (It was proccing on regular hits but everytime I blocked I was only getting the HS damage.)<br>

EDIT: Just tested it again and again it wasn't proccing. Here's my combat log:<br>

</div>I haven't heard of anyone actually trying it, I think the general assumption was that the mana burn damage would get too high; the actual mana being burned shouldn't be an issue (As with a warrior tank, that would be a predictable damage spike your healers should work around, so your Prot Paladin should near instantly have some mana to work with again after it hits). The reason the mana burn would be too high compared to a warrior is that a Prot Paladin is less efficient at dumping large amounts of their mana than a warrior is at dumping large amounts of rage (Basically, the same reason you don't hear of many feral druids tanking him either). Edit: And of course you'll already be using at least a Prot Warrior to tank for phase 2, which is another reason why you rarely hear of any other classes tanking phase 3.<br>
<br>
I'd love to hear if it works out, because there's certainly some advantages to using a Prot Paladin for that phase of the fight.</div>

</div>Heh, I popped in this thread mostly for noticing your name. <br>
<br>
Sort of on topic, it's the equal stat weight that is one of the robust features of the rating system.  Often I see people suggest that all ratings convert to a percentage with the same conversion, but this would force Blizzard to give each rating a different item point weight (well, as long as they stubbornly hold on to their item point allocation system, anyway).</div>

Also the talent "Weapon Expertise" I notice that no one actually has it, but with weapon skill being converted to Expertise in 2.3 is this still going to be a skipped talent?

		<div id="post_message_538935">Yes, 0/49/12 is the "cookie-cutter" build -- you can't really go wrong with it.  Right now Weapon Expertise is a really worthless talent -- I actually haven't studied the 2.3 talent trees that much yet so I can't comment on 2.3 builds.<br>
<br>
As for tanking, the aura you run is a judgement call by you.  Basically it comes down to survivability vs threat.  Use the aura that helps your weaker point.  Generally for me, I run Retribution Aura in 5 mans and heroics -- I'm usually tanking multiple mobs and want as much threat as possible.  For harder hitting bosses in Kara, I'll switch to Devotion Aura.  (after all you can pop Avenging Wrath to front load a lot of threat in boss fights)  Generally when I run heroics though I run with Retribution Aura since I'm running with very good groups -- so healing isn't an issue, but putting out as much threat as possible is.  That just illustrates how it's a judgement call.  If you were running it with a bunch of people in blues, then maybe threat isn't an issue at all and you'd want to run Devo instead to help the healer out a little bit.</div>

		<div id="post_message_539271">Weapon Expertise definitely will not be skipped next patch. Not only is expertise very good, it's also 10% extra stamina. I'd say any paladin that seriously wants to tank and skips Weapon Expertise isn't thinking properly.<br>
<br>
I'd expect something like this to become the new "cookie-cutter" build really: <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?talent=sZVhtIx0dMgqtVbx" target="_blank">Talent Calculator - World of Warcraft</a><br>
<br>
Basically it means trading Reckoning for Weapon Expertise. It's a mild loss in threat, but the 10% extra stamina is easily worth it, as are the lower amount of parries (Both from losing reckoning and from expertise). The threat loss isn't as large as it might appear at first sight as well, both expertise and reckoning will improve your auto-attack + seal threat.<br>
<br>
Another variation possible on the above build if you really do want Reckoning is dropping Anticipation for Reckoning; but that requires at least a certain level of gear since Anticipation is a fairly good contribution to both crit (0.8%) and crush immunity (3.2%).</div>

It'd be interesting to dip back into reckoning after suitable gear (presumably post-Kara). That would make a good farmer and a good raider build, since the defense isn't going to be so important for aoe farming.<br>
<br>
I believe we figured out that (roughly) each point of expertise is about .4% improvement in threat, right? Reckoning is slightly less than a 5% improvement in threat, so the overall loss isn't as great, and you get an increased amount of HP from the lack of parries.</div>

My raid group and I have been working on the Kaelthas encounter, and I've been given the pleasure of tanking 3 weapons.  The last two nights I've been putting JoW on them, and refreshing the judgements on all them by cycling between them, without problem.  Then last night we had a slight change of set up (more melee) and I thought it'd be useful to put JoL on one and JoW on another, and suddenly the judgements wouldn't refresh.<br>

Has anyone else tried keeping multiple different judgements up when multi-mob tanking?<br>

I've kept JoC or JoW up, with SotC, on 3 weapons at once without problem, but as soon as I try to mix judgements they don't appear to refresh on melee hits.<br>

And confirmation of this problem?  Or reports of people doing this successfully (on Kael weapons or other mobs).<br>

</div>Spell Warding versus PoJ is semi-interesting. PoJ's speed boost would be the primary contributing factor here, since I'm pretty sure that Spell Warding works out better on an overall damage taken reduction perspective. And 15% extra movement speed is pretty good in case you need to run after or away from something to survive. One thing is it's a 2 point talent versus a 3 point talent, so you'd have to scrounge a talent point from somewhere else too, though PoJ already becomes better than a boot speed enchant at 2 points.<br>
<br>
Improved JotC would mostly just give your raid group 3% extra crit; not to be sneezed at I suppose if you're keeping up JotC anyway. But not really a large boost to your own performance any more since it'll no longer improve the holy damage component of the Judgement.<br>

</div>The mechanics of judgement "refreshing" are actually rather strange in general. You don't actually refresh the judgement as such, instead meleeing when a judgement is up will simply apply a totally new judgement instead (You can see this in effect on mobs that reflect spells, you'll end up putting a judgement on yourself).<br>
<br>
Some other conjecture, especially based around the fact that the judgement melee refresh window was only 10 seconds before patch 2.1, leads me to belief that casting or refreshing a debuff judgement basically applies an invisible buff to you with a 20 second duration (Also refreshed by the Crusader Strike effect). This buff has the effect of causing you to refresh whichever debuff judgement you cast last, as long as you "own" the judgement. Because of that, you also can't keep up different types of judgements at the same time, but can put up an amount of judgements of the same type theoretically equal to the amount of hits you can do in a 20 second period.</div>

</div>That's something worth testing actually. I'll see if I can make some time to log on the PTR and try this out. If anyone else wants to try it out, <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?npc=22180" target="_blank">Shard-Hide Boars</a> make perfect test subjects for trying out spell reflect mechanics.<br>
<br>
It's not really a major concern though, I can't really think of a raid boss currently in-game that reflects spells. There's a fair few 5-man bosses that do so, and a few trash mobs however.</div>

</div>In theory, it could (whether it does is subject to testing). However, in practice as long as you remain uncrushable in a boss fight you should remain uncrittable as well. So even if you got it reflected onto you in a boss fight you could still push off the 3% crit chance with block.<br>

It seems that it would matter more for trash, where Holy Shield charges are likely to get used up and Redoubt might not be up.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">In theory, it could (whether it does is subject to testing). However, in practice as long as you remain uncrushable in a boss fight you should remain uncrittable as well. So even if you got it reflected onto you in a boss fight you could still push off the 3% crit chance with block.<br>

</div>Yes.  I was tanking for Heroic Slave Pens run, and had judged Sanct. Crusader (+3% crit JotC) on one of the spell reflecting mobs.  <br>
<br>
<br>
I took a crit and died.  Bewildered, I checked my defense tab and noted that I was over 490 Defense and should have been uncrittable.    Then it dawned on me that JotC had been spell-reflected ...<br>
<br>
<br>
If you pick up the 2.3 iJotC, you might want to stick to JoW for spell reflecting mobs if you use debuff judgements at all.  (Unless you're over-geared and exceedingly bored)</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Spell Warding versus PoJ is semi-interesting. PoJ's speed boost would be the primary contributing factor here, since I'm pretty sure that Spell Warding works out better on an overall damage taken reduction perspective. And 15% extra movement speed is pretty good in case you need to run after or away from something to survive. One thing is it's a 2 point talent versus a 3 point talent, so you'd have to scrounge a talent point from somewhere else too, though PoJ already becomes better than a boot speed enchant at 2 points.</div>

	</tbody></table>
</div>Right. I just think you're going to see people take the ability because they like running faster as a matter of course. It might not be as good for certain encounters as spell warding, but I suspect you'll see it anyway. Honestly, I'll likely go this way because running fast is more fun for me.<br>

</div>No, it's not a good boost to your performance given the non-reliance on crits for paladin tanks. But a 3% raid crit is fairly large. I suspect it strongly depends on the makeup of the group in question. Some are going to be more mana-based, and those groups will still want JoW. Others will really want a 3% damage boost because they're not mana-limited.

</div>Personally, I think it'll be a big personal performance boost because I'll be justified in using it.  Till 2.3, judging crusader really only helped me, and maybe one other pally (/hammers toward the end), while wisdom helped nearly everyone but our couple of rogues and warriors.  Now, with very little effort talent point wise, I can keep crusader up, while giving the entire raid a +3% crit rate. Basically - booyah!  Unless we get a ret pally, in which case I can spend those precious points elsewhere, and beg to have him stuck in my tanking group for the massive threat boost.</div>

For the 2nd option, I think a decent method would be two paladins, one geared with maxed +spell hit, one geared with max +melee hit, chain taunting off each other.

1 block rating = 1.88 defense rating = 2.38 dodge rating = 2.82 parry rating = 2.86 agility (kings) = 3.15 agility (no kings)<br>
<br>
That'll let a player easily compare gear in terms of how close it'll get him to uncrushable just by adding up the numbers:<br>
<br>
block rating equivalence (BRE) = block rating + defense rating / 1.88 + dodge rating / 2.38 + parry rating / 2.82 + agility / 2.86<br>
<br>
For example, <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30641"><span><span class="purplename">[Boots of Elusion]</span></span></a> would have a BRE of 28.2 and <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30033"><span><span class="purplename">[Boots of the Protector]</span></span></a> would have 30.8, so you could safely upgrade without worrying about losing uncrushability.<br>
<br>
It might also be helpful to emphasize that paladins, unlike warriors, are better off stacking defense over dodge for quite awhile, though dodge becomes better than defense for additional avoidance after uncrushability is reached.</div>

</div>You really only need to drop Anticipation for Reckoning actually; it's just not immediately obvious when speccing from the spec I linked. For example: <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?talent=sZVhtI00dggqtVbx" target="_blank">Talent Calculator - World of Warcraft</a><br>
<br>
It will force you into taking kings though, not that that's necessarily a bad thing. If you prefer you can just put the single point in Anticipation instead.<br>

Our chance of parry gibfest also isn't that bad (Reckoning sounds worse than it is; double attacks for a while still doesn't compare to basically trying to use an instant parryable attack every 1.5 seconds in addition to auto-attacks), though it is the case next patch that it's likely that while Warriors and Druids have some expertise, it's harder to come by in our gear unless you pick up some special pieces for it (Generally speaking our itemization comes with spell damage where theirs would give expertise, in the case of the pieces that give expertise).</div>

</div>I think his point (and mine) was that you can either have reckoning or you can have anticipation. If you don't do either anticipation or reckoning you won't have enough points to go into the tree any further. You need at least 2 points in one or the other.<br>

</div>Well, in terms of tanking I agree with you, but when it comes to solo/grinding I will say that Reckoning is far and away more important than 1hws.

		<div id="post_message_542800">Heya, was just hoping you guys could give me some advice on how you tank the murlocs at tidewalker.<br>
<br>
I've done it as holy (in my previous guild) like this:<br>
-tank gear on<br>
-after quake, I'd heal up the raid (other healers only heal me and MT at this time) with RF to get aggro<br>
-once murlocs came, I'd continue healing, having a designated healer on me to keep me up, while warlocks seeded the murlocs (as many as they can)<br>
-mages would cast flamestrike simultaneously, making the seeds go off - at this point I'd loose aggro and the murlocs would be kited by the warlocks / mages till death (not long)<br>
<br>
<br>
Now I'm in a new guild and am prot, the second in the tank lineup. I plan to do the same to get aggro (heal the raid after the quake), then consecrate and holy shield to keep them on me, after a while the locks and mages would aoe (hopefully with me having enough aggro to keep them on me).<br>
<br>
Any suggestions / hints?<br>
<br>
Oh and is it possible to macro divine shield so you use it and cancle it with 1 macro? Tried but couldn't get it right (could be very usefull if I get graved).</div>

		<div id="post_message_542821">I usually tank the murlocs on the south side of morogrim while a warrior picks them up north. We have a shadowpriest with VE on moro that gets the murlocs aggrod onto him. This makes it easier to lay down traps and conc to pick them up. It's basicly me standing just behind a hunter trap laying down conc and I got 2 mages and a warlock usually to kill them. No real problems with aggro, I don't heal up anything before they come at all. Warrior tries to do the same on the north side but he's got a harder time ofcourse. We don't make 1 big camp because it's harder to get all the mobs and aggro on all of them if either south or north murlocs join in later. But hunter frost traps and frost nova from mages are your friend to pick up a pack of murlocs. I usually got 1 or 2 going for a warlock/mage and can easily taunt them off.

</div>Not really, getting uncrushable and keeping a decent amount of stamina at start is not an easy task (or I dont remember it to be anyway). The stamina part will be easier in 2.3 though.<br>
<br>
Thing is, in Kara there are quite a few bosses where those extra parries can make alot of difference when you'r learning it. Maiden and Prince are good examples of this. (and who knows, maybe even nightbane with the 2.3 fear changes)</div>

Thing is, in Kara there are quite a few bosses where those extra parries can make alot of difference when you'r learning it. Maiden and Prince are good examples of this. (and who knows, maybe even nightbane with the 2.3 fear changes)</div>

<br>
I'd only ever recommend dropping Anticipation if you really do not feel you need it; it's even not a bad avoidance talent if you don't feel you need any other talent. And simply put, it's 3.2% less chance to be crushed, and also covers 0.8% of your crit immunity, both of which you'll likely need if you're not in tier 5+ raid gear.</div>

		<div id="post_message_543009">Personally, I do not feel at ANY given point is it wise to drop anticipation. It is worth 3.2% crush avoidance and counts towards the anti-crit cap, something that can actually be tough with T5/ZA level gear when you are gearing for max stamina.<br>
<br>
If you are speccing for an MT role, your soloing is crappy either way. Don't gimp your raid for what you do off-time. Its time for reckoning to be dropped.<br>

<br>
I've done it as holy (in my previous guild) like this:<br>
-tank gear on<br>
-after quake, I'd heal up the raid (other healers only heal me and MT at this time) with RF to get aggro<br>
-once murlocs came, I'd continue healing, having a designated healer on me to keep me up, while warlocks seeded the murlocs (as many as they can)<br>
-mages would cast flamestrike simultaneously, making the seeds go off - at this point I'd loose aggro and the murlocs would be kited by the warlocks / mages till death (not long)<br>
<br>
<br>
Now I'm in a new guild and am prot, the second in the tank lineup. I plan to do the same to get aggro (heal the raid after the quake), then consecrate and holy shield to keep them on me, after a while the locks and mages would aoe (hopefully with me having enough aggro to keep them on me).<br>
<br>

</div>depends on your threat generation, i have 410 spell damage and maintain about 1000 tps on aoe targets so warlocks and mages cannot take the threat away from me, generaly i call the aoe about 4-6 seconds worth of concencrations after they get to me. argent defender is great for getting stragglers, and try to get a shadow priest in your group you will need the mana if you are using your spells right, cast heals till they get to you, and remeber having concencrate  up is more important than anything else. then shield block, and on aoe mobs i use JOW and SOW cause mana regen in melee actualy causes a good deal of threat.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>That's blatant misinformation. Reckoning has a 10% chance to proc whenever you take damage; including damage taken by spells and <b>partial</b> blocks. It can not block on <b>full</b> blocks, misses, dodges, or parries, let's say 55% of your incoming attacks will be partial blocks, and thus Reckoning will still proc and provide a threat boost.<br>
<br>
I'm 100% certain it works like this, because I've seen Reckoning proc when tanking things which do not use up Holy Shield... And I've tried out the other side of when it doesn't proc by pulling approximately half Ragefire Chasm in a heavy avoidance setup, meaning that none of the mobs were capable of hitting me at all, and in that situation I had no Reckoning procs.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Personally, I think the first post is a good place to have condensed information in an easy to understand format, and include the nitty-grity math in posts later in the thread.  That way someone just looking for a quick answer could scan the first post, while someone looking for the applicable math could do a search in the thread.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">That's blatant misinformation. Reckoning has a 10% chance to proc whenever you take damage; including damage taken by spells and <b>partial</b> blocks. It can not block on <b>full</b> blocks, misses, dodges, or parries, let's say 55% of your incoming attacks will be partial blocks, and thus Reckoning will still proc and provide a threat boost.<br>
<br>
I'm 100% certain it works like this, because I've seen Reckoning proc when tanking things which do not use up Holy Shield... And I've tried out the other side of when it doesn't proc by pulling approximately half Ragefire Chasm in a heavy avoidance setup, meaning that none of the mobs were capable of hitting me at all, and in that situation I had no Reckoning procs.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Personally, I think the first post is a good place to have condensed information in an easy to understand format, and include the nitty-grity math in posts later in the thread.  That way someone just looking for a quick answer could scan the first post, while someone looking for the applicable math could do a search in the thread.<br>
<br>
That decision is up to Chicken though, as he's the one doing the main post.</div>

</div>I don't really care if the math is in the first post or not, but it needs to be somewhere and linked from the first post once the talent section is in place. No one has ever done anything but write down a mildly convincing guess with made up numbers that 1-hand spec is better (in either of the paladin tanking threads). <br>
<br>
In the few minutes I've spent with my own WWS parses I did not come to the same cut and dry conclusion. My own parses have a high enough reckoning contribution (Both across the entire dungeon and against single bosses) that it was coming out equal to or ahead of 1-hand spec. It is completely possible I'm just seeing a string of WWS parses with higher than average reckoning uptime or lower than average Consecration/JoR contribution, or that the selection of bosses I see is too small, but I've seen enough WWS parses that don't favor 1-hand spec that I would really like to see a solid post proving I'm just an outlier before we push the 1-hand spec agenda more. A bunch of WWS parses from paladins at all levels of progression would probably be even better, since reckoning's value is so encounter driven.<br>
<br>
In the other thread we basically had a little napkin math and ran with it and we've come to accept it as 'the way things are', and I'm not convinced we've come to nearly as definitive of a conclusion as we like to think.<br>

		<div id="post_message_544212"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->For Hyjal Prot Paladins are an excellent addition; you're close to trivializing the trash waves. Hyjal bosses we're alright on too; two of the bosses regularly spawn demon adds, though one of those also does AoE silences a lot which is a pain. On Anetheron it's easier relative to other tanks to grab the infernals, and I'm pretty sure that in serious "Oh damn sleep" situations you can bubble out of it, which is an advantage neither druids nor warriors have. It's quite likely by the by that as long as you have good Prot gear you'll still be a good enough tank on the trash even if you're not specced Prot.<br>
<br>
We're less valuable as Prot Paladins specifically compared to other tanks in BT though (That is to say, our unique advantages aren't really anything you'll need to take advantage of in BT; Prot Paladins are still viable for tanking near everything in the instance), but if your guild has enough other tanks a Prot Paladin isn't something they'll miss. BT also features a fair number of more healing intensive fights in which it's harder for your healing paladins to keep up judgements, which makes a Ret Paladin rather nice in there. The only fight in BT in which I can say a Prot Paladin is better than other tanks is on Shade of Akama; however that fight is trivial enough for it not to matter, and some careful planning by your mages or other forms of CC can easily make up for things.<br>
<br>
I'd say my personal verdict, if your guild is cool with that and has at least four other tanks, is that you'd be more useful overall as Ret.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_544460"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hey all,<br>
<br>
First off, thanks to the OP for starting an excellent, and much appreciated thread. I don't have much to add to what's already been said, so instead I'll just offer a couple of small tanking addons. I wrote these some time ago for my own use, but figured I'd upload them to Curse for anyone else who might find them helpful.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080411144357/http://www.curse.com/downloads/details/9961/" target="_blank">TankTotals</a> was written because I wanted a clean, minimal display of the most important "hidden" tanking stats. It basically consists of a transparent window indicating your overall avoidance, mitigation, total block value, and crush immunity status. The main benefits of this addon versus the macros included in the first post are  that:<br>
<ul><li>the values of each change dynamically as new buffs are applied / gear is swapped</li>
<li>it can be set to show figures appropriate to standard level 70 enemies or Boss mobs - in the latter case, for instance, crush immunity is indicated by a 100% rating rather than 102.4%</li>
<li>it sums and displays your total block value, including that from gear, strength and talents</li>
<li>it warns when your crush immunity drops, for instance when Holy Shield fades, by changing the color of the "Crushing" stat from green to red</li>
</ul>Here's a screenshot of the TankTotals window:<br>
<br>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080411144357im_/http://img229.imageshack.us/img229/7389/tanktotalsge0ls5.jpg" border="0" alt=""><br>
<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080411144357/http://www.curse.com/downloads/details/9962/" target="_blank">BoP-B-Gone</a>, as the name implies, automatically removes BoP as well as any buff that either masks (DS, DP) or reduces (BoS, GBoS) your threat. It also allows you to specify a delay before these buffs are removed - so if you're absolutely certain that you can afford to give yourself, say, 1.5 seconds of immunity in a fight, you can. It essentially provides the same function as the Divine Shield macro in the original post, but also means you don't have to worry about removing Salvation or getting BoPed in the middle of a fight. It can also be toggled on or off at any time with /bbg active.<br>
<br>
As I said, I hope these can be of use to people - they should work fine for warrior and bear tanks as well. Feel free to make suggestions/requests on the comment threads!<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_544797"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Thanks for starting this thread Chicken, as a raiding Pally tank i have learned a lot.<br>
<br>
Q. At the moment i tank with minimal Spell damage, SoB (I'm horde) and a kings defender with mongoose. Next patch ill be ditching reckoning for Combat Expertise which means that i also loose a tone of threat... ( 29% of all my  damage comes from auto attacking + Reckoning Procs). <br>
<br>
To solve this problem I'm going to switch to a spell damage weapon (Merc Glad or the one from ZA) and SoR, but i have a dilemma... I cant decide between 40 Spell Damage or Mongoose. I know 9/10 paladins use a spell damage weapon with 40 spell damage but, is it really that much better? Do i loose too much threat? <br>
<br>
In my eyes Mongoose = 5.2% dodge (kings) and a very minor threat boost and seems to proc constantly with my current (reckoning) build.  I also believe in putting mitigation and avoidance  before threat generation. <br>
<br>
What do you think? Merc Gladiator MH with 40 Spell Damage or Goose? <br>
<br>
And by the way, if you haven't guessed already, I'm new to the forums so sorry if this has been answered before :P<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>In response to this, using the default gear in the spreadsheet, a 0-49-12 "Cookie Cutter" spec, and swapping the points back and forth between Reckoning and 1H Spec, I get 912 TPS for Reckoning and 923 TPS for 1H Spec. I was using a mob of type "Unspecified" and an attack type of "Dual Wield". Pretty much everything else was default (healing per second received, ranks of all abilities, etc).<br>
<br>
This would theoretically be a "best case scenario" for reckoning given top-end gear (DW, non-undead mob), but 1H spec beats it out slightly in that situation. Oddly, however, if I switch to an "unarmed" or "two-handed" mob attack type, total TPS jumps by about 50 and Reckoning starts to edge out 1H spec ever so slightly. That seems suspect to me; why would Reckoning proc more/be better against that sort of mob attack? And why would threat be so much higher?<br>
<br>
This is, of course, a very rough test since I used an arbitrary gear set and the relatively arbitrary default incoming HPS number. But, since we have the spreadsheet tool available, maybe some people could run numbers for their own gear and specs?<br>
<br>
EDIT: Following up, it seems that Holy Shield threat as calculated actually DROPS when a dual wielding mob is selected, as does seal threat from seal of righteousness. It looks like the spreadsheet is expecting you to get hit <i>less</i> when fighting a dual wielder, not more (which isn't making sense to me). Unfortunately, I can't verify or find my own thought process error b/c I'm not sure how to show the hidden sheets where all the threat work is calculated.

</div>Dualwielding mobs are generally assumed to get +19% miss penalty on melee auto-attacks (same as dualwielding rogues/warriors/shaman). WWS also show dualwielding bosses with increased miss rate. So yes, you'll get less hits from dualwielding mobs, even though there will be more attacks per second.

</div>Well, yes, but I assumed that the fact that they were swinging two weapons would make up for this. As in...<br>
<br>
<b>Single Wielding Mob, 1.8 speed</b><br>
(0.95/1.8)*1 weapon = 0.53 hits per second<br>
<br>
<b>Dual Wielding Mob, 1.8 speed</b><br>
(0.76/1.8)*2 weapons = 0.84 hits per second<br>
<br>
Or am I not understanding how the speed variable is applied in the spreadsheet? (Like I said, I'm not sure how to access the formulas so I can't verify the way the math is being applied.)</div>

</div>D'oh! Ok, so I was missing something obvious. The gear in the spreadsheet has a 55% total avoidance rate on it (Miss + Dodge + Parry) prior to adding the additional avoidance from the DW penalty. Thus, the numbers become:<br>
<br>
<b>Single Wielding Mob, 1.8 speed</b><br>
(1 weapon*(1-0.55% total avoidance))/1.8 = 0.25 <i>damaging</i> hits per second<br>
<br>
<b>Dual Wielding Mob, 1.8 speed</b><br>
(2 weapons*(1-0.74% total avoidance))/1.8 = 0.29 <i>damaging</i> hits per second<br>
<br>
That is a lot closer, but still not close enough to explain the dropoff. Presumably, to avoid crushing blows each of those damaging hits is blocked, meaning even with the additional miss rate Holy Shield threat (and Reckoning procs) against a dual wielder should be slightly higher.<br>
<br>
The spreadsheet, on the other hand, shows about a 40% dropoff in Holy Shield threat against a dual wielder; roughly what I would expect if only one of the two weapons was being accounted for:<br>
<br>
<b>Dual Wielding Mob, 1.8 speed, counting 1 weapon only</b><br>
(1 weapon*(1-0.74% total avoidance))/1.8 = 0.14 <i>damaging</i> hits per second<br>
0.14/0.25 = ~56%, or a 44% reduction.<br>
<br>
It looks like a bug to me...</div>

		<div id="post_message_545735">For Hydross add-tanking, get as many craftable NR/FrR pieces as you can get (chest/helm/legs of one school or the other, one of each craftable ring, and one of the craftable necks), and then scour the AH for "protection" greens.  The nice thing about the hydross adds is that they ignore armor, so you can wear cloth/leather/mail if necessary.  Get the violet eye shoulder enchant (+7 all resists) for your shoulders, get a resist enchant for your helm, and if you feel like farming Botanica go there for the chromatic resist cape and get the all-resists enchant on that as well.<br>
<br>
I think my hydross set hits about 220 each in FrR/NR unbuffed, which comes to over 300 with auras and a chromatic flask.  If you don't have a good (i.e., epic) spelldamage weapon, you may have to go with a blinding light flask instead, but that should still leave you in the high 200s for each school.  (I regularly skip the resistance flask these days and it's never a problem.)  Weapon oil and spelldamage food are important as well, of course.<br>
<br>
You can safely ignore defense; although you will take a few crits, stacking that much resistance will reduce the overall incoming damage to a level where they won't make a difference.  Using this setup I have no problem AoE tanking all four adds when necessary, although we usually have the "off" MT pick one up just to make things a little easier.<br>
<br>
As far as picking up the adds, drop a consecrate where one will appear (this should be easy to guess), judge another, and throw your shield at a third.  By the time the shield gets off, the last two elementals will have started moving, most likely towards the same person, and if you're lucky you'll get both with the shield.  If not, taunt or hope that your other OT(s) are on the ball.  Then just consecrate and call for AoE.</div>

</div>I can't answer in detail as I simply didn't have the time to even try and get the food on test, but judging by the spell details it appears to zap everything in 15 yards around you for 20 to 30ish lightning damage every 8 seconds. In other words it'll add 3.25 dps per mob in range (And that amount of TPS as well since we don't get any aggro boosters on non-holy damage).<br>
<br>
In comparison, spell damage food is 23 spell damage, which is 2.875 dps for the highest rank of Consecration, or 5.4625 threat per second.<br>
<br>
So it'll be slightly better DPS, but lower threat than spell damage food.<br>
<br>
No idea about whether it breaks crowd control, and the food might very well work differently than I assume (WoWHead's spell details also has a version of it's proc recorded doing 660 to 770 damage, actually linked to the 8 second interval, but it seems unlikely it'd do that amount; 89.375 DPS from a single food buff per target is excessive).</div>

</div>Personally, I don't care much about the name so long as the idea's useful.  I think it can be useful for comparing talents as well, which'll help answer some of the other questions in the thread.  For example, using the "Crush Avoidance Rating" name, each point of Avoidance is 5.1 CAR and each point of Deflection is 7.9 CAR.  Holy Shield is 237 CAR, but that's pretty much academic .</div>

		<div id="post_message_547076">We've been killing hydross for EXACTLY 3 months now (First kill was 8/13/07) and our add tanks never use resist gear.  We just have 5 tanks for that fight.  The two hydross tanks have maxed out FrR and NR but our add tanks have 0 resistance gear on.  We just go in with our normal tanking gear.  This strategy has worked brilliantly for us and we never have any problems with it.<br>
<br>
We put all 5 tanks into one group.  When the phase change happens, everyone picks up their designated elemental and drags them together.  We have our deep holy priests SPAM Circle of Healing on the tank group and give them a shadow priest.  What ends up happening is that DPS opens up with AOE as soon as the adds are in the middle and we nuke them down FAST.  We have never hit enrage or come even remotely close.  This also requires 6-7 healers MAX because AOE healing (Especially COH) is just so efficient here!<br>
<br>
I don't see why any guild would put their members through the completely unnecessary step of gathering up resist gear for the add tanks in this fight.  The hydross tanks need maxed out resists but add tanks can go with 0 if you got enough tanks to pick up 1 add per tank.  Bringing in more tanks doesnt slow DPS down because the AOE can just push a lot harder and they end up having more time to DPS hydross himself.</div>

On an unrelated topic, do we know yet whether or not +spell hit still affects RD, or if it's exclusively +hit now?  This is pretty relevant to the question of whether to go for the BoJ chest or to wait and hope for the ZA chest to drop.</div>

		<div id="post_message_547597">Like most everyone else I want to start this off by thanking Chicken for such a wonderful post.  Other than the WOW Pally forums I have pretty much figured everything out on my own as I have gone.  Im not the type to sit and crunch numbers so I have learned quite a few things by reading this thread.  I do however still have a few questions.<br>
<br>
Before I ask though, let me give you some info on where I stand so you can more easily answer my questions.  Im in a medium sized guild I would say.  We can easily run weekly 10 mans but cant really manage to get enough on at one time to do a 25 man.  Im about half epiced out mostly out of Kara.  I am the guilds off tank, though I may start MT Kara since our MT needs nothing new out of there.  My weapon, unfortunatly, is still the Continuum Blade, oh how I hate it.  We will be starting ZA tommorrow.<br>
<br>
Okay, on to questions.  Ive read through this whole forum but its a lot to process so if I repeat a question already answered please forgive me.<br>
<br>
1.  Which blessing is more important for tanking?  I have always gone with Sanc but the other pally in the guild with Kings went ret and no longer has Kings, so which is more important?  Kings or Sanc?<br>
<br>
2.  I have always used Ret aura, but after reading the discussion I think that im better off with Ret in 5 mans and maybe trash pulls in Kara, and Devo for bosses?  How would having a pally with Sanctity Aura in the party affect this?  At all?<br>
<br>
3.  Which food to you generally go with?  Stamina or Spell damage?  I have always gome stamina but saw mention of spell damage food somewhere and wanted to check.<br>
<br>
4.  With 2.3 here has there been a definate decision on reckoning or one handed weapon specialization?  Personally, im thinking of leaning towards reckoning, just because with a ret pally in the group im going to be keeping something other than sotc on the mob, like light.  And more swings means more help.<br>
<br>
5.  Ive seen a lot of talk about Imp Seal of the Crusader vs Imp Judgement, and Spell Warding vs PoJ.  Ive even seen talk on here of taking anticipation out in favor of PoJ or Imp SotC.  My question is... What if you took out Precision?  If you took 3 from there and dropped it into PoJ you get the benefit of both it and Spell Warding.  To me this sounds like the best option, but like I said, I dont crunch numbers.  Is precision more important than anticipation or PoJ?<br>
<br>
Basically, this is where i stand... <br>
<br>
<a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?talent=sZV0tIx0dgMqtVbx" target="_blank">Talent Calculator - World of Warcraft</a> <br>
<br>
Where should I put my last three points?  Im thinking PoJ, but could be wrong.  Maybe Precision is just that important.  Thoughts?<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance for any answers and comments.</div>

</div>The runspeed looks neat (I'm going to try it tonight in TK) but -3% chance to be hit by spells is not going to help terribly much as a tank.  Magic damage tends to be more burst-oriented, so you and your healers will have to be ready for it anyway whether you have a 3% less chance to take it or not.<br>
<br>
I've got both in my current build (had to go 4/5 anticipation and skip reckoning to make it work) but forced to choose I'd go with Precision.<br>
<br>
Regarding your other questions:<br>
<br>
Kings &gt; Sanctuary in 95%+ of tanking situations.  Part of the problem is that the damage reduction from Sanct is applied before armor, so if you have, say, 50% DR from armor then Sanct is only saving you 40 points per swing.  In most situations, the danger of getting bursted to death is greater than the danger of your healers running out of mana, so Kings is preferred for the extra stamina.<br>
<br>
Food is situational.  If you need the extra threat and survivability isn't an issue, spelldamage food.  If the opposite, stam food.<br>
<br>
Ret vs. Devo is again a situational decision, threat vs mitigation.  Obviously having a Ret paladin in group is going to do a lot for threat, so it's less likely you'd need Ret aura in that case.<br>

</div>Yes, especially since it will now be affecting taunts.  I haven't really found anywhere where I really wished I could run a whole lot faster while in the act of tanking mobs.  Sure, it'd be nice, but I don't think that'll dramatically improve your actual tanking performance.  3% chance for a spell to miss is nice, but meh.  Just seems too streaky of a mechanic to be throwing points into, especially when we're hard pressed to find spare talent points to start with.<br>
<br>
As for you other questions:<br>
1) Kings, kings, kings and more kings.  Sanctuary is nice to have when you're rocking 4+ pallies.  But the damage reduction is done pre-mitigation, which means it's really only useful for when you're really struggling with threat.  Even then, I'd still go with kings.<br>
2) I like ret, but devo is prolly a better option.  Again, depends on your threat generation.  If you add a ret-pally to your group, go with Devo and Sanctity.  If you don't have one in your party, go with what feels better.  The two keys to tanking are to keep the mobs on you, and don't die.  And you really only want to do the first to just past the point of where you're beating your dps on threat.  Anything after that is basically wasted mitigation that could save you from an unlucky string of hits.<br>
3) I go with stamina, but again that depends on where your threat generation is at.  If you're having trouble holding onto mobs, spell damage food is a pretty easy boost of theat, at a slight loss of hp (330ish if you're using crawdads).<br>
4) Hasn't been any good math on this.  I'll be going with 1-hand, because that helps when I'm forced to off-tank on stuff that's not hitting me constantly (VR, Gruul, etc).  But I'll certainly miss 2-hander reckoning procs while farming.</div>

</div>Is that really burst survivability? If you have 10000 damage incoming you're knocking off 400 of it. You're still taking 9600 damage. If you can survive the 9600 chances are you could have survived the 10k too. How often is the 400 damage difference really going to be a factor? The points in Spell Warding are just wasted points in general. It's getting tight in the prot side. I'm wondering if there may just be better economy spending those points elsewhere.</div>

</div><br>
It seems to me that this line of thinking argues for the 3% chance to resist, rather than the 4% knock off.  If burst is the problem, then what is 40 points taken off of that 10k hit?  Its practically nothing.  However a 3% chance to resist a burst spell of 10k is definatly better in my thought.<br>
<br>
Mathmatically if you get hit 100 times for 4k damage then you are going to take less damage with spell warding than PoJ... but its going to be at 40 points a hit.  PoJ is going to save you on the burst.  That's why im leaning towards PoJ if I had to pick one.</div>

</div>This is precisely backwards.  To make it through bursts, you need to reduce the threat that a max burst poses (by reducing the damage it does or increasing your ability to soak it) rather than decreasing the chances that a max burst will happen.  <br>
<br>
Eventually, you're going to eat a burst; you need to be able to survive that when it happens, so you're better off having those 100 4k bursts being 100 3.8K bursts than having them be 97 4K bursts.</div>

		<div id="post_message_547761">I think it really depends on the fight. If you can count on statistical certainty and a large number of spells hitting you, spell warding is better. If you can't count on that (for example: when being hit 10 or less times), it's far better to take no damage some of the time than less damage overall. <br>
<br>
I was curious about the overall stamina boost from switching enchants, but it's trivial; +3 stam. Really, I think a dedicated paladin tank that is dealing with spellcasters a lot is going to want both. If you can't have both, I'm not sure that 2 points in improved PoJ is worth it other than making things feel better overall for speed.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Is that really burst survivability? If you have 10000 damage incoming you're knocking off 400 of it. You're still taking 9600 damage. If you can survive the 9600 chances are you could have survived the 10k too. How often is the 400 damage difference really going to be a factor? The points in Spell Warding are just wasted points in general. It's getting tight in the prot side. I'm wondering if there may just be better economy spending those points elsewhere.</div>

</div>Nitpicking: 4% of 10k is 400, not 40.<br>
<br>
The thing about the "how often is that going to make a difference" argument is that you can apply it to <i>any</i> small upgrade in survivability.  (How often is the extra 200 armor on this chest going to make the difference?  How often is the extra 12 stamina from this enchant going to make a difference?  etc.)  You have to take these things in little pieces, but they add up.<br>
<br>
As far as burst survivability, the point, as Julian said, is that regardless of how much you stack "avoidance" type stats, sooner or later you <i>will</i> take the worst-possible-case burst, and you have to be able to survive it.  <br>
<br>
If I were a healer, I'd rather be the guy who has to heal through 100 9.6k magic bursts than the guy who has to heal through 97 10k magic bursts.  The less your health seesaws up and down, the easier it is on your healers, even if it's only a little bit.<br>

</div>First off, if you'r going to have to depend on JoL procs to survive or even help in healing you as MT, something is wrong.<br>
<br>
In your case, ZA is going to be challenging, to say the least, and I defenitly would drop reckoning and go for 1h spec. 1h spec helps when offtanking, reduces the chance that you get a nasty string of parries but on the other hand reduces your soloing potential.<br>
<br>
For your second question, due to the nature of RD and AS, I find running speed less important for us then say, warrior tanks. 3% less chance for a judgement/taunt to miss is too good to loose.<br>
<br>
About dropping anticipation: While defense may not be the best stat out there once you hit 490, Anticipation offers a very nice amount of avoidance for not that high a cost. Once you have a certain 'gear buffer', its a good spot to drop points, but its not something I would do in your case probably.</div>

</div>Kings. The STA bonus is huge, along with a marginal increase in avoidance (via AGI's dodge) and mitigation (via AGI's armor and STR's block value). Even the extra INT helps.

</div>Sanctity Aura is a huge boost to your threat, so much so that Ret might be redundant. In another case, you can still use Ret if you can have a Holy Paladin in your group to supply you with Devo. If you have neither, just call it either way depending on whether threat or survivability is more important.<br>

When in doubt, use Devo. I find it better to err on the side of someone pulling aggro (which they should've been watching anyway) rather than err on the side of getting gibbed.<br>

Tank gear generally has a lot of Defense Rating on it, so it's easy to pass the 490 Defense cap enough to allow you to drop points from Anticipation. However, (spell) hit rating can be quite difficult to find (or make up for) on tank gear barring a few specialized pieces.<br>

</div>Yes. Getting missed by a spell is like getting missed by an attack: Your raid healers are always dropping heals on you, so it doesn't matter when you take damage or not. What matters is how much you're getting hit for. <br>
<br>
Spell Warding's 4% reduction could mean the difference between being able to spam Flash of Light or rank 9 Holy Light on you (the former being much more efficient).<br>
<br>
PoJ's 3% chance to miss means nothing. Your healer is still bombing you with the big green numbers either way.</div>

On an unrelated topic, do we know yet whether or not +spell hit still affects RD, or if it's exclusively +hit now?  This is pretty relevant to the question of whether to go for the BoJ chest or to wait and hope for the ZA chest to drop.</div>

</div>I think he does but don't quote me on this...  I know we don't use a hunter's NR aura so he is likely at max without it;  He's a very susperstitious tank and goes way overboard on resistances.  He does the theorycrafting and knows that 365 should be the max but when we do Leo (He tanks Demon form, I solo tank Human Form) I have FR aura up and he's at almost 430 resist.  He tried it with 365 with aura and he claims he noticed a huge difference.  I just let him be; he's a great prot warrior so I don't mess with what he's got going.  <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
As for talent spec:  I don't see why any pally would want to spec into Spell Warding.  It's a decent damage reduction for spell damage but how often do we find ourselves tanking mobs that do a LOT of spelldamage?  That is almost always going to be the domain of prot warriors and is more or less the only area where they still have an appreciable advantage over pally tanks.<br>
<br>
Also, I personally did NOT want to lose reckoning entirely so I put 3 points into that and 4 into 1HWS.  On the ret side, I got the speed increase for fights like Al'ar and Leotheras.  The  minus to spell hit is just a side perk.  We have a ret pally in our guild (Who has been inactive lately - go figure.) so if he is in raid, he'll have the improved crusader debuff.<br>
<br>
I do also agree with what somebody else said about Argent Defender:  As your gear scales, the effective area where AD kicks in gets higher and higher.  I kept all of my points in AD for this reason.  My final spec turned out to be this:<br>

<br>
The only thing that I don't like about this spec is the lack of full toughness but with my current gear it's only 1-2% more physical damage reduction at most.  That is a lot but I think the other talents are better.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">As for talent spec: I don't see why any pally would want to spec into Spell Warding. It's a decent damage reduction for spell damage but how often do we find ourselves tanking mobs that do a LOT of spelldamage? That is almost always going to be the domain of prot warriors and is more or less the only area where they still have an appreciable advantage over pally tanks.</div>

</div>Definitely.  I don't tank all of the adds during hydross (We bring 5 tanks), I solo tank human form Leo (Guild's never killed him without me tanking human form) and tank Al'ar in P1 and P2 so I guess you got a good point!  Also, thanks for the quick pointer on how much toughness would actually end up affecting incoming damage;  I had been wondering about that for a while now.<br>
<br>
Has anybody done any of the bosses in ZA yet?  I've done the first two and the trash leading up to the fourth.  Having a pally tank for trash before second and fourth bosses seems to help out A LOT.  Otherwise, there seems to be little difference between tank classes that I can see so far.  Of course, the second boss requires only one tank so having a feral or prot pally who can heal for this fight would probably help a bit.<br>
<br>
Any other thoughts on ZA specifically with regards to pally tanking?</div>

I've been using a spam-heavy tank style up to this point, usually with JoW up on trash mobs and soft hitting raid bosses to prevent mana starvation and to keep the flow going from pull to pull. I've been very reluctant to drop Reckoning because of that... the extra swings are definitely noticeable in mana gain.<br>
<br>
Given changes elsewhere I'd like to adopt a more conservative approach, using JoC and relying on the extra holy threat over spamming all I can. It'd definitely be nice to grab the new Improved JoC. I'd be interested in hearing other's experience in doing a similar stylistic and talent change.<br>
<br>
<br>
Cloak pondering: I'm debating between purchasing the Farstrider Defender's Cloak and the new Slikk's Cloak. Either would be an improvement over my current Gilded Thorium Cloak. Nice as the latter one is, the former still seems superior for a paladin tank to me with its high block value.</div>

</div>I can't say with certainty, but on 3 vashj pulls with multiple taunts and shield tosses nothing missed or resisted ever.  Hardly conclusive, but I don't fight many tauntable bosses (I'm on add duty on Alar).  Got to say I'm damn happy I picked up the BF trinket though.<br>
<br>
As for Cons, you're right in that they did put a GCD on libram swapping, but you're incorrect about the calculations on it.  I'm not sure if it's just librams that work like this, but if I equip Eternal Rest and hit cons then swap I still get the (slightly) amped version.  I tested it multiple times yesterday (though because of some odd macro behavior with the GCD I disabled it about halfway through the run), and again today and I am entirely certain that the tick calculation is not calculated on tick but on cast.  I banked my +dam trinkets so I can't test that just now.</div>

</div>To expand a bit on this, since it's a very common misconception that Toughness suffers from diminishing returns; that's really dependent on how you view armor. If we're taking a look at it from only the tooltip damage reduction, then armor does suffer from diminishing returns. However, if we choose to look at the benefit in regards to how long it'll help you continue living, the benefit from armor actually becomes (nearly) linear.<br>
<br>
Let's take a look at an example of different armor values and how they'll help you live with a constant 20k health and 2k incoming purely melee DPS.<br>
<br>
0 Armor = 0% Damage Reduction = 2000 DTPS = 10 seconds to live<br>
5000 armor = 32% damage reduction = 1360 DTPS = 14.7 seconds to live (4.7 seconds more)<br>
10000 armor = 48% damage reduction = 1040 DTPS = 19.2 seconds to live (4.5 seconds more)<br>
15000 armor = 58% damage reduction = 840 DTPS = 23.8 seconds to live (4.6 seconds more)<br>
20000 armor = 65% damage reduction = 700 DTPS = 28.6 seconds to live (4.8 seconds more)<br>
<br>
As you can see, the actual increase in time to live stays roughly the same at ~4.6 seconds at each interval of 5k armor, or an approximate 45% increase from base time to live per 5k armor, or in a bit smaller terms that are more realistic as upgrades, 4.5% extra time to live per 500 armor. And yes, that is constant with any amount damage taken per second. The opposite also (obviously) applies to armor penetration, but using a "Time to live" metric makes less sense for dealing damage.</div>

The Badge one is the obvious choice, then the Hellfire/Zanger PvP one would seem to be 2nd, with Syth's after that, increasing your damage from Consecration.  Libram of Truth is basically like an enchant armor to cloak -- it's a fairly small upgrade but at the same time it's still mitigation.  Avengement Libram is probably not much of a threat increase since we don't really depend on our melee damage to begin with. <br>
<br>
I think I only need about 1-2% more avoidance and the HS Libram would be almost worthless, or am I missing something?  Also if I'm missing another Libram option...</div>

</div>When you say you tested it, did you just read the tooltip after switching out?  I would suspect that you would lose the block, but it would not surprise me if the holy shield spell checked for the libram, versus the actual hit checking for the libram.  Basically the difference between:<br>

             Block
          } else {
             Hit/crush
          }
       }
    }

}
if attacked {

   if number &lt; normalAmount(65) {
      Dodge/Miss/Parry/Block(normal block amount)
   } else {
       if Holy Shield {
          if number &lt; (normalAmount + HSnumber) {
             Block
          } else {
             Hit/crush
          }
       }
    }
}</pre>
</div>I think the only real way to test this would be to dress up in gear that is just at the avoidance cap w/libram (for whatever level of mob you're going to be testing on), and then see if you can cast holy shield, remove the libram, then see if you ever get a normal hit with charges left.</div>

</div>Well, the obvious choice would be <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32368"><span><span class="purplename">[Tome of the Lightbringer]</span></span></a> but there's a small minority of tankadins who have access to that (assuming it drops... sigh). I think Zeal is the best when you're the one putting up Crusader, or Eternal Rest for AoE. The new badge libram is ideal when you have a ret paladin doing Crusader, or in a situation where you need to put up a different judgement. Truth is useful in 10-mans or elsewhere where you provide your own Devotion, but I'd say the threat from other options outweighs an armor boost to an untalented aura.<br>

</div>Basically there's nothing fundamental that changes when you insert "Paladin" instead of "Warrior" in that thread.  Really, it's a matter of personal and group choice.  If you're a gamblin' man, and your group doesn't mind occasionally wiping to some "holy shit that was a lot of damage fast" moments, then stack avoidance.  If you want your incoming damage to be as predictable as possible, even if that means you might just hit a wall someplace, then stack mitigation and stamina.  Basically, avoidance will give you some freak deaths, and some freak successes, meaning sometimes you'll die on stuff you should easily beat, and sometimes you'll beat stuff you might not be expected to.<br>
<br>
Personally, I'm not one for extremes, so I tend to try to raise both up equally.  Also, you'll note a pretty big emphasis on removing crushing blows, which requires a high base avoidance to make sure holy shield covers the rest.  So a pally is sorta required to stack more avoidance than a warrior, because pushing off crushing blows on some fights is an absolute requirement.</div>

		<div id="post_message_550974">Presumably crushing blows are off the table no matter what set they use. <br>
<br>
I would approach it two ways. The first is by looking at the amount of damage in that is required to keep mana available via SA (assuming mana pots as well). From that, you can look at specific encounters and determine whether or not that boss will be able to do that kind of damage reasonably given certain levels of avoidance. Or at what avoidance level is feasible. <br>
<br>
The second is to look at the most common bad case scenario and determine whether or not your HP is adequate to deal with that. That can be accomplished by looking at special attacks, normal attacks, and speed of attacks; for instance, you could assume one special attack followed by a normal and then a parried normal as a baseline. Determine how much damage could possibly be done, and then see whether or not your HP could possibly deal with that after buffing.<br>
<br>
My personal view is that it's a lot easier to buff stamina then it is to buff avoidance via consumables, and while less streaky damage is good it is better to deal with more avoidance after you've gotten enough stamina to deal with big streaks as long as the overall item cost isn't too high. In your specific case, I suspect that the 55% avoidance set is too sacrificing HP, and there is likely a sweet spot in between where you have 50% avoidance and around 13.5K HP. That's probably a better compromise.</div>

</div>I think it's worth mentioning that the Libram of Avengement's crit rating buff applies to both melee and spell crit, although that doesn't really change much given that the only ability in our tanking repertoire that can crit is JoR.<br>
<br>
I like the idea of using Libram of Zeal in the meantime. We don't normally run with a Ret Paladin, I specifically picked up Imp. SotC in my build and I definitely feel the threat increase from using JotC instead of JoW.</div>

I think the only real way to test this would be to dress up in gear that is just at the avoidance cap w/libram (for whatever level of mob you're going to be testing on), and then see if you can cast holy shield, remove the libram, then see if you ever get a normal hit with charges left.</div>

Are you really using mana/rejuv pots over ironshields when tanking? Doesn't the extra armor from ironshield automatically makes warriors better tanks for physical damage too if you're needing to use other potions?

				<div style="font-style:italic">There's a lot of effective health vs avoidance discussion in the warrior thread, but not so much here.  Plus, that discussion seems mostly to focus on people proving that 65% avoidance beats 25% avoidance, which isn't really news.<br>
<br>
So, for an example, unbuffed, I'm normally 14.3k health and 17.3k armor (incl. Devotion, I'm a stam stacker), with 45% avoidance.  However, I can drop to 12.8k health and roughly 15.5k armor and raise my avoidance to 55%.  I'm currently MT of a party wrapping up Kara (Prince is on farm, Nightbane isn't a sure thing quite yet) and through the first boss of ZA.<br>
<br>
What's a good way of approaching the question of which gear set-up is better?</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Gearing for stamina increases the total amount of burst damage you can survive; gearing for avoidance reduces the chance of that worst case happening.  But it doesn't reduce it to zero; at some point that worst-case burst <i>will</i> happen, and you'll have to be able to survive it.  Given the choice between "I can definitely survive any burst up to 18k" or "I can definitely survive any burst up to 16k and there's a small but non-zero chance of me getting bursted for more than that" I'll take the former.<br>
<br>
The other argument is that gearing for avoidance also saves healer mana.  But I've never seen a fight where healer longevity was a greater concern than tank survivability, given the amount of mana that can be had from flasking, chain-chugging potions, etc.  Going for avoidance might save your healers some gold spent on potions or whatever, but if you wipe because your health pool wasn't quite big enough to survive a burst, then your healers are out all the consumables they spent on that attempt, and so is your dps, and so are you.<br>
<br>
That's why I always go for stamina, stamina, stamina, so long as threat and crushes/crits are covered.<br>

The nice thing about Engineering aside from the helm is that either Gnomish or Goblin engineering gives you access to 45-stam trinkets that are not unique.  For people who don't have the cash for Darkmoon cards or an epic mount, that can be a pretty nice option.</div>

		<div id="post_message_551371">Avoidance saves healer mana via canceling while stamina saves healer mana via less overhealing, really, so the actual benefit for healer mana is really hard to figure out. The point is that you can't say avoidance helps healer mana while ignoring the healer mana saved by the extra stam, not to mention armor.<br>
<br>
Another thing is that for paladins avoidance is actually more useful than for warriors (after crush immunity of course) as the chance for wearing off holy shield with a slow attacking boss (via parries) isn't as high as for a warrior since it requires you not avoiding all the 5 hits (so that they become blocks and use HS up) or have even more boss parries to compensate, which is just much higher chance than for a warrior to not avoid 2 attacks on a parry burst. Since for a paladin there's a (1-avoidance)^5 and for a warrior there's a (1-avoidance)^2 in the "do I get burst?" factor, avoidance helps paladins more. How much more depends on what chance that kind of burst really does have to happen and how much avoidance reduces it - but if it's high then reducing it means it'll still happen and you need to have the stam for it, and if it's a rediculessly low chance (as in something that would happen on average once every 50 fights or more...) then why the hell are you worrying about it anyway, worry about bursts that are more likely to happen.<br>
If you treat all different "types of bursts" the way I just did, you'll see that the effectiveness of avoidance against them is actually not really that great compared to stamina, or that they just have such a low chance of happening (say 5 parry hastes and a crush...) it's really not what you should be worrying about.<br>
So basically either the chance for the burst to happen is already extremely low or that stamina will help you handle it better than the avoidance reducing its chance to happen. And even the low chance burst would still be helped with more stam...<br>
Even though paladins gain more "reduce chance of burst" from avoidance than warriors due to how holy shield works, stmina is probably still better to keep you alive through fights.</div>

</div>I am pretty sure you have that completely backwards, considering holy shield is twice as many charges over time than warrior's shield block (8 in 10 vs 2 in 5 ). This means we have a far lower chance of getting crushed. Unless you are referring to some boss that could strip holy shield so fast that its the time before we can put it back up again that you are referring, to.</div>

		<div id="post_message_551534">Something I thought that you might want to address in any FAQ-type section is how your threat from getting hit works off partial and full blocks.   i.e. You still will get full threat from Holy Shield/BoSac/Ret Aura off a partial block, the only difference when you fully block an attack is that Retribution Aura will not damage the attacker.   BoSac/Holy Shield will always proc off ANY block.  See evidence below.</div>

		<div id="post_message_551652">I think for prot paladins engineering needs to be one of the choices. The tanking helm is just great for mitigation/avoidance and is fairly easy to acquire early on (basically requires one heroic). The goblin rocket launcher is one of the best pulling weapons in the game and is a great complement to AS, given that it only hits one mob no matter what and requires no mana. That it gives +45 stam is delicious gravy. <br>
<br>
There are other nice things about engineering. Bombs are good for paladin leveling in aoe, you get handy things like underwater breathing skills and parachute cloaks and cloaking devices and remote controls. There's no reason to do blacksmithing for the weapons for prot, and the armor has one piece that is at all better than the alternative, and it's not really that much better.<br>
<br>
Jewelcrafting isn't a bad choice either given the unique gems, but I don't think it gives the benefit that the helm and trinket do.<br>
<br>
The other option is to just go mad money and get herbalism. If I were to do it again, I'd probably do herb/eng or herb/alch. Mining is nice but hardly necessary for engineering, and herbalism makes more money later on. <br>
<br>
In other news, there have been some interesting parses recently from Hyjal (at maintankadin)where holy shield factors in only marginally in the overall threat output. I was kind of surprised, but HS was accounting for less than 10% of total damage. The person in question had about 60% avoidance and was averaging one HS charge per cast. Their threat was still good and this was not gimping for avoidance either. I'm starting to wonder whether improved HS is actually needed post-SSC given a high enough avoidance. I realize that you can't get rid of it early on, especially against certain fights - but later when your gear has high avoidance, it might not be necessary.</div>

Imp Holy Shield is definitely more beneficial to single target tanking than AoE.  It gives us one of our main benefits over Warriors and Druids - ability to negate crushes on fast hitting bosses.  It also provides a nice threat boost against single fast hitting mobs/bosses.<br>
<br>
In an AoE situation, you don't care about crush avoidance and you block so often from a decent block rating that the short uptime on HS charges don't factor in much.  On a typical Hyjal trash clear, HS accounts for a little over 10% of my damage while Consecrate counts for 50-60%.<br>
<br>
I think it's a mistake to gear for avoidance in an AoE situation.  When I first stepped foot in Hyjal, I ran with over 40% block rating at the cost of very little avoidance.  It's down to around 28% since I no longer use a seperate AoE tanking set, but avoidance is the last thing on my mind when I'm tanking Hyjal trash.  I would much much rather block a hit than avoid it.  Staying alive is the least of your worries in Hyjal.  Healing on the trash waves is so trivial if you're taking too much damage just tell one more healer to stop DPSing and throw some heals on you.  The name of the game is threat and you will generate much more threat with a low avoidance/high block rating set.</div>

</div>Right, but what are the probabilities? In 10 seconds time, how many bosses can hit 8 times against a paladin that has 50% avoidance?<br>
<br>
It's really necessary against something like Prince, but Prince isn't the best example of a generic boss. If you're the one responsible for tanking the fast hitters then it seems like it's going to always be useful, but if you're not and you're tanking more in general, other talents may be better.<br>
<br>
I don't know whether it's worth cutting the points in general. It seems like it is another OH SHIT button, where most of the time you won't eat through those charges but occasionally you will. I suspect downranking is more profitable, but it's an interesting thing to note that HS does not appear to be as much threat as other sources as you progress, and it is very rare to fight a boss that can hit enough times to eat more than 4 charges in 10 seconds time.<br>
<br>
And this wasn't tanking Hyjal trash; this was tanking Rage. I was curious and checked out other parses, and against things like Hydross and Mag, HS damage was only 14-15% of total threat. Prince accounted for 35-40% of total threat, but that's not much of a surprise. Obviously this is only a few parses, but it's interesting to parse boss fights that aren't so paladin-friendly.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Right, but what are the probabilities? In 10 seconds time, how many bosses can hit 8 times against a paladin that has 50% avoidance?<br>

It's really necessary against something like Prince, but Prince isn't the best example of a generic boss.

Sorry, I didn't realize you were refering to just tanking Rage Winterchill.  In which case none of what I wrote applies.  <br>
<br>
We're back to the old avoidance vs. mitigation or avoidance vs. stam debate which has been covered quite a bit on various threads in these forums.<br>
<br>
As for HS itself, I agree it could be buffed because it contributes so little against slow or infrequently hitting mobs.  But I honestly can't see anything worth giving up our role as the best tanks against fast hitting mobs for.  Two talent points buys us that niche.  For me, it seems a fair price to pay.</div>

</div>I think you're right, and those two points are one of the things that separates pally tanks from the rest. But it's something that was somewhat of a taboo subject before. I mean, you ALWAYS take imp HS, right? and you always cast it at max rank because of the high damage and threat it produces. Well, turns out that this isn't always true, and in cases where mana is something of an issue it may actually be better to save on holy shield and spam consecrate and keep the Seal/judgment rotation going. <br>
<br>
It's mostly a matter of me trying to find any points that might be considered untouchable to get other talents worth getting.</div>

</div>Only one way to find out, right? .  Personally, I'm not to the point where I can safely drop imp HS, either from a threat or crushing blow perspective.  But if your job is only to ever tank single target mobs that aren't as crazy as TW or Prince, then I could see dropping it.<br>
<br>
I'm not so certain about lower rank Holy Shields though.  The only fights I have trouble with mana on are ones where I'm not taking enough damage, and then it's not that important to me if I get a crushing blow here or there  In this case, downranking will actually hurt you twice, by not giving you more damage and by the reduced inherent threat of the lower ranked blocks.</div>

</div>Likewise, alot of the trash is very AOE oriented and although we out gear it, you can basically ignore CC on alot of the pulls and just AOE it down, even when we had a scout call in some adds they can be aoe tanked rather easily.<br>
<br>
We also pushed the Fireboss to 35% faster then anticipated and decided to push it and I tanked all the birds off to the side and blew them up, I used LoH and had 32 odd +fire debuffs but it's better then waiting for more hatchers.<br>
<br>
I also discovered, which I assume is a bug that was overlooked; But during P3 Zul'jin with the tornadoes even if you don't use any abilities and just melee-refresh a judgement you will be zapped. From memory melee refreshing a seal re-casts it and although it takes no mana you will take a nature hit for your trouble it's more then worth it for this phase for rogues/fury warriors and F.Driuds, though.</div>

		<div id="post_message_553516">I think many of you are being a bit to conservative in your tanking style.  My personal choice is to lean more toward threat than you all do. but then our raids usualy run healer lite and dps heavy so maybe thats why I produce so much threat.  I go with a 0/40/21 build.  <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?talent=sZVhLhx0zgTobVfx0hMz" target="_blank">Talent Calculator - World of Warcraft</a>  which shows I do about 17% more holy damage than most do. so if you take the .5tps per spell damage that chicken lists on the first post I get probably  closer to .7 per spell damage.  Avenger shield is unreliable at best, and spikey. so this allows me to wear more tank gear and have to worry about spell damage less. Though I still sit at 410 spell damage.   I have had great sucess doing this and am a MT for my guild. <br>
<br>
I think spell miss is better than 4% reduction, and it also fits into my build nicely.<br>
<br>
I think reckoning is nessesary.<br>
<br>
Argent defender just got debunked by 10% more stam. As I have been tanking since the patch and the healers have only had praises at my health total and havent notice me not having argent defender. <br>
<br>
I just added the percision, and am happy with it.<br>

I agree with him completely.  Our prot trees are so bloated now that no pally can get EVERY talent that they want.  Pre-2.3, a sanctity aura build seemed to be a bit more viable because our lower HP and somewhat crappy itemization had us leaning towards a high-threat, multi-target niche.  With how much HP we got in 2.3 along with better itemization, seeing a pally MT stuff is no longer uncommon.  Especially if you are your guild's MT you should be absolutely fine on threat.<br>
<br>
Think of it this way:  You are tackling content that warriors have tanked traditionally and they more or less have a lower threat output than you.  As long as you have +400 spelldamage, tanking everything in T5 content shouldnt be an issue with regards to threat.  I've tanked pretty much everything in SSC and TK and some of them hit VERY hard.  I have NEVER had an issue with threat however.  Maintaining more than 1,000 TPS is not too hard and any DPS that exceeds that is doing at LEAST 1,300 DPS.  A good dpser in T5 content seems to average around 1,000 DPS in most fights by what I've experienced.  If they manage to exceed a tank doing 1,000 TPS on a tank and spank kind of boss they are just not watching their aggro.<br>

</div>We did it by letting one hatcher from the first group live and letting him pop all the birds on one side and killing them (making sure to kill the hatcher before he could run over and pop the other side).  Next set of hatchers, we killed both to let my fire debuff expire, and then for the third set we let a hatcher pop all the remaining eggs and killed them.  FR gear is not strictly necessary here, but it does make things easier and safer if you have it.<br>
<br>
You could also bubble after the first set to clear the debuff (or spend a crapton of mana cleansing/dispelling them all off), and/or you could use the 35% trigger to activate the second side rather than wait for a hatcher.</div>

</div>Yeah I did this using that handy /cancelaura macro, Which I was also able to use on our second clear on the bear boss. Since he is tauntable and we lost our OT at ~20% popped DI - Taunt - Cancelaura - kill to clear the double bleeds.<br>
<br>
We are perhaps the only tanking class capable of pulling this off, there is always SW though, I guess.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Well as I said we have a dps heavy raid, and when I can provide the 1300tps that I am , it allows for more dps over all raid.  If a dpser is having to watch his aggro then he is not working toward his full dps potential.  We have many dpsers who sit above the 1000dps mark and we are largely in t4 just begining our t5 content. Devo aura is of almost no worth and I would only use it as a secondary aura, and the ret aura should be the 3rd, and only if you dont need resists.<br>
<br>
(edit: grammar)</div>

	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Just because I feel like doing some math:<br>
Tank doing 1300 TPS.<br>
Rogue gets 0.7*0.71 = 0.497 threat modifier (0.497 threat per damage). 1300 / 0.497 = 2615 DPS<br>
Enh shaman: 0.7*0.7 = 0.49. 1300/0.49 = 2653 DPS<br>
<br>
Even, in the worst case, a non-subtlety moonkin can bust out 1300 / 0.7 = 1857 DPS (and that's not even counting the 30% ranged buffer - if you count that it'd be 2.6k DPS again).<br>
<br>
Obviously, here, your sustained TPS is overkill - yes, there's a difference between the DPS someone does when they're wary of the tank's TPS and the DPS they do when they know the tank has it solidly. However, doing twice as much threat as you need to, especially when you're throwing away obvious survivability boosts to do so, strikes me as a bad trade.<br>

These calculations are not factoring in Misdirects (More aggro), DPS giving you a few seconds to build aggro etc.  It also doesn't factor in aggro drops (Fade, Feint, Feign Death, Invisibility, SoulShatter, Die+Ankh, etc.).  When you factor these in, the number that dpsers have to do to pass you up goes way higher than 1300 TPS.  Especially if you are your guild's MT godsmacked, you are generating PLENTY enough aggro if you can maintain 1000 TPS.  I could maybe see if your guild utilized you for high-threat fights like Void Reaver or Leotheras.  It's a completely different story if you're tanking Morogrim who hits like a freaking truck and DPS is off killing murlocs half of the time anyways ;-).<br>
<br>
Like I said earlier, recruit a ret pally if your guild is serious about you MTing and invest max talent points into stam/mitigation.</div>

I'd be hard-pressed to believe 1300 sustained TPS even with a 0/40/21 build ... Imp. Seal of the Crusader, Conviction and Sanc Aura are the only direct threat benefits you gain. I'm not even sure which threat abilities we have work off melee crit rate (white damage crit is pretty inconsequan, ISotC can easily be gotten once you get some more gear and can drop a few points out of parry (from a conventional 49/12 build) and Sanc Aura is only a 10% scaling on our holy damage. In short, the ret threat buffs you have mean you'd be sustaining 1100 TPS (or telling fibs) or thereabouts without them. That's still way overkill.</div>

		<div id="post_message_559435">Hey guys, I'm new here and I must say that I'm loving what I'm seeing. I've finally found an output for knowledgeable end game prot pallies that I can relate to.<br>
<br>
I was wondering, for those of you who are more savvy with Excel than I could ever be, if there was a way to setup a gear spreadsheet much like our Ret brothers did over there in their post.  Ideally, my concept is to have a calculator that from the end game gear, finds what the best gear configuration is to optimize stamina, armor and block value but also obviously having to meet the 104 mark.  Also, to, maybe setup a coefficient for spell damage or even a spell damage cap if there were a value.  I know in my experience I rarely have trouble of raiders pulling agro off of me and i'm running about 500 SD .<br>
<br>
Let me know what you guys think, i.e. if it's feasible.  Hell, I'm willing to learn from one of you how to do it myself if anyone had the time to.  I'd like to make one up for healing just shits and giggles if I ever had the time.  But, once again, great hub here and tank on!</div>

</div>It's a 10% chance for 95~115 damage, or 105 damage.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Over time, that averages out to 10.5 damage per hit.  With iRF, that's around 20~ threat each time you're hit.   <br>
<br>
<br>
Noticeable?   I doubt it.  (Making up numbers, I think you'd need a 10~20% increase/decrease to really notice the benefit of a single item; I'm sure you dealing much more than 20 threat on average each time you're hit )   <br>
<br>
<br>
Useful?  Really depends on what you're doing, I think.</div>

</div>People tend to seriously overestimate the effect of gearing up on "when-hit" procs.  A typical paladin entering Kara might have ~40% full avoidance; a typical T6 paladin will probably have around 50%.  That's a ~16% drop in the number of hits you take; is that really going to make such a huge difference?<br>
<br>
Anyway, as Fiola said, it's about 10 damage per hit on average, so look at it as a 40% buff to Ret aura that's active even when you're not using Ret aura.  It also works on casters, which can be handy when it procs on a caster mob in someplace like Shattered Halls.<br>
<br>
And on top of that, it's 51 stamina, so what's not to like?</div>

</div>Point for Point you will get more threat out of each point of spell damage than just about anything else. The only thing that mongoose will do is increase your melee crit rate which is very insignificant with a spell damage weapon (since it has low base damage anyway).</div>

In my eyes Mongoose = 5.2% dodge (kings) and a very minor threat boost and seems to proc constantly with my current (reckoning) build. I also believe in putting mitigation and avoidance before threat generation.<br>
<br>
What do you think? Merc Gladiator MH with 40 Spell Damage or Goose?<br>
<br>
And by the way, if you haven't guessed already, I'm new to the forums so sorry if this has been answered before :P</div>

</div>Well you only need enough threat to get to where your dps can go full-out on your tank target.  Past that, it's nearly pointless.  So if you're at that stage, all the time, without the additional 40 spell damage, then don't worry about it, and go mongoose.  If you're not, I'd say that holding threat on your target is more important than an inconsistent proc for avoidance's sake.  That's really dependent on your dps, your threat, and your responsibilities though.</div>

</div>I'm biased against chance-on-hit effects for tanking, especially for a class/spec that doesn't have instant weapon attacks to boost the proc rate.  <br>
<br>
I go for spelldamage on every tanking weapon.  You may not need it right away, but chances are pretty good you will before you get a weapon upgrade.  It's especially nice for resist fights where you have to sacrifice some of your other spelldamage gear.  When I AoE tank Hydross adds, my weapon is basically the only spelldamage I've got.</div>

I'd be hard-pressed to believe 1300 sustained TPS even with a 0/40/21 build ... Imp. Seal of the Crusader, Conviction and Sanc Aura are the only direct threat benefits you gain. I'm not even sure which threat abilities we have work off melee crit rate (white damage crit is pretty inconsequan, ISotC can easily be gotten once you get some more gear and can drop a few points out of parry (from a conventional 49/12 build) and Sanc Aura is only a 10% scaling on our holy damage. In short, the ret threat buffs you have mean you'd be sustaining 1100 TPS (or telling fibs) or thereabouts without them. That's still way overkill.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">People tend to seriously overestimate the effect of gearing up on "when-hit" procs.  A typical paladin entering Kara might have ~40% full avoidance; a typical T6 paladin will probably have around 50%.  That's a ~16% drop in the number of hits you take; is that really going to make such a huge difference?<br>
<br>
Anyway, as Fiola said, it's about 10 damage per hit on average, so look at it as a 40% buff to Ret aura that's active even when you're not using Ret aura.  It also works on casters, which can be handy when it procs on a caster mob in someplace like Shattered Halls.<br>
<br>
And on top of that, it's 51 stamina, so what's not to like?</div>

</div>The above post is has it right with this card, and the Vengance card is a permanent part of my AoE trashing tanking set, but is not present in my boss tanking set, my healing set, or my resist sets. It creates the most noticable difference in Hyjal, in waves with Necromancers or Banshees, in that I can hold aggro from Banshees or Necromancers for well over half the duration of the wave, even though they are at range and in the AoE pit where I am. I can work the camera, and see the fairly frequent popping of the trinket on these ranged attackers, enough that by the time melee or single target casters get to them, I still hold aggro fairly well until 30% or so. Yes, I can build threat faster on targets through other spells or attacks, but if my attention is being held by 50-60% of the trash wave that is directly on me, any threat I can build at all on the ranged to keep them off the healers is critical.<br>
<br>
No, I do not use this trinket on boss fights, since those go to much more avoidance, reducing the frequency of procing, and it would only proc on a target I am already generating massive threat against, and isn't present in any fight where I am not expected to be the focus of damage.<br>
<br>
Note: I have been noticing a few bugs with this, in that it procs off of ANYTHING, and sometimes the logic of how it reflects the damage is less than ideal. The most glaring example of this was in heroic Bot a few days ago. One of pulls just before the 3rd boss, I got that Curse of Doom like effect (not the name of the effect, can't recall it at the moment). We cleared the pull and were drinking when the debuff ended, dealt me shadow damage, and it apparently string matched to find out who dealt me damage. The trinket proc'ed on the left channeler in front of the boss, who we hadn't pulled yet. This pulled the group obviously, which was quite surprising to my party members who hadn't see the vengance proc damage floating above his head.</div>

</div>Agreed full-heartedly, but I found the multiple tanking sets difficult to actually obtain till well through SSC/TK.

b) Not all bosses hit for upwards of the 4200-5700 damage to kill you when you fall to ~3-4k<br>
<br>
(Najentus average is ~3900, EoS hits very weak, Akama adds (if they ever get re-enabled) hit weak, Infernals on Anatheron hit less than that.  Doomguards on Azgalor deal less than that. Murlocs on Tidewalker hit weakly. Sharkiss + Pet each hit less than that. Hydross adds hit less than that. Lurker adds hit less than that. Leotheras hits for less than that. Vashj hits for less than that, as do her adds. Phoenixes on Al'ar. Trash in Hyjal waves. Etc.)<br>
<br>
c) Most bosses that do hit that hard have a somewhat slow attack speed. This means unless your healers are sleeping on the job, you'll get at least a couple of small heals between hits.  Also consider, at your gear level I place you in early t5 content. Most bosses already aren't hitting hard enough to blow through your AD. At 18750 HP, AD would kick in at ~6500 hit points.  Assume you're taking a boss that hits for ~6500.<br>
<br>
Without AD you would have to be at 35% health to survive the hit.  With AD you could surive it as long as you have 4550 HP, meaning you could survive that hit anywhere from 24.2% upwards.   Even some hits that could potentially leapfrog AD can turn into saves.  For instance, assume a 7000 point hit. 4900-6500 would be survived.  6500-7000 would be death. 7000+ would be a survive.  26-35% and 37.3% upwards would be survivable.<br>
<br>
You can't often take 2 back to back hits without heals on a boss that hits for upwards of 7000 damage anyways.  If a boss is hitting that hard, you're going to be spammed.   If you manage to actually get down to 3-4k (that would be approximately 2 hits without heals) and then take another hit without getting a heal, you've got serious problems that aren't related to your talent tree.<br>
<br>
d) Many bosses have periodic and secondary abilities that bring you low that AD can help with. (Whirlwind on Leo, Inner Demon, Bat dung on Vashj, pouding on VR, flame patch on al'ar. Phoenix dot on Kael'thas. Infernal DoT on Anatheron. Doomfire DoT on Archimonde. Environmental DoTs on Supremus. EoA dot.) Many of these things are things you can avoid, (Like doomfire, flame patch or volcano on supremus)  Most shouldn't kill you outright (Whirlwind, Flame Patch etc) But occasionally an unfortunate series of events puts you at low health when you get hit with one of these things.  Or a volcano spawns directly under you, or something like that.  AD will give you a bit of slack to turn what might have been a death into a near miss.<br>
<br>
AD is by far one of the few talents in the prot tree I could not get by without.</div>

</div>Do you have a link or name of said add-on?  I'd love to track that kinda stuff.<br>
<br>
As for AD, well personally I think it's yet another, albeit not as apparent, stamina boost.  And I'll take as many of those as I can.  I also find that it has great utility outside raiding as well, especially when grinding a lot of mobs, and in 5-mans where the healing might be less consistent.</div>

<br>
Assuming 21k HP buffed, AD kicks in at 7,350 HP for me.  30% of that is 2205 HP.  Assuming that AD doesn't get leapfrogged, that means that you would effectively have 9,555 HP from 35 to 0%.  Sure it can be leapfrogged but how often do pallies tank something that hits for that much?  Now compare to us tanking something like Murlocs or the hunter add on karathress and you can see that this is a great ability!<br>

</div>You're still leaving yourself open for a grave then, and a potential wipe.  Personally, I always tank the murlocs on his ass, and just deal with the graves (Divine Shield cancel macro, warrior and druid AoE taunts).  But if you're going to go the super-safe route, I'd suggest having a holy pally run down and spam holy lights on some convenient warlocks to get them to you, as opposed to running all over the place.  Also, who are they aggroing on to?  Druids and shammies really need to lay off of healing until you get the murlocs, and priests need to be on the ball with their fades.<br>
<br>
But really, it sounds like more of an issue with your healers than with you. 2-3 holy lights with Righteous Fury up should be enough to snag all the murlocs to you, if the other healers are only healing the MT as much as they need to (and splitting the responsibility).<br>
<br>
One last thing that could help is the switch weapon macro listed in the first post.  Basically, switch to your healing weapon and shield before the murlocs pop, and it should significantly improve the amount you're healing for, and thus your threat.  Just remember to switch back before the murlocs get to you .</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">You're still leaving yourself open for a grave then, and a potential wipe.  Personally, I always tank the murlocs on his ass, and just deal with the graves (Divine Shield cancel macro, warrior and druid AoE taunts).  But if you're going to go the super-safe route, I'd suggest having a holy pally run down and spam holy lights on some convenient warlocks to get them to you, as opposed to running all over the place.  Also, who are they aggroing on to?  Druids and shammies really need to lay off of healing until you get the murlocs, and priests need to be on the ball with their fades.<br>
<br>
But really, it sounds like more of an issue with your healers than with you. 2-3 holy lights with Righteous Fury up should be enough to snag all the murlocs to you, if the other healers are only healing the MT as much as they need to (and splitting the responsibility).<br>
<br>
One last thing that could help is the switch weapon macro listed in the first post.  Basically, switch to your healing weapon and shield before the murlocs pop, and it should significantly improve the amount you're healing for, and thus your threat.  Just remember to switch back before the murlocs get to you .</div>

I tried doing holy light spamming and it didn't work for me.  This is how our guild does it:<br>
<br>
We bring 4 tanks.  The tank for Morogrim, tank for the murlocs and two additional tanks.  We tank morogrim on the right side of his room where that little cubby hole is with the tents.  All healers stand DIRECTLY behind morogrim except for one healer who heals graves.  <br>
<br>
When the murlocs spawn, the two OT's pick up the murlocs not too far from where they spawn and bring them back.  They don't pick them all up or do it perfectly but that's ok...  The point is to prevent the healers from building up aggro the whole time while the murlocs are running towards them.  The pally tank basically stands a tad bit away from the healer pack and consecrates.  Because of where we tank him, the adds coming from the entrance get there about 5 seconds before the adds coming from the side leading leading to FLK.<br>
<br>
I (or the other pally tank) consecrate about 4-5 seconds before the first pack gets to me.  The dumb murlocs run through the consecrate and start taking ticks.  Because of where I consecrate, it is far enough out that it hits them before they hit the healers but at the same time it's on top of the healers so if they do run through the consecrate it's still ticking when the murlocs stop.  Because I consecrated 4-5 seconds before the first pack got there, I can then drag over to the right and re-consecrate in front of the second pack so the same thing happens to them.<br>
<br>
The OT's on the murloc packs never pick them up for more than a few seconds or pick them all up but it's enough that if a murloc does get through they don't obliterate the healers like an entire pack does.  Doing it this way seems to be more technical but I think it greatly simplifies the whole fight and provides much more control to the fight.  We never have healers die anymore from murloc aggro unless they're standing away from the healer "pack".<br>
<br>
<br>
By the way, the OT's also serve another purpose.  If the pally tank gets graved, they can AOE taunt until I get back since where we position him doesn't grant the pally tank grave immunity.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Quick question about Tidewalker...<br>
<br>
The guild has me positioned for the fight near the water graves but far away enough from tidewalker that i do not get graved myself. The rest of the casters are further up the ramp between myself and tidewalker. I had a bit of a hard time grabbing agro from the murlocs from just spamming holy light (it did not help that i ususally could only get 2-3 heals off).<br>
<br>
I was just wondering if it would be a reasonable strategy to move up the ramp immediately after watery grave is cast so that i can grab the murlocs with consecration/holy light and then move back down to my original spot by the graves so when the cooldown of the watery graves is up i can be far away from it enough that i do not get hit by it.</div>

	</tbody></table>
</div>One thing we ran into trouble with is that apparently there's a range limit on healing threat.  We had MT healers and raid healers picking up aggro and dying before I could get it off of them because they murlocs were coming into threat range of them long before they came into my threat range.  To fix this problem, have the healers stand at max healing range and as close to you as possible.  This minimizes the window during which they can get healing aggro and you can't.  Shadow priests, too.<br>
<br>
EDIT:  3 heals has always been plenty for me, and 2 usually does fine.  Make sure you have pre-set healing targets that nobody else is allowed to touch until you get murloc aggro.  Warlocks work best for this, of course.<br>
<br>
Also, if you can arrange for full pushback-immunity (earthshield + Conc. aura, or a PW:S as the murlocs approach) that might help you finish that third heal if that's giving you trouble.</div>

Here's what we do: I have a warlock, who starts lifetapping as soon as he quakes (knocking the hp of people down), I have a macro to heal that lock only (max rank HL spam). I need to cast 2-3 heals to ensure all murlocs reach me. Other healers need to give you a 2-3 s head start before they heal after the quake comes (except mt healers). Even so, they should be carefull with aoe healing (god i hated shamans here).<br>
<br>
Basically, if noone did aoe healing till murlocs reached me and no fancy big number healing, murlocs would reach me and stick to me like glue. That IS the tricky part however. We also have 1-2 druids here, who are dpsing in cat, but shift to bear and aoe taunt (1 at a time) if I get tombed (first time I bubble out of it, second time they need to taunt).<br>
<br>
We're going to try it with a holy pala in pvp gear this week.</div>

How many holy pallies do you run with?  I've found that unless someone is healing when they're not supposed to, the murlocs will _always_ be on a paladin or a priest when they come running up.  If you stack the other pallies on top of where you're tanking them( if it's right on TW's ass then you get the benefit of AoE hitting him ), then you don't have to move at all in order to tank.  Priests should absolutely be using fade here though, it's basically the ideal situation for that spell.  If it gets resisted, toss them a BoP.  Basically, I think our job as a tank is complicated enough as it is during the murloc time, and running around trying to gather them all up every earthquake just makes things a helluv a lot harder.  But if it's working for you, then more power to ya.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">As the author of the non-Fubar version, I was really shocked by how much AD actually kicks in. On "plain sailing" trash mobs and bosses, it's never active (as you'd expect), but with dicier pulls and progression bosses when the healing pattern isn't quite down, it generally adds up to about 2-3% mitigation and relatively often totally averts death 2 or 3 times a try.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>I downloaded the version...  interesting stuff.  I haven't run a raid since I tried it - just heroics.  <br>
<br>
AD is almost never coming into play according to it.  The few times it has, it's been in the middle of a bad pull where we wiped anyway.  <br>
<br>
It hasn't recorded a single death averted through AD.  Total playing time in heroics is probably about 12 hours at this point, through about 8 runs.<br>
<br>
Early days...  and I'd have to see it in a raid environment...  but if it continued like this, I'd question the usefulness of AD.<br>
<br>
Also...  the user interface...  would it be possible to have it present summary numbers for some period other than a single fight?  Or is that already in and I've just not done my homework?</div>

</div>We usually do that fight with 2-3 holy pallies, one of which is always solo-healing graved people.<br>
<br>
This sounds amazingly complex but it's really not once you see it in action.  You see it once and you're like "Oh, ok.".  The  entire strategy that we use basically boils down to OT's getting initial aggro over as many murlocs as possible.  Like I said, they don't pick all of them up nor do they hold them for a long time but it slows em up enough that even if murlocs do get through to a healer, it's only 1 -3 max per pack and they don't do enough damage to kill a healer, even if it's a priest.  And then, when they do get through, they only hit 1-2 times max before consecrate picks them up.<br>
<br>
Couple that with the fact that we position in him a place that causes the packs to get to the healers about 4-5 seconds apart and you have a situation where the damage on the healers is minimal if any.  Our healers never have to hold back, never have to aggro drop etc.  Hell, I think it's gotten to the point where they're TRYING to pull aggro on the murlocs :-)<br>
<br>
If it's a Warrior OT, they Thunderclap them then drag them back (This works extremely well).  If it's a druid, they swipe like crazy.  If it's a pally...  Do I have to even go over how they pick them up?  (We have two pally tanks.)<br>
<br>
<br>
The end result is that instead of 12 murlocs coming through and hitting a healer at once, 1-3 get through at once, MAX.  Our next morogrim kill, I will try to record it and post it for you all to see the strat in action.<br>
<br>
<br>
Edit:  I just noticed that you're from Sparda!  Holy tauren, I didn't think there were any other EJ-Loving protadins on our server.  Congrats on your guys' recent Kael and early MH kills!</div>

Ok I'm protect spec'd<br>
<br>
I stood in the cubby hole to the right of Morogrim. I had a warlock Life Tap his HP after Earthquake, I hit him up with some Holy Lights and the murlocs came directly towards me each time. Most after the 2nd heal, but definitely by the 3rd.<br>
<br>
Key here <br>
<br>
1. Have Righteous Fury activated<br>
2. All healers (except you) must have Blessing of Salvation<br>
3. No raid healing until Paladin has threat from Murlocs (Dedicate healers to MT for healing, can't let him die)<br>
<br>
When the murlocs are about 15yds away stop healing and use Consecration<br>
1. have Blessing of Sanc on<br>
2. Consecrate<br>
3. Holy shield<br>
<br>
Also the positioning is crucial, in my position both groups of Murlocs get to me with-in 3seconds of each other.<br>
<br>
I also put 2 pallies in my group, me with Imp Concentraion aura, another with Retribution aura, and a 3rd with Devo aura.<br>
<br>
After all murlocs are in the consecrate and it ticks for the full 8 secs, call for AOE nukes in. <br>
You should have ZERO problem holding aggro during this phase and I personally only needed 1 healer on me.<br>
Don't even bother whacking murlocs, spam consecrate and holy shield until they're dead<br>
<br>
<br>
This was my first time tanking them and our guild first kill of Morogrim. <br>
Protect Paladins truly make this easy.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Is there any hard and fast rule about how much block equals a certain amount of armor  in relation to effective health?  Like 200 armor equals 40 block value, or something like that.  I'm a bit unsure which rings i should be using.  I have the top tier Kara ring, the 2nd tier eternity ring, and the 7th ring of tirisfalen.  <br>
<br>
I am using the eternity and the 7th, but I'm wondering if the 391 armor on the great protector ring is worth more than the 24 block value and 24 block rating on the 7th.   Thoughts?   If not not on the ring choice, then the general question of armor vs. block value for effective health.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>My thoughts on this:<br>
<br>
Presuming you are near the 16k armor mark (I am on a couple hundred on either side of it depending on if I'm running Devotion Aura or not), then 391 armor is worth about 0.5% physical damage reduction (Math stolen from the Protection Warrior thread using that armor formula).<br>
<br>
Against adds (such as Embers of Al'ar) that hit plate for ~1000 (pre-block), then 0.5% reduction is 5 damage less per hit.  Even under the best buff situations, I run just under 50% avoidance (Miss, Dodge, Parry).  Presuming you are uncrushable, your Block Rating will come into effect on any attack that hits you.<br>
<br>
Given all that, against trash or adds, then 391 armor is worth about 5 Block Value.  This is, of course, presuming you have ~16k armor and the adds are hitting you for ~1k.<br>
<br>
Now, if we consider a boss who hits for 5k damage on plate, then 0.5% reduction from 391 armor is 25 damage less per hit, or the equivalent of 25 Block Value.<br>
<br>
Basically, the value of Block Value decreases compared to armor as the hits against you increase in damage (Block Value shows better returns against trash and adds than against bosses), but how much Armor equates to X amount of Block Value will also depend on your current armor value (as your armor value increases, a fixed bonus like 391 from the ring becomes less valuable).<br>
<br>
Apologies if I missed any math.<br>
<br>
So, personally, I'd choose the 7th Ring of the Tirisfalen over the Kara ring.</div>

</div>I'm sure its a rare thing, but we actually ran into a problem with the tank getting Healing Aggro on Tidewalker last week.  I can't find our logs to get the exact numbers, but basically the tank got two Earthshield healing crits and a Prayer of Mending proc milliseconds after the murlocs spawned.  The spawn from his end of the room (FLK side) entered melee range of him well before i could get significantly enough above his healing aggro to pull them to me.  The other group charged by me, and the few that got within melee range of me stuck to me (as i was within 30% of his heaing aggro), but that was enough to interrupt any further heals from me to try to rip the others all back to me.<br>
<br>
It was a bizarre series of luck that probably is likely to happen only very rarely, but there you have it.<br>
<br>
As a note: our Morogrim strategy is to tank him at the entrance to the FLK hallway, with the ranged (including Warlocks) near the top of his ramp.  I and my healer are at the bottom of his ramp (putting us out of Grave range).  I am constantly spamming Holy Light on the warlocks (canceling the casts at 0.5 sec left so as to not waste mana).  When an Earthquake hits, I let the Holy Light complete and then do another immediately on the next hurt Warlock.  I can cast 4 before murlocs hit me with the best timing, 3 being more typical.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Presuming you are near the 16k armor mark (I am on a couple hundred on either side of it depending on if I'm running Devotion Aura or not), then 391 armor is worth about 0.5% physical damage reduction (Math stolen from the Protection Warrior thread using that armor formula).</div>

	</tbody></table>
</div>It's a reduction of around 0.5% physical damage <i>relative to the unmitigated damage amount</i>.  But since you're basing your calculations on the damage after mitigation ("hits plate for ~1000") you need to look at the damage reduction relative to the that, which will be in the neighborhood of 1.2% I think.</div>

</div>Where are you guys at in progression?  Pally tanks really shine in SSC and TK.  Morogrim, Leotheras, Solarian and VR are all fights that are made easier by pally tanks to a certain degree.  The best thing to do is to let your actions speak louder than words and just kick ass at tanking.  Also, don't give pally tanks a bad name...  Have good attendance with your guild, don't throw fits when you're asked to heal, get the best possible out-of-raid gems/enchants/gears etc.<br>
<br>
My guild was the same way at first when we were just starting SSC.  I didn't push to respec to prot until we had enough holy pallies to replace my healing spot and until we were at bosses that it helped to have pally tanks on.  I was also a frequent visitor to these forums.  When it was time for me to respec, I had the gear, knowledge and a will to succeed.  I didn't disappoint them.<br>
<br>
I'm now our raid leader and GM and they couldn't trust in me or believe me more.  I've tanked most of everything in SSC and TK and having a pally tank for Morogrim, Leotheras and Solarian significantly enhanced our rate of progression.  We have never done Leo without me tanking Human form and our FR warrior tanking demon form for example.<br>

Also, since Blessing of Sanctuary and Reckoning are both fairly deep into the protection tree, i would say that prot is very much superior to holy.

</div>As far as progression, we just downed Tidewalker yesterday. The guild tried to do tidewalker without a protection paladin, and they could not do it. Once i got pulled in, we were able to down him - even though the gear of my pally is not even T4.  I do my best not to give tankadins a bad name - after all, if i did it would reduce people's confidence in me as well.  I'll do my best to kick ass at tanking - I'm desperately working on better gear and i'm on these forums every day to make sure i do not miss any new technique or general knowledge that would make tanking an encounter successful. Thanks for the advice! </div>

</div>Hello fellow Gilneas peep.  Sparda actually rocks 2 prot-specced pallies now, which kicks ass.  My guild's determined that a prot spec pally is basically required for TW, Al'ar, and I think Kael, which means I can take vacations without killing the guild.<br>
<br>

		<div id="post_message_571028">I came upon this thread about a week or so ago (first time visitor to elitistjerks) and I am delighted by the vast wealth of intelligent discussion going on here. My guild mate Firebrandt on my server has been prot since the beginning of time, and I've recently respecced now that the number of holy paladins in my guild allows me a little more freedom. The two of us have more or less worked out most of what we know on our own, so it's great to read this thread and find out a) we got a lot of stuff right (even by accident) and b) there's a lot we hadn't even thought of. That said there are a few questions that I've been puzzling over:<br>
<br>
Whats the point of taking Benediction? Is there any reason at all for Tankadins to have Mp5 (outside of 5 mans)? Whats the point of the t6 2-piece set bonus?<br>
<br>
I've seen many pallies post builds in this thread that included benediction, and the criticism they received was always directed elsewhere (at anticipation or reckoning for example, but never benediction). It seems to me that if you're tanking any sort of raid content you're taking enough damage and getting enough heals to sustain any spells you would want to cast. For the most part our mana expenditure has a cap set by our cooldowns. Given the "worst" case scenario, where we're casting every threat spell we have exactly when the cooldown is up (ideal, I know) we have:<br>
 82.5 mps: Consecrate (660 mana, 8 second CD)<br>
 28.0 mps: Holy Shield (280 mana, 10 sec CD)<br>
 73.3 mps: Hammer of Wrath (440 mana, 6 sec CD)<br>
 22.7 mps: Exorcism (340 mana, 15 sec CD)<br>
 18.4 mps: Judgement (147 mana*, 8 second CD**)<br>
 32.5 mps: Seal of Righteousness (250 mana, cast every 8 seconds)<br>
------------<br>
257.4 mps expenditure<br>
<br>
*I'm human, the base mana pool for other races may vary slightly and thus the cost of judgement.<br>
**Improved, which increases mps expenditure.<br>
<br>
So in order to sustain that with SA alone, you would need to suffer 2574 DPS (and the healing required to survive). Now I only have Karazhan experience as a tank so far (GL experience as a healer), but it seems to me like that isn't too unimaginable. You could of course increase your mps expenditure by casting Avenger's Shield every 30 seconds (but who does that?) or casting more than one seal per judgement (as I do frequently, but not regularly). I read earlier in this post about buffs (notably seals) causing threat, do people spam seals every GCD when they are between CDs? Even then, there would still be cap, albeit a bit higher. I haven't clocked yet the dps I take from raid bosses, but another tank told be he was taking 1300-1600 from GL trash, and it seems things would only hit harder from then on.<br>
<br>
In reality, our mana expenditure is much lower, and we require much less damage to sustain it. Things like lag, targets being above 20%, and targets being non-undead decrease the amount of spells available to us to burn our mana. In Karazhan I can cast LoH with impunity because a few seconds later I'm back at half mana again. How does the mana expenditure increase as the content becomes more difficult in order to warrant that T6 two-piece set bonus?</div>

</div>If I recall my mechanics correctly, the threat generated by PoM and Earthshield's heals are attributed to the person that got healed, instead of the Priest/Shaman that cast the buff.<br>
<br>
The same holds true for Lifebloom's Bloom effect when dispelled or expired, although the individual ticks still generate threat for the Druid.<br>
<br>
I agree though that it might be better to just call off all heals completely.<br>
<br>
@teflamreilavehc: I believe we need Benediction to access tier 2-3 of the Ret tree. Even if your raid does not have a completely PvE specced Holydin to provide Improved BoMight and even if your raid has enough physical DPS to justify the relatively marginal AP bonus of talented over untalented BoM, at the end of the day you're still not using it for tanking, which makes it more of a waste than Benediction providing excess mana.</div>

		<div id="post_message_571363">There's really not a lot we can do to help our offtanking. <br>
<br>
If we're not being hit, we lose all of the threat from Ret Aura and Holy Shield. We're not getting damaged either, which means Consecration is unsustainable without the mana return from SA.<br>
<br>
Some options though:<br>
<br>
1. Ask to be the MT - Warriors, and to a greater extend Druids make better offtanks than us because they generate rage (which they later translate into threat) via white hits, in addition to the fact that their threat-generating abilities do not rely on being hit themselves. <br>
<br>
If you're on Gruul and there's only 2 of you, ask to MT Gruul - your DPS might be threat-capped far too much by letting you be the Hateful Strike tank.<br>
<br>
Similarly, ask to be first-up on VR. Who knows, he might never come off :P<br>
<br>
2. Heal/DPS - We are of course hybrids, and just as Ret Paladins are at times asked to help tank Hyjal trash waves, so can we strap on our healing/skull-cracking for the raid's greater good.<br>
<br>
3. Chug pots - If there's just no way around it, drink those Super Manas like water and hope for the best. This isn't so bad for Gruul where you can make significant tradeoffs in terms of tank stats in order to maximize your spell damage/mana longevity, but for fights like VR where you can still expect to actually do some tanking, it can definitely get expensive.<br>
<br>
As a fourth option, I've also been toying around with the idea of going with a Warrior-item-heavy setup and using Seal of Blood in conjunction. Maximize our self-inflicted (as opposed to reflected) damage, gain some SA mana regen from SoB's self-damage and hope for the best.</div>

		<div id="post_message_571411">Whilst I agree our offtanking capabilities are limited it's not quite as bad as some make out.<br>
Some people will swear blind that a paladin cannot OT Gruul and yet I have done it a number of times (before 2.3, haven't been to visit him since). Yes, I often had to use mana pots and did go with extra spelldamge food/elixirs, but my gear stayed the same as it would for any other boss. Using SoVengeance helps, as it still ticks during the shatter, as does using Avenger's Shield straight after shatter, before you run back into range - you have to be quick on it though, or one of your melee may take the strike instead.<br>
<br>
I agree on Void Reaver, our job is much easier if we go in first, but again it's not all woe if you lose aggro - the constant poundings tend to give you sufficient mana to keep max rank consecration up and again I'll use SoVengeance, judging every 10 seconds. I'll use Avenger's Shield when mana allows and Avenging Wrath when it's available again (use it on the pull) but making sure I have a decent amount of mana ready to make full use of it.<br>
<br>
At Tidewalker I tank murlocs, and while the guild have done it without me - 2 other paladins cross healing each other for aggro I believe - it's much smoother when I'm there. We tank Tidewalker in the doorway of the tunnel to Karathress's room and I stand at the base of the ramp, near his initial spawn point. Ranged dps and healers stand at the top of the ramp, at max range to Tidewalker, but in range and line of sight to me. In this position I avoid all watery graves, due to LoS or range and am at the point where both sets of murlocs will arrive at me at the same time as they run in from the opposite ends of the room. Usually have 1 holy paladin assigned to heal me, and he tops off the people coming out of the graves too. if we're short on warlocks then we have one lifetap so I can get 3 holy lights on him, if not I just have 3 warlocks set as player targets in oRA2 and hit each one with a max rank holy light as soon as the earthquake happens. Unless another healer has been silly and hit PoH or let a full stack lifebloom expire on the tank, then all the murlocs come to me every time. 2 or 3 consecrates while the aoe comes in and wait for next earthquake.<br>
<br>
The tricky part comes once he's under 25% and we move into the tunnel fully, as then one set of murlocs is on us almost immediately after earthquake, meaing I don't get time for the healing aggro moves, and instead have to rely on consecrate alone with liberal use of taunts and BoP from all the paladins.<br>
<br>
----<br>
<br>
In my build I've taken 3/3 pursuit of justice for the increased chance for spell misses and was wondering about others experiences on with it?<br>
Biggest place I have noticed a difference is while tanking the adds at Al'ar - I seem to get hit less by the explosions when the birds die, making it much easier for me to position for the next one. I did also think it was affecting fears, but then at Vashj attmpts last night I don't think I resisted a single one from the striders (we're still learning to kite them properly) so now I'm not so sure.</div>

</div><br>
300 Spell Damage is not quite enough for TK and some parts of ZA.  When I started tanking, I would use high-spelldamage pieces even if they were not plate or even designed for tanking.  For example, on Morogrim on our first kills I used the big bad wolf's helm from Karazhan and the boots from heroic BF.  I would later switch to using the boots from Heroic SH, wrists from Heroic Arc and belt from Heroic BM.<br>
<br>
Taking a look at your gear, you are wearing a lot of "Warrior" gear.  Wrynn Dynasty Greaves, Battlescar Boots, Crimson Girdle, your wrists, helm etc are all designed primarily for warriors and as such you're losing out on stats that pallies need like SpellDamage and Intellect.<br>
<br>
The biggest upgrade that you can get is your weapon.  If you can, grinding out the arena points to get the S2 Mace would be a HUGE upgrade.  That alone would give you 100 spelldamage.  The rest of the additional spelldamage that you will need should come in the form of Tier gear and the excellent badge rewards for pallies.  The tier 5 legs are a nice upgrade but obviously won't come until you're deep into SSC.  I would still acquire the rest of your Tier 4 set except for the chest, even if it's for high-threat/offtanking purposes.  Running Heroic SH (EZMODE), Heroic Arc and Heroic BM will give you some very nice pally tanking off-set items in the form of wrists, boots and a belt.  They have less avoidance and stamina than warrior equivalents but stamina and mitigation/avoidance mean squat if you can't hold aggro!<br>
<br>
<br>
Beyond that, get creative with your damage rotations.  For example, when I am offtanking I will wear my high-threat gear and wait for my Al'Ar trinket to proc (290 extra spelldamage).  I'll then pop avenging wrath and start stacking Seal Of Vengeance on the mob.  Using this method, I've had 5 stacks of SoV tick for more than 500 damage.  That's ~300 TPS if I don't do anything.  Factor in white damage and SoV 5-stack hits and it ends up being 500 TPS by just swinging my weapon with SoV on.  Factor in judgements which hit way harder than SoR judgements as well as consecrate and avenger's shield and you can do a LOT of threat OTing.<br>
<br>
I know that you are a blood elf and cannot do this but I was just trying to give you an example.  As a previous poster also said, you will need to chug mana pots.  This is kind of unfortunate but it's just how pally tanks work.  I chug mana pots on more or less every boss fight.<br>
<br>
<br>
The biggest thing that you need to do is build up a "High-threat" suit of gear for OTing.  Shoot for more than 500 spelldamage buffed and once you get to that point, shoot for 600 spelldamage buffed.  This is a lot easier than it seems as long as you put in the effort to get the gear.  Run those heroics!!  You need both the rewards from Heroic SH, Heroic BM and Heroic Arc as well as the badge rewards.</div>

		<div id="post_message_571599">I pretty much disagree with most of the comments about Off-tanking paladins.<br>
<br>
IMO if a paladin is being counted on to tank any 25 man boss, they should be Main Tank. Examples would be Gruul, Void Reaver, Al'ar. (not specific fights such as Hydross).<br>
<br>
I have fairly nice Protection Paladin gear. <br>
<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302181755/http://armory.worldofwarcraft.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Medivh&amp;n=Gunn" target="_blank">Armory Link</a><br>
<br>
I'm wearing the gear I used to tank the Al'ar adds, ATM so don't freak out when you see it. I'll log out with the correct gear tonight.<br>
<br>
Paladins gain Threat and Mana from being hit<br>
Blessing of Sanctuary<br>
Retribution Aura<br>
Holy Shield<br>
<br>
The only threat they can gain otherwise is<br>
Consecration<br>
Judgements<br>
Seals<br>
Avengers Shield<br>
<br>
Now people will argue here, but the fact is. <u>If you have any DPSERS worth their salt</u>. There is <b>NO WAY</b> you're going to be able to get enough threat without being the FIRST in Rotation on Main Tanking. Except when Taunting is possible<br>
<br>
Believe me I have tried and it is VERY difficult and extremely mana intensive to even try. If you're geared to tank the boss, you should go first. It's that simple. If you do not go first your chances for success have been diminished greatly.<br>
<br>
Go first ONE time on the Void Reaver fight and you will see how impressive our threat generation is Main Tanking a boss and anyone in your guild that has an issue with you being first in Main Tanking rotation probably has an ego problem</div>

</div>Please stop saying that paladins need intellect. This isn't just you; this is the entire world. Stop saying it. It's just not true. If you're OT you don't need it either; you're still going to go OOM with a bigger mana pool, you'll just do it in 20 seconds instead of 10. Honestly, paladin healing gear is better in that case, since it has boatloads of mp5 which might be useful. If you're the OT, I think that you'll need to give yourself BoW if you don't have it normally, make sure you've judged wisdom and chug and chug. <br>
<br>
I think that alliance paladins can get away sometimes with OTing thanks to SoV. I think it's pretty much impossible for BElfs, though using SoB and forcing heals to come your way isn't the worst idea ever floated out there.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I pretty much disagree with most of the comments about Off-tanking paladins.<br>
<br>
IMO if a paladin is being counted on to tank any 25 man boss, they should be Main Tank. Examples would be Gruul, Void Reaver, Al'ar. (not specific fights such as Hydross).<br>
...<br>
Now people will argue here, but the fact is. <u>If you have any DPSERS worth their salt</u>. There is <b>NO WAY</b> you're going to be able to get enough threat without being the FIRST in Rotation on Main Tanking. Except when Taunting is possible<br>
<br>
Believe me I have tried and it is VERY difficult and extremely mana intensive to even try. If you're geared to tank the boss, you should go first. It's that simple. If you do not go first your chances for success have been diminished greatly.<br>
...anyone in your guild that has an issue with you being first in Main Tanking rotation probably has an ego problem</div>

	</tbody></table>
</div>I absolutely disagree.  <br>
<br>
A) I'm not the _best_ geared tank in my guild.  I'm arguably the 2nd best at this point in time, but for a while was 3rd-4th.  Sometimes this is just the way it is.  I'm not going to insist that I main tank something just because it's hard for me to off-tank.  News-flash, it's hard for warriors to generate rage when they're not getting hit as well.  It's not an ego thing, I'm just simply not as well-geared.  This matters less on something like VR, where you're gonna have to tank at some point, but on Gruul?  There was no way I was gonna MT him so our extremely well geared warrior could be there to just take hurtful strikes.<br>
<br>
B) It's not easy, but it's hardly impossible to Off-tank.  And you really don't need more than 300ish spell damage to do so.  First, it takes some practice.  The first couple of times I did VR, my aggro was awful.  I didn't pot correctly, didn't time my spells correctly - and with VR, if you don't get aggro fast enough, you can't regen enough mana through SA to sustain your cycles.  Gruul is almost comically easy, as there's pretty much damage happening all the time.  Judge crusader, burn your wings and use seal of vengeance if you're alliance(if you're a BE, I'm pretty sure you should be using SoB in threat-starved situations - but I'm not a BE so I'm not certain).  Your main concern will be potting early (before the Hurtful Strikes become meaningful), and not pulling aggro off the tank.  Don't be afraid to stand in a cave in or two to start either, your healers will still be rather bored at this point and won't have any issues healing you up.<br>
<br>
C) I really can't agree with jasura and the spell damage outfit while sacrificing plate (read: armor), and defensive stats.  I think we've always got to remember that we're tanks, and are expected to not be squishy.  I have outfits that'll put me pretty high up in holy damage, but all the times I've tried them I've taken far too much damage for my own liking.  If you're dead, it doesn't matter how much threat you're generating.</div>

</div>I don't think it should be a necessity to blow through 8 pots in a boss fight just because you're being made to Off-tank. My point is, If the Paladin can do the job and do it well, then they should go first. We build threat faster, we build it better, and ultimately it helps everyone for us to go in first.<br>
<br>
Now if you can't handle MTing the boss because of gear/experience/inability that's one thing. I'm no where near suggesting that you should demand being MT just because you're a paladin.<br>

<br>
Hunter<br>
--------<br>
<i>Prefered Spec: Beastmaster</i><br>
Ferocious Inspiration (+TPS)<br>
Trueshot Aura (+TPS)<br>
<br>
<br>
Going from the list, shamans obviously win out. Totem of Wrath is 3% spell hit and 3% spell crit, Wrath of Air +100 spell damage, and helps you stay alive. Even without an elemental spec shaman, you would want a shaman in your tank party. Warrior and Warlock offer you 79 stamina and 1350 hp from commanding shout.<br>
<br>
So your tank party looks like:<br>
Paladin<br>
Warrior<br>
Shaman<br>
Warlock<br>
<br>
Now you have to choose: <br>
A druid OT would get similar benefits from most totems and the hit points, but offers no real tangible buff for you.<br>
A Paladin offers mitigation and, if spec'd, a 10% holy damage and 2% all damage boost.<br>
A Beastmaster Hunter offers 3% Damage, which translates to 3% threat<br>
A Shadow Priest offers hit points and mana regen, but you should be covered with potions and Spiritual attunement on bosses<br>
-SP are excellent for trash and Off-tanking, however, since paladin mana pools drain fast when not tanking<br>
A Shaman, in addition to the previous, can offer 4 more totems and a second blood lust.<br>
<br>
Optimal fifth spot in descending order:<br>
Paladin (Retribution or spec'd holy)<br>
Shaman<br>
Beastmaster Hunter<br>
Shadow Priest<br>
Druid<br>
<br>
A mage offers absolutely no benefits in your party.</div>

</div>If you're geared such that you're having trouble getting threat, then you're either not aware of how to gear properly, or are going to be a lot harder to keep up when you switch gear.  Or, you're just not trying hard enough, which leads to your second quote:<br>

</div>First off, the longest fight that you have to chain-pot throughout is VR, which has a 10 min enrage, putting you at 5 mana pots.  Not the end of the world.  Secondly, you only have to down mana pots for a very select few fights.  Nowadays, I only use them for VR, sometimes Al'ar and sometimes TW.  Here and there on KT too.<br>
<br>
Additionally, I think it's very rare for a guild to have more than 1-2 MTs.  If you're one of these, then go ahead and ask to go first.  If not, I've personally noticed that there's a psychological advantage to having your *MT* start the fight.  The DPS and healers tend to be very comfortable with how they perform, and tend to do better because of it.  This alone is enough for me not to ever demand that I go first, and often I'd rather sit in the back and heal if that's an option.  Saves my mana pots .<br>

</div>I don't get why you're wearing what you're currently wearing.  I highly doubt your dps is _THAT_ good(i.e. BT and Hyjal gear while you're rocking Kara epics), such that you need to output that kind of threat.  Those birds hit me, with 16k armor, for around 900-1k.  Say they're hitting you for 1k.  Your avoidance(or rather, lack thereof) means you're getting hit fully far more often than not.  You're not max defense, so you're often getting hit for 1.5k instead.  You have less than 10k hp buffed, which prolly means somewhere around 13k fully buffed.  Basically you're a bad sequence of crit hits and an explosion away from dying, for no apparent reason.  Do you tank more than one add?<br>
<br>
I guess what I don't understand is why you're not using the strengths of a protection paladin to your advantage.  There's no way you can tank many multiple mobs in that.  Al'ar is a great fight for a prot pally because it's super easy to hold many adds with "free" damage done to them till phase 2, and it's easy to just off-tank a number of adds to speed up the end of the fight.  Have you tried running with ~400 damage and actual tank gear?  You could prolly do the same strat, substitute a dps for that extra healer you're requiring, and have an immensly easier kill.<br>
<br>
Prot pallies aren't major damage dealers in raids, nor should we be - we're tanks.  If you have enough threat to hold your target, any extra is wasted, and could be used toward survival.</div>

That said, I agree with most of your choices.  The thing that you're kind of glossing over is the relative merit of each threat/mitigation gain, especially because you're going to have an OT (or be an OT).  Our per-gain threat is almost identical with WF and WoA (in fact, past a certain level of +dam, WF is more), and the rest of the raid is going to benefit more from the ele shaman being in the caster dps group (so no ToW).  I also find that putting a druid into that group is a pretty bad idea (better to toss them in with the hunters) unless they franticly need the extra HP boost.</div>

It shouldn't matter what order you run in to a boss paladins are hands down the fastest threat building tanking class.  For fights like VR it is possible to sacrifice tanking gear for spell damage gear.  If you do decide to sac some tanking gear make sure you have the health pool to support yourself.  Other fights where spell damage gear might serve you better then straight tanking is Hydross / Tidewalker / Solarian / Leotharas.  If you aren't generating enough threat w/o using holyshield/ret aura then maybe it's your playstyle or spec, or your gear might not be up to par just yet.</div>

I also find that putting a druid into that group is a pretty bad idea (better to toss them in with the hunters) unless they franticly need the extra HP boost.

I'm also not sure what 'stuns' you mean when referring to grounding totem? If my memory serves me well, we only used grounding in g1 in SSC for direct damage attacks and havent used it for the MT past that.  <i>edit: horrible memory it is. See next post.</i><br>

You can probably get the drift of what I'm saying.  When I'm OT'ing, I end up as not quite as indestructible as when MT'ing, so the odds of a wipe if the MT goes down go up a bit.  I also find I have to be careful at times not to pull agro from the MT.  There is a point of spell damage gear where this becomes an issue for me, so its a matter of finding the right balance of offsets.<br>
<br>
Basically...  when I'm main tank I generate more agro so need less spell damage and all the heals keep my mana pool in good shape.  Also, as MT the emphasis needs to be on surviving, so armor and stam etc. become king.<br>
<br>
As off-tank, the gear switches to maximizing spell damage and preserving/maintaining the mana pool within the context of 490 defence and uncrushable.<br>
<br>
Because of the silence...  Gruul is not a good fit for prot pali's.  I've done both MT and OT on him, but if a warrior and druid tanks are both present, I expect to be healing this fight.<br>
<br>
I use SoV a lot on OT'ing situations.  I find it to be more mana-efficient than SoR.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I absolutely disagree.  <br>
<br>
A) I'm not the _best_ geared tank in my guild.  I'm arguably the 2nd best at this point in time, but for a while was 3rd-4th.  Sometimes this is just the way it is.  I'm not going to insist that I main tank something just because it's hard for me to off-tank.  News-flash, it's hard for warriors to generate rage when they're not getting hit as well.  It's not an ego thing, I'm just simply not as well-geared.  This matters less on something like VR, where you're gonna have to tank at some point, but on Gruul?  There was no way I was gonna MT him so our extremely well geared warrior could be there to just take hurtful strikes.<br>
<br>
B) It's not easy, but it's hardly impossible to Off-tank.  And you really don't need more than 300ish spell damage to do so.  First, it takes some practice.  The first couple of times I did VR, my aggro was awful.  I didn't pot correctly, didn't time my spells correctly - and with VR, if you don't get aggro fast enough, you can't regen enough mana through SA to sustain your cycles.  Gruul is almost comically easy, as there's pretty much damage happening all the time.  Judge crusader, burn your wings and use seal of vengeance if you're alliance(if you're a BE, I'm pretty sure you should be using SoB in threat-starved situations - but I'm not a BE so I'm not certain).  Your main concern will be potting early (before the Hurtful Strikes become meaningful), and not pulling aggro off the tank.  Don't be afraid to stand in a cave in or two to start either, your healers will still be rather bored at this point and won't have any issues healing you up.<br>
<br>
C) I really can't agree with jasura and the spell damage outfit while sacrificing plate (read: armor), and defensive stats.  I think we've always got to remember that we're tanks, and are expected to not be squishy.  I have outfits that'll put me pretty high up in holy damage, but all the times I've tried them I've taken far too much damage for my own liking.  If you're dead, it doesn't matter how much threat you're generating.</div>

</div><br>
Even if I was wearing a few non-tank items, I was taking less damage than the healers who otherwise would've ended up tanking the murlocs.  At that time, I didn't have my T4 helm and was using eternium greathelm.  Going from Eternium to the Big Bad Wolf's helm gave me like 60-70 more spelldamage.  Going from my Chess Event boots to the Mail boots gave me a huge spelldamage increase as well.  I also had a shammy in my group for the spelldamage increase.  Holding aggro on the mobs was my number one concern.  Through better gearing, I now no longer even have to make major gear changes for particular fights.  I may switch some pieces up but since I have more than 500 spelldamage and 21k hp buffed, threat nor HP are a concern.  What I am trying to say is to gear specifically for the fight until you vastly overgear it.<br>
<br>
<b>I really cannot stress this enough</b> - Mitigation or Avoidance means NOTHING if the mob is not hitting you.  Using gear and gems in-game, you can get a tank to be near unhittable.  I supposed that if you REALLY push for max avoidance, they could reach complete immunity from normal physical damage.  Would this be good for a warrior or druid?  No, because they would never generate enough rage.  They would then lose aggro and the warlock with 10% avoidance and 10% mitigation would then be tanking...  And he wouldn't do so well .  The same could be said about a pally because they would probably have little to no spelldamage with the same gear and quickly go oom from lack of SA mana.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Please stop saying that paladins need intellect. This isn't just you; this is the entire world. Stop saying it. It's just not true. If you're OT you don't need it either; you're still going to go OOM with a bigger mana pool, you'll just do it in 20 seconds instead of 10. Honestly, paladin healing gear is better in that case, since it has boatloads of mp5 which might be useful. If you're the OT, I think that you'll need to give yourself BoW if you don't have it normally, make sure you've judged wisdom and chug and chug. <br>
<br>
I think that alliance paladins can get away sometimes with OTing thanks to SoV. I think it's pretty much impossible for BElfs, though using SoB and forcing heals to come your way isn't the worst idea ever floated out there.</div>

How much 25-man raid tanking have you actually done Kalbear?  I see the pally intellect argument being the same as the intellect argument for druid tanks...  It's not something that you go out of your way for but it comes on the gear because you need a small amount of it.  As a pally tank, the more intellect you have, the more mana you have and the earlier that you can pot without wasting some of the mana pot.  That means that you can pot again earlier before you go OOM and generally go OOM slower.  Yes, you will still go OOM, but it will happen slower.  Plus, I go OOM on every single 5-man and 10-man, especially trash pulls.  Heroic SH?  I'm OOM after almost every single pull and there's of course no CC being done.<br>
<br>
Pallies need pally gear either way.  Try holding aggro wearing all off-set warrior items from T5 / T6 instances and see how miserably you would fail.  Different tanks need different stats.  The tier sets for pallies are usually lacking in stats in comparison to warrior equivalents but you still need them or you'll simply go oom too fast and/or not hold aggro.  I wouldn't make intellect alone a sole deciding factor between item choice but whether or not the item is actually designed for pally tanks does need to be considered.  For example:  I think that <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33522" target="_blank">Chestguard of the Stoic Guardian - Items - World of Warcraft</a> is way better for tankadins than <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29066" target="_blank">Justicar Chestguard - Items - World of Warcraft</a>.  Even though you lose 30 int, it is still an all-around upgrade for pally tanks.  Likewise, the first BP is better than  <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33473" target="_blank">Chestguard of the Warlord - Items - World of Warcraft</a></div>

I guess what I don't understand is why you're not using the strengths of a protection paladin to your advantage.  There's no way you can tank many multiple mobs in that.  Al'ar is a great fight for a prot pally because it's super easy to hold many adds with "free" damage done to them till phase 2, and it's easy to just off-tank a number of adds to speed up the end of the fight.  Have you tried running with ~400 damage and actual tank gear?  You could prolly do the same strat, substitute a dps for that extra healer you're requiring, and have an immensly easier kill.<br>
<br>
Prot pallies aren't major damage dealers in raids, nor should we be - we're tanks.  If you have enough threat to hold your target, any extra is wasted, and could be used toward survival.</div>

	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Well the simple answer is "I am using the strengths of the protection pally to my advantage" which is precisely why I'm wearing that gear for the Al'ar fight. <br>
<br>
I'm tanking the adds. I draw the adds by Healing aggro. Once they get to me I build up threat and folks DPS them down. The faster I get my threat up the quicker they can attack. I was wearing protect full gear the first couple times and I was running out of mana quickly. I wasn't gaining it back fast enough from heals because I was barely being hurt except on explosions, which only take about 7k damage. As long as I'm not in flame patches and we don't kill 2 Adds at the same time I'm good to go. THusly the gear I had on worked very well for me on Al'ar Adds.<br>
<br>
If you look at my gear I have on currently. It's more normal gear for tanking</div>

</div>I've not done any 25-man offtanking; this is from the heroic/normal system. If I'm not getting hit, I'll go OOM after about 4 cycles of threat. <br>
<br>
I can't see your point about being able to pot sooner. The mana usage doesn't vary depending on your pool size. Neither does the mana you get back from the pot. If you spend 3000 mana, it doesn't matter if you have 4000 or 40,000. You'll still gain back that 3000, and you can still use it just as fast. I suppose if you had a mana pool where the pool size was actually smaller than a mana pot's return, this might be an issue...but to my knowledge the base mana at 70 is well over any mana pot's regen ability. <br>
<br>
If you have 1000 more mana, that means you'll get one cast of consecrate, SoR and judge. That's it. That's what, a 10-second cycle? Let me put it this way - if you go OOM on every 5 man and 10 man pull with spiritual attunement, why do you think that intellect is going to help you at all when doing OTing for 6 minutes?<br>
<br>
You can't help but get some int on gear. But you don't need it, it's certainly not something you should go out of your way to acquire, and (most importantly) intellect does not help at all from going OOM as an off-tank.<br>

I'm not arguing that paladins need warrior gear over pally gear. I'm arguing that they do not need intellect. Which they don't; the int is basically wasted itemization. <br>

</div>Right, but we're talking offtanking. Now, are you talking about tanking adds or actually being 2nd in aggro? If it's the latter, you have to assume that you're going to be hit as well. Being second on the aggro list means nothing if you'll die when you get hit. I can see an argument that you should switch gear if the MT goes down, but that causes all sorts of issues in combat; trinket cooldowns, GCD triggering, etc. And you're still struggling to actually stay 2nd on the aggro list.<br>

Say you're going through 1,800 Mana per minute after SA mana gain, in-combat MP5 from wisdom etc...  So every two minutes you burn through 3,600 Mana.<br>
<br>
Assume tankadin A has 7,000 Mana.  Assume Tankadin B has 5,500 Mana.  Assume that you are using large mana pots that restore 1,800 - 3,000 Mana on a two minute cooldown, making for 2,400 mana average per mana pot.<br>
<br>
After 80 seconds, both tanks will have lost 2,400 mana and will Pot.  They are both up to full mana.  <br>
120 seconds later, they will pot again.  Tank A has 5,800 mana.  Tank B has 4,300 mana.<br>
120 seconds later, Mana Pot.  Tank A has 4,600 Mana, Tank B has 3,100 mana.<br>
103 seconds later, Tank B goes OOM.  This happens exactly 423 seconds into the fight.<br>
17 seconds later, Mana Pot.  Tank A has 3,400 mana.<br>
113 seconds later, Tank A goes OOM.  This happens exactly 553 seconds into the fight.<br>
<br>
<br>
In this example, Tank A lasted for approximately 130.73% as long as Tank B, with 127.27% more mana.  Depending on how quickly you gain mana and how quickly you lose mana, you may get a bigger or smaller gain from having more mana but the point remains that the more mana you have, the longer you last, even with Mana pot chugging.  I can't think of a single boss that I tank that hits me hard enough that I don't have to worry about mana potting so this is important.<br>
<br>
This example is NOT factoring in that if Tank A has more mana and the tanks have gear of equivalent item level, Tank A will probably have less mitigation/avoidance than Tank B and as such will take more damage.  This means more healing and more mana regen through SA.  This is a side effect that is hard to measure but makes a big difference in realistic scenarios.  <br>
<br>
Almost all OT fights where taunt isn't allowed have some sort of incoming damage to the tanks to help recoup mana/rage starvation so this is important.  On Gruul, you have hurtful strike or whatever it's called.  On VR, you have pounding.  On al'ar, you can taunt so threat while OTing isn't important.  On Leo, you're taking damage half of the time and the other half you can white hit to build rage (Druid/warr) or judge wisdom and swing away if you're a pally.  Vashj is tauntable.  Did I miss any fights where tank swapping is sometimes necessary pre BT/Hyjal?<br>
<br>
My experience is only up to SSC/TK so I am not sure about BT/Hyjal bosses.  I know that Gurtogg requires some tank swapping but also know that OT's will have stacks of his dot on them for a lot of the time.  Either way, my point remains that more mana does make you go OOM slower.  It won't prevent it but let's take a look at our example...  What if the fights lasts 423 seconds long?  The extra mana is completely useless.  If it lasts 553 seconds?  It can be the difference between a kill and a wipe because the tank went OOM and lost aggro.<br>
<br>
What it comes down to is this:<br>
<br>
"Pallies cast spells to generate aggro.  Spells require mana.  Mana comes from intellect.  No mana = no aggro.  No aggro = you've become a 100 dps paladin with a lot of HP."<br>
<br>
<br>
Otherwise, I agree with most of your points Kalbear.  Intellect isn't something that you go out of your way to get or socket/enchant your gear to get.  Every fight is situational.  If you're taking enough damage that the mana regen is greater than your mana output...  Hell yes, a larger mana pool is useless.  I just haven't found this to be the case on nearly every mob I've ever tanked and find myself going OOM in combat sometimes with my mana pot on CD.</div>

</div>It's not that simple; it's a system with inflow and outflow.  When OT'ing, you're spending mana on SoR/JoR, consecration, and AS.  You're also gaining mana from BoW, healing from any incidental damage you take (e.g., VR pounding), chugging mana pots, possibly JoW, and possibly other sources like a shadow priest or totem.<br>
<br>
From these, you can figure out the net rate at which you're gaining or (more likely) losing mana.  If you're spending a net 1000 mana per minute offtanking, then 1000 more mana means you can keep up your full threat cycle one minute longer, which may very well be the difference between getting Voidreaver's aggro back and not.  It certainly has for me on more than one occasion.<br>
<br>
This doesn't apply strictly to offtanking situations either.  For me, tanking Al'ar adds is usually a negative net mana-flow proposition, even when chug pots and eat all the explosions, etc.  By the end of the fight I'm often low on mana or out of mana, so that's a place where having a bit more intellect helps as well.<br>
<br>
Intellect-free gear is great when you're MT'ing something that's hitting fast and hard, but it's problematic in a lot of other situations.</div>

		<div id="post_message_573151">Okay, I understand better what you're saying. I disagree; I think that more stamina/spelldamage would be better than more intellect most of the time, but I can see it applying in some cases. <br>
<br>
I also don't think that coming up with hypothetical cases is particularly useful; for instance, the 7000 mana vs. 5500 mana is another +100 intellect, and you're assuming that that +100 int didn't go somewhere else useful for itemization. It doesn't factor in the ability to maintain aggro with higher spelldamage by downranking. But I'll leave it be. One last thing though:<br>

	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>In your above example, it doesn't mean that the tank went OOM for the entire encounter. It means that they're not gaining as much as they need to use max rank abilities at all times. They still will get a pot 17 seconds after they go OOM, for instance, and presumably they'll still be regenerating mana. Let's not exaggerate things entirely; they're not  going to be doing white damage for the next 2 minutes and twiddling their thumbs while the other tank would be at full blast. They just won't be putting out as much damage in that time.<br>
<br>
Assuming they didn't turn that int into something more useful, that is.</div>

</div>No.  Mana comes from incoming damage.<br>

Intellect is just about as relevant a stat for us as it is for shadow priests, whose mana comes from outgoing damage.  <br>

If you want more mana, figure out a way to take more damage without creating more lethal spikes.</div>

		<div id="post_message_573224">This thread makes me sad due to the lack of numbers and facts, and the huge amount of conjecture and pure ranting.<br>
<br>
Offtanking:  My offtanking threat rotation is 8 seconds.  This particular setup is using no damage consumables.<br>
<br>
JoR averages 808 damage<br>
Consecration is 207 damage per second or 1656 damage per cycle<br>
SoR does 180 damage per 1.8 seconds or 800 damage per cycle<br>
Melee does 98 damage average or 435 damage per cycle.<br>
<br>
With precision and no hit rating you have 6% chance to miss.  With weapon Expertise you have ~3.5% chance to be dodged/parried.  So we will take 10% off the melee swings.<br>
<br>
With precision and no spell hit rating you have 14% chance to miss, so we will take that off of JoR.<br>
<br>
JoR = 808*.86 = 695<br>
Con = 1656 = 1656<br>
SoR = 800*.9 = 720<br>
Melee = 435*.9 = 392<br>
<br>
Calculating threat:<br>
<br>
JoR = 695*1.9 = 1321<br>
Cons = 1656*.9 = 3146<br>
SoR = 720*1.9 = 1368<br>
Melee = 392<br>
<br>
Total = 6227 / 8 = 778.37 TPS<br>
<br>
Consider Avenging Wrath: 20 seconds with 3 minute cooldown.<br>
<br>
Under Avenging Wrath you're doing 778.37*1.3 = 1011 TPS.<br>
<br>
Mana Use:<br>
SoR = 260 * .85 = 221<br>
JoR = 145 * .85 = 123<br>
Cons = 660<br>
= 1004 * 5/8 = 625 mp5<br>
<br>
Standing mp5 = 0<br>
Super Manas mp5 = 100<br>
Mana Drain = 525 mp5 or 105 mana/sec<br>
<br>
Mana Pool Unbuffed: 6535<br>
<br>
Time to OOM: 62 seconds<br>
<br>
OOM TPS:<br>
Judge every 17.2 seconds.<br>
SoR = 1368 T/8s<br>
JoR = 1321 * 8/17.2 = 614 T/8s<br>
Melee = 392 <br>
= 2374 /8  = 296 TPS<br>
<br>
OOM Mana consumption:<br>
(221 + 123) / 17.2 = 20mana/sec = 100 mp5<br>
<br>
<br>
So from just these numbers you can see that you can burst 1100 TPS for 20 seconds. You can settle down and maintain 770 TPS for another 45 seconds after that.  Once you are OOM you are pushed down to 300 TPS.  This does not count any mana gains from Spiritual Attunement.  This does not count intellect buffs.  This assumes you never get attacked. This also does not consider windfury or any other buffs you might have on you, this also does not count reckoning. This also does not count judgement of wisdom.  This also includes melee parry chance which wont happen if you attack from behind.<br>
<br>
Assume a fight like void reaver.  Now pretend it's worst case scenario where you screw up early or your other tanks have a huge avoidance streak and you NEVER get aggo.  (not going to happen realistically).  Thus you only take pounding damage.<br>
<br>
Over a 5:50 kill, I took 104,000 damage from pounding.  That would be an additional 10,400 mana.  Assuming the pounding is equally distributed that is 10400 / 350 * 5 = 149 mana/5 seconds.<br>
<br>
Plug that into our Time to OOM calculations.<br>
<br>
625 - 100 - 149 = 376 mana/5 = 75.2<br>
<br>
Now assume you have kings (+26 int = 390 mana) unimproved Wild (+14 int = 210 mana) Brilliance (+40 int = 600 mana) = 1200 more mana.<br>
<br>
= 7735 mana. <br>
<br>
Gives you 102 seconds.<br>
<br>
On a fight like Void Reaver, without being targetted once, you can maintain a full threat rotation for 1:42. This would mean using a maximum of one potion.  Your OT threat would range from 770 to 1100 TPS.  As soon as you pull hate these calcs mean nothing because SA will probably fill your mana bar for that period of time and your TPS will go way up because you can include holy shield.<br>
<br>
A druid or a warrior could not maintain a max threat cycle for that long in those circumstances.  They would run through rage far too quickly.<br>
<br>
<br>
Anecdotally: The only times I've had problems off tanking is if I screw up.  If I misplace my consecrate early in the fight and it's not hitting them, or I screw up some other way and end up way down the rung.  I have built secondary threat on Moroes, Void Reaver, Gurtogg, Essence of Desire, pretty much any Backup-Tank fight, except for Gruul, because at the time we were doing him we had 2 prot warriors for karazhan.  <br>
<br>
This was all on learning attempts as well, this is not a matter of me doing after we are on farm status.<br>
<br>
The only time I've ever doubted my ability as an OT was on Moroes, early in karazhan, when I was geared up almost entirely in warrior gear.  Even then the only changes I needed to make were wizard oil, blackened basilisks, and more aggressive potting. <br>
<br>
If you are having real trouble, either you are not being aggressive enough in your threat rotation, and thus not pulling aggro, or else you need more spell damage or intellect.<br>
<br>
Intellect is somewhat important because it cheaply increases your maximum time to OOM.  In terms of item budget, 3 int is roughly 1mp5.  That means that if you're only lasting a minute and a half before you're OOM anyways, the 3 int gives you 45 mana, the 1 mp5 gives you 18 mana.  Considering in a backup-tank situation, your initial burst is the most important because this is what gives you aggro, and once you have it, SA carries you.  But that said I wouldn't go out of my way for it, but it is something you lose for gearing in warrior gear instead of paladin gear.<br>
<br>
The only place this theory may not hold is Gruul.  I have never tried OTing him, though I know paladins who have had successes.  Maybe for that encounter we do struggle.  But there are other encounters where we make up for it.<br>
<br>
In short, my paladin can generate OT threat fine assuming I occasionally get attacked.  Nearly 800 average sustained TPS is fine for an OT for all content that I have done.  (Now 5/5 7/9)</div>

				Intellect is somewhat important because it cheaply increases your maximum time to OOM. In terms of item budget, 3 int is roughly 1mp5. That means that if you're only lasting a minute and a half before you're OOM anyways, the 3 int gives you 45 mana, the 1 mp5 gives you 18 mana. Considering in a backup-tank situation, your initial burst is the most important because this is what gives you aggro, and once you have it, SA carries you. But that said I wouldn't go out of my way for it, but it is something you lose for gearing in warrior gear instead of paladin gear.
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Right, but what's the equivalent in other stats? If you swapped int for spelldamage, you'd go OOM just as fast but your initial burst and your OOM damage would be better; even with another 100 int (or 1500 mana) you'd still go oom (using your numbers) in 15 seconds. 15 seconds of 470 TPS (the difference in burst threat vs OOM threat) is 11550 threat total. What spelldamage would be required to replace that? Depends on the fight length, I suppose.<br>
<br>
Assuming the .5 TPS = 1 SD from the beginning of the thread, you'd get the following<br>
60 seconds: 235 SD<br>
120 seconds: 117<br>
180 seconds: 78 SD<br>
240 seconds: 59 SD<br>
300 seconds: 47 SD<br>
360 seconds: 39 SD<br>
420 seconds: 33 SD<br>
480 seconds: 29 SD<br>
540 seconds : 26 SD<br>
600 seconds: 23 SD<br>
<br>
For shorter fights where no mana is regenerated at all, int is clearly better. For longer fights under the same circumstances, SD is much, much better since spelldamage is cheaper itemization-wise than int is. That's not saying that int isn't good; it'll add some TPS, clearly. And since you can't pick and choose what you get, int might be what you deal with. But for OTing, it looks like it's better to go with higher SD than int if you have a choice.<br>
<br>
Also note that in the first case you'd be much better off with spelldamage since you won't be OOM. It's only in the 120/180/240 second range that it becomes something to consider.</div>

Intellect is paired with spell damage. Dropping spell damage typically drops intellect. <br>
<br>
My point was against wearing warrior gear.  It was not the relative value of spell damage versus intellect. Intellect is not useless.  Spell damage is more important, but most of your tank gear is going to have both on it.  Unless you pick warrior tank gear where you get neither.<br>
<br>
Edit: I also wanted to clarify that I do not think that intellect is better than spell damage.  I would never drop damage for int. But like something like parry rating, while it might not be as good as another stat, it doesn't mean it has no value at all.</div>

</div>True - but my point was that intellect isn't necessary on armor and is for the most part wasted (I originally responded to the notion that paladins 'need' intellect, which I see occasionally here and on the official forums). You can see this in the newer itemization; some of the badge rewards are ignoring it completely, as are a few of the drops in BT that aren't the actual tier sets. <br>
<br>
I guess I'll sum up. When MTing it's important to safely take as much damage as you can in order to maximize mana throughput. Intellect doesn't help with that - effective health does. When OTing it's important to maximize your damage output. Int helps with that, but doesn't help as much as other stats do - and spelldamage is the more important stat here. (and point of fact, if you go OOM you may be better off going with SoB and a big tanking sword instead)</div>

		<div id="post_message_573293">Honestly, if you go totally OOM OTing I think your best bet may be to repeatedly remove and reequip your weapon and shield so that you can get healed.  <br>
<br>
In my case, I'm punting 96 stamina or ~1200ish HP every time I do that.  Getting healed up from that is gonna get you 120 mana and 60 threat from SA; if you time it well with your weapon swings, it costs you minimal threat to do this.<br>
<br>
Now, I'm not claiming that int is totally irrelevant.  Obviously you'd rather have more than less.  But it certainly isn't worth seeking out.<br>
<br>
One place where int *is* especially interesting is in situations such as VR where you will sometimes have aggro and sometimes not have aggro.  When you lose aggro after having it, you'll normally be full mana or close to it, so you're getting multiple cracks at a full mana pool and a boss you don't have aggro on.  So in that situation, having another 1k mana max pool is likely to give you an additional 2k or 3k mana over the course of the fight.</div>

</div>So basically, you're saying that there are two ways to extend your time until OOM as a pally tank:  More intellect OR more spelldamage+downranking.  You think that spelldamage is a more efficient stat.  That's an interesting argument and one bound to stir up some more calculations and theorycraft.<br>
<br>
I still agree with Zeidrich though in that there are not a lot of situations where SIMILAR pally tanking gear puts a pally tank into a position where you're choosing between the two pieces of armor whereas one has more spelldamage and the other has more intellect.  Even if you were in such a situation, you can count on that they are both better for OTing than the warrior equivalent.</div>

</div>Actually, I'm saying that it's better to stack spelldamage when OTing than it is to stack intellect, because it doesn't matter when the threat is dealt - it just matters what your overall threat is. Downranking doesn't factor into that at all. Extending your time until OOM isn't important since you could just put out more threat early. Heck, one could argue that the best way to maximize your threat is to maximize your damage when AW is up, and that happens when you maximize spelldamage.<br>
<br>
To my knowledge no one's done all that much actual testing on the coefficients of downranking damaging spells; if they have (especially for seals) I'd love to see it. <br>
<br>
As to comparing pally gear with/without, here's a good one: <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33522"><span><span class="purplename">[Chestguard of the Stoic Guardian]</span></span></a> vs <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29066"><span><span class="purplename">[Justicar Chestguard]</span></span></a> vs <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30123"><span><span class="purplename">[Crystalforge Chestguard]</span></span></a>. The stoic guardian has the most damage/healing, better stamina and better avoidance; what it doesn't have is int. Is 30 int worth 8 SD? For longer fights, yep. That doesn't mean you should get rid of the set bonus for T4, but it might be worth it for T5, especially given how good the chestpiece is in general (and how bad the 2-piece set bonus is for T5)<br>
<br>
Anyway - long story short, paladins don't need intellect.</div>

	</tbody></table>
</div>To the first part, and I can't stress <b>this</b> enough - If you're dead, it doesn't matter how well you held the mob.  We're tanks.  Our job is to stand there (sometimes move around slowly) and take a beating.  We're not there for our damage.  So any threat you're doing past what your top dps is putting out is completely wasted.  Having 400 spell damage and real tanking stats is <b>far</b> better than having 600 spell damage and weak tanking stats, unless your healers are mindlessly bored.  As a tank, I always assume that while I'm going to get healed, it's going to be my responsibility to help keep myself alive as much as possible.  Maxing out your threat beyond that of what your dps can do doesn't help, well anything.<br>
<br>
As for the second part, that's entirely not true.  Read through the Pally Maintanking thread in these class forums, and you'll find plenty of examples of paladins that gear exclusively in warrior gear, and compensate with a high spell-damage weapon, flasks and food buffs. Take a weapon like <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33283"><span><span class="purplename">[Amani Punisher]</span></span></a>, enchant it with major spell power, and use <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=22861"><span><span class="whitename">[Flask of Blinding Light]</span></span></a>, <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=27657"><span><span class="whitename">[Blackened Basilisk]</span></span></a> and <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=22522"><span><span class="whitename">[Superior Wizard Oil]</span></span></a> and you're rocking over 400 spell damage without wearing any pally piece of armor.  Given that <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=22851"><span><span class="whitename">[Flask of Fortification]</span></span></a> buffs hp and not stamina, you only need to wear about 42 more stamina on your gear to compensate.  Assuming from gem choices that 9 spell damage has the same itemization points as 12 stamina, you're getting over twice as much utility out of that flask - while at the same time probably increasing your tanking stats and ignoring weaker stats like intellect from the resulting armor choices.  (I don't generally practice what I preach though, as my guild sells me Marks of the Illidari on the cheap, and my stamina/avoidance set isn't quite as nice as my spell damage set).<br>

</div>But you're not at all.  Wearing mail and healing gear means you're not substantially better than a holy pally with a few points in prot.  The only time I ever run out of mana on Al'ar's adds (and I'm very much the defacto add tank at this point), is in the early stages when I resist a explosion or two.  With me tanking the adds, we can start holding them when he's around 50% in phase 1, which means we have 4-6 adds with ~20% health ready to be insta-gibbed when P2 starts.  Trust me, starting phase 2 with Al'ar at 85% health makes the fight go way easier.  And once you start holding adds in P1, you'll basically never run out of mana.  Burn Al'ar down to around 30-35%, and then let your dps go nuts on him while you just easily kite the adds that show up around.  Multi-mob control - that's our strength - use it (also, use your shield or taunt to pick up the adds, it's much simpler than healing).<br>
<br>
Don't take this as me attacking you, I just don't understand how you're better in this role than a dps warrior or a ret pally with a shield strapped on?   Or even a holy pally with a bit of tanking gear?<br>

		<div id="post_message_573582">Hi all<br>
<br>
Being new to posting yet having been a reader of this particular thread for awhile I'll throw in my two pence worth.<br>
<br>
I've found that Intellect is essential wherever you can afford it, I've forsaken +150 hp on chest in favour of +6 all stats purely for that extra bit of intellect.  I've also put five points in Divine Intellect as opposed to one handed specialisation.<br>
<br>
Having tanked in 25 man raids I have a bad habit of running out of mana on trash.  Obviously on bosses that is not an issue and although I can easily change gear at the click of a button (thanks Outfitter) I still prefer to have a somewhat 'rounded' set that I can take into 25 man raids and not have to change from one pull to the next.<br>
<br>
I'm also an enchanter and have given up the 24 spell damage on rings for the +4 all stats enchant on rings, as it not only gives 8 stamina but 8 intellect and 8 spirit (not to mention 8 agility).  The spirit in a raid gives me a tiny amount of spell damage back via kindly priests putting points into making it improved.<br>
<br>
So although I have improved my gear considerably in the few months that I have been tanking I highly value intellect and attempt to balance my stats out wherever I can.  <br>
<br>
I have on more than one ocassion gotten into a debate with fellow raiders about wanting Blessing of Wisdom over Blessing of Light.<br>
<br>
Ultimately My spec and my preferences to it will always change depending on my gear and a Paladin tank with no mana is useless.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Well the simple answer is "I am using the strengths of the protection pally to my advantage" which is precisely why I'm wearing that gear for the Al'ar fight. <br>
<br>
I'm tanking the adds. I draw the adds by Healing aggro. Once they get to me I build up threat and folks DPS them down. The faster I get my threat up the quicker they can attack. I was wearing protect full gear the first couple times and I was running out of mana quickly. I wasn't gaining it back fast enough from heals because I was barely being hurt except on explosions, which only take about 7k damage. As long as I'm not in flame patches and we don't kill 2 Adds at the same time I'm good to go. THusly the gear I had on worked very well for me on Al'ar Adds.<br>
<br>
If you look at my gear I have on currently. It's more normal gear for tanking</div>

	</tbody></table>
</div>Odd way to get initial aggro on a single mob, but if it works for you, then that's fine.<br>
<br>
We did Al'ar again last night so it's fresh in my mind again (especially as I won his cloak )<br>
I don't tank the adds in my boss-tanking gear either.<br>
What I do use is my 5-man aggro tanking set.<br>
I take off my pure avoidance gear (Maiden's gauntlets, badge leggings, Nightbane's chest etc) and use T4 replacements for it.<br>
My spelldamage goes over 500, my mana pool hits about 8k buffed and I drop around 3k hp - but I maintain high armour and over 490 defence.<br>
We still stack adds at the end of phase 1, and can quite happily sit there with 3 or 4 on me while waiting for phase 2 to start.<br>
<br>
Our method for me getting aggro is for one of the hunters to aggro the add when it spawns, and as it arrives at the base of the ramp, I simply taunt it and JoR. The hunter has to put 3 or 4 shots on it then go back to Al'ar, so it doesn't interupt his dps much, but it saves a heck of alot of my mana instead of trying to get it by healing aggro. After a quill I follow the tank to the upper platform and wait there for a new add, picking it up with consecration, or avenger's shield if I was a bit late arriving.<br>
In phase 2 I have a macro that will target one of the adds spawning from the meteor, raid mark it, and cast avenger's sheild at it, allowing me to quickly get aggro and back up to one of the walls, while range dps take down the adds one at a time - marked one first. I tank both adds together in phase 2, freeing up the other tanks for taunt rotations on Al'ar himself, or bear tanks to go dps.<br>
<br>
If the ranged dps get trigger happy in phase 2 or I resist a couple of explosions in a row, then I may start to run into mana problems and need to pot. Mana for phase one has never been a problem though.</div>

But you're not at all.  Wearing mail and healing gear means you're not substantially better than a holy pally with a few points in prot.  The only time I ever run out of mana on Al'ar's adds (and I'm very much the defacto add tank at this point), is in the early stages when I resist a explosion or two.  With me tanking the adds, we can start holding them when he's around 50% in phase 1, which means we have 4-6 adds with ~20% health ready to be insta-gibbed when P2 starts.  Trust me, starting phase 2 with Al'ar at 85% health makes the fight go way easier.  And once you start holding adds in P1, you'll basically never run out of mana.  Burn Al'ar down to around 30-35%, and then let your dps go nuts on him while you just easily kite the adds that show up around.  Multi-mob control - that's our strength - use it (also, use your shield or taunt to pick up the adds, it's much simpler than healing).</div>

	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>I have no idea what gear you saw when you checked my armory, however I can assure you I wasn't wearing healing gear. I did replace Warrior gear pieces with Spell damage pieces. and I was holding on to multiple Al'ar adds at a time. This was our first kill on Al'ar and I do want to tank more adds to bring into phase 2. I can tell you that with the gear I had on I could have easily taken on 4-5 adds at once without any trouble. And the adds I did take into phase 2 were at 15-20% HP. The reasons I wore the spell gear are<br>
A: I was drawing aggro by healing, the more healing the more threat. It actually works VERY well, I suggest you try it<br>
B: The faster I get threat the faster DPS can burn down<br>
   - Right now when an add spawns, the Warlock is at 50% HP. I heal him back and by the time the Add(s) get to me I will consecrate once and judge righteousness on the first one to be killed. DPS can immediately start after I judge. BTW the adds go right for me and rarely ever hit anyone else first. I don't have to worry about misses and hardly ever need to use avenger shield (unless i just want to help out DPS).<br>
C: The only time I take substantial damage is when the Add blows up, all the Def/avoidance in the world isn't going to help that only FR will.<br>
<br>

<br>
I'm not offended at your comment, I like constructive criticism. I'm trying to be the best pally tank anyone's seen.<br>
<br>
<u><i><b>Added stats from Al'ar fight below</b></i></u><br>
Here is the average Normal damage I took from al'ar adds in that gear is "959"<br>
The average Fire Damage (when the blow up) is "6032"<br>
Even with 5 adds pounding me I still have more than enough HP to stay alive<br>
and that is with mostly DPS gear substituted for pure Warrior gear.<br>
* it's worth noting that I hardly used Holy Shield at all during the fight</div>

		<div id="post_message_573858">Speaking of mana efficiency and maximizing threat, is there any consideration to using a SoV/SoR rotation while offtanking? (Obviously, Alliance-only option here.) IE, SoV... Judge, SoR... Judge, rinse, repeat.

<br>
SoR obviously scales much better with spell damage, but SoV has a really nice judgment and a very high base DoT. It seems like if you could get a 100% SoV DoT + 50% SoR damage you would be giving yourself quite a threat boost. Or is it simply too risky to get a refresh on the SoV DoT in the 7 seconds you have left after going through 8 second of SoR, between resists, dodges/parries, and the proc chance?<br>
<br>
My paladin just got SoV now, and he obviously hasn't had a chance to tank any raid bosses with it, being level 64. I will see if I can pull this rotation on some 5-man bosses, though, and see how it works out.</div>

		<div id="post_message_573890">SoV/SoR rotation works to an extent but it's next to impossible to keep up if any sort of movement is involved.<br>
With my S2 mace speed I can just about start with SoV, build a 5 stack, judge it and SoR for 10s, JoR and SoV again without losing the stack of SoV, but it's not reliable and SoV will drop off more often than not. It's probably more doable with the 8s improved judgement.<br>
<br>
Doing anything more than that to try and maintain higher threat would mean resealing SoV before you are able to JoR in order to maintain the SoV full stack, and would entail more mana usage. This makes the problem worse as paladin OTing is about trying to maximise threat with limited mana - if we are taking enough damage to have unlimited mana then OTing is not really an issue (constant consecration, judge on every cooldown, avenger's shield on every cooldown etc).</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Actually, I'm saying that it's better to stack spelldamage when OTing than it is to stack intellect, because it doesn't matter when the threat is dealt - it just matters what your overall threat is. Downranking doesn't factor into that at all. Extending your time until OOM isn't important since you could just put out more threat early. Heck, one could argue that the best way to maximize your threat is to maximize your damage when AW is up, and that happens when you maximize spelldamage.<br>
<br>
To my knowledge no one's done all that much actual testing on the coefficients of downranking damaging spells; if they have (especially for seals) I'd love to see it. <br>
<br>
As to comparing pally gear with/without, here's a good one: <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33522"><span><span class="purplename">[Chestguard of the Stoic Guardian]</span></span></a> vs <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29066"><span><span class="purplename">[Justicar Chestguard]</span></span></a> vs <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30123"><span><span class="purplename">[Crystalforge Chestguard]</span></span></a>. The stoic guardian has the most damage/healing, better stamina and better avoidance; what it doesn't have is int. Is 30 int worth 8 SD? For longer fights, yep. That doesn't mean you should get rid of the set bonus for T4, but it might be worth it for T5, especially given how good the chestpiece is in general (and how bad the 2-piece set bonus is for T5)<br>
<br>
Anyway - long story short, paladins don't need intellect.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Either of the three would be a good choice.  What you use it for depends on what stats you need, set bonuses etc.  My point is that it's a lot better than the chest that drops from Zul'jin, for example.</div>

</div><br>
I personally find that it's too risky.  SoV just falls off of boss mobs way too fast.  Whether or not it refreshes the stack is luck based and there's not much that we can do about it other than inefficiently spacking spell hit if you are using a 1.6 or 1.8 speed weapon.  I sometimes have a 5-stack fall off even when it's the only seal I'm using.  However, it is well known that using a slower weapon greatly helps SoV uptime.  One thing that you could do is build the 5-stack using your spelldamage weapon then after the 5-stack is up, you can switch to the Lower City Exalted mace.  This 2.4 speed weapon is supposedly extremely good at keeping SoV up.<br>
<br>
Either way, if you're alliance you have a huge OT advantage over horde paladins because of SoV.  I would go crazy if I were horde and this is something that I think they really need to give to BE pallies.  The advantage comes from the fact that you can pop trinkets, get PI, get spelldamage procs etc. then proceed to build up a stack with what would effectively be more than 1,000 spelldamage.</div>

				I gotta say, I sorta hate when people say this as a tank. In fact, I think it's the exact opposite, and minimizing damage intake while safely minimizing mana throughput is far and away the most important thing. If people wanted someone to solely come in and hold aggro, they'd find their nearest friendly lock.

</div>I don't think it's reasonable to minimize damage too much; if you minimize damage too much, you minimize your threat too much and can't down anything in a reasonable amount of time. That's why I said 'safely' maximize damage taken. Safe isn't taxing your healers too much. Safe isn't being able to be killed in a flurry or a series of lucky blows.<br>
<br>
Really, you should take enough damage to maintain your threat cycle. You don't want to take much more than that, and you don't want to take much less. Sorry if I wasn't clearer with that statement. <br>
<br>
As to keeping SoV up with slower vs. faster weapons, someone did some theorycrafting on this at maintankadin, and it turns out that the difference is fairly minor. Slower weapons win out, but it's only like a 2% difference. Some others have given some really astonishing numbers on SoV/SoR rotation TPS success though, where it's upped their TPS by a few hundred given the same spelldamage.<br>

				For very specific fights, yes. But for the vast majority at T5+, SA easily exceeds mana expenditure such that 30 int isn't even worth 1 SD, it's just plain worthless. That's the problem with it. It would be just fine if it gave a secondary benefit such as, oh, about 1% dodge per 25 Intellect.

</div>I agree. Sorry; I should've said 'is 8 SD worth 30 Int?' When you're maintanking I don't think it's an issue ever; no amount of int is worth any SD. For offtanking it becomes a more reasonable question, but even then I believe it comes out in favor pretty much any time the fight lasts longer than a few minutes.</div>

</div>In our alt-group TK run, which my paladin helps tank for, this is exactly what I do as well.  The holy pally in question can even holy shock the bird in question if it decided to go after someone else, and drag it over.<br>
<br>
I'm working on adjusting my set for that particular fight.  Something like <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29172"><span><span class="purplename">[Ashyen's Gift]</span></span></a> is much better than a 2nd tank ring, for example.

				<div style="font-style:italic">As to keeping SoV up with slower vs. faster weapons, someone did some theorycrafting on this at maintankadin, and it turns out that the difference is fairly minor. Slower weapons win out, but it's only like a 2% difference. Some others have given some really astonishing numbers on SoV/SoR rotation TPS success though, where it's upped their TPS by a few hundred given the same spelldamage.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>That is correct that the difference is minor, given that faster weapons get more chances to refresh the stack despite the lower proc rate.  And while you can theoretically bounce between SoV and SoR for crazy threat gains, it's almost never worthwhile because your chance to lose the SoV stack skyrockets.  I used to try things like this and had very poor returns on it, so I switched to just using SoV/JoV for sustained threat.  But even then I was losing the stack from time to time, even on fights like Prince where you're basically standing in one place the entire fight (barring crappy infernal placement).  A quick look at some math shows why...<br>
<br>
Assume a 2.0s weapon with 3/3 Precision and 5/5 Combat Expertise and no +hit gear for sake of analysis, attacking a level 73 target.  I'll be using "best guess" numbers for dodge/parry since countless WWS parses haven't determined exact numbers yet.<br>
<br>
* Chance to miss boss on any given swing = 9.00% - 3.00% from Precision = 6.00%<br>
* Chance for boss to dodge any given swing = 5.60% - 1.25% from Expertise = 4.35%<br>
* Chance for boss to parry any given swing = 11.20% - 1.25% from Expertise = 9.95%<br>
* Chance to proc SoV on weapon hit = 2.0s / 3.0s = 66.67%<br>
* Chance for said proc to not be resisted = 83.00% + 3.00% from Precision = 86.00%<br>
<br>
In order for SoV to even have a chance at proccing, you need to hit or crit your target.  Given these numbers, the chance of this happening is 100.00% - 6.00% (miss) - 4.35% (dodge) - 9.95% (parry) = 79.70%.  If you actually land, the chance of the SoV stack incrementing/refreshing is 66.67% * 86.00% = 57.33%.  So, every 2.0 seconds, the chance of SoV landing is your chance to hit/crit (79.70%) times the effective proc rate after resists (57.33%), or 45.69%.  With a 2.0s weapon, you will average 7.5 attacks in the 15 second window you have to reapply SoV.  So, at any point in the fight, the chance of a given swing starting a string of failed procs is (1-45.69%)^7.5, or 1.03%.  In layman's terms, the odds of losing the stack at least once in a 5 minute fight consisting of 150 swings is about 2 in 3.<br>
<br>
With only a 7 second window to refresh SoV after a SoR/JoR sequence, the chance to start a string of failed procs jumps to (1-45.69%)^3.5, or 11.81%.  In a 5 minute fight you're virtually guaranteed to lose the stack multiple times in the fight, causing your overall threat generation to actually go down rather than up.<br>
<br>
Now, this is a pure theorycraft scenario that ignores other factors that will make the odds much worse for you.  Things like boss repositioning, stuns, fears, silences, etc. will all drastically reduce your chances of keeping the stack active.  Long term, if you want to use SoV for sustained TPS, you'll need a fair amount of melee hit and spell hit gear to avoid plateaus that typically result in a DPSer pulling aggro and probably wiping the raid.<br>
<br>
Given that it's already this risky just to keep SoV active, there's no way I can recommend trying to bounce between SoV and SoR for long-term threat generation.</div>

The stoic guardian has the most damage/healing, better stamina and better avoidance; what it doesn't have is int. Is 30 int worth 8 SD? For longer fights, yep. That doesn't mean you should get rid of the set bonus for T4, but it might be worth it for T5, especially given how good the chestpiece is in general (and how bad the 2-piece set bonus is for T5)<br>
<br>
Anyway - long story short, paladins don't need intellect.</div>

	</tbody></table>
</div>What bothers me is you don't explain yourself.  You say "Look, this has less int, but more stamina and spell damage, and since intellect is useless, I therefor conclude that intellect is useless"<br>
<br>
Each of those items were designed for different purposes.  T5 was designed with Hyjal tanking in mind.  Thus it is stacked with block value, block rating, and very little avoidance. <br>
<br>
The heroic chest was designed with 10 man main tanking in mind.  Thus it was loaded up with avoidance, spell damage, and not intellect, because you're going to be constantly taking damage in a MT role.<br>
<br>
Int has a role to play.  Because you don't see it in your day-to-day play doesn't mean it doesn't exist. There is limited situations where I use it to it's full extent, but I do need it from time to time. <br>
<br>
Those times are:<br>
Trash healing in tank gear in case mobs get loose.<br>
Offtanking or building secondary threat on certain trash or target swapping bosses.<br>
Offhealing on fights where I'm in tank gear, such as Kael Thas during gravity lapse.  Mother Sharaz as a Saber Lash tank. Maybe supremus when I'm hateful tank.<br>
<br>
Note that being a MT on any fight, or directly tanking a mob does not show up on that list.</div>

		<div id="post_message_574439">This topic has gone around a bit -- honestly it would behoove everyone to keep in mind that you should *always* have different tanking suits for different situations.  If I'm heroic tanking, INT does have some value, because it lets me go a few more pulls without having to stop to drink, because I like to chain pull.  On the other hand, INT has basically 0 value if you are the MT, because you should be overflowing with mana from SA.  For a hard hitting boss like Lynx in ZA, I want a pure tanking set, high in HP, good avoidance.  I don't really care about spell damage quite as much, threat is secondary there to some degree.  However, for Void Reaver, I don't need that kind of tank set.  I can swap in some pieces with spell damage, and in fact I want to gear my set toward threat (and any secondary concern would be avoidance over HP, to try to avoid the knockaway) since I'm going to get plenty of heals and VR isn't exactly a place where you should gib.<br>
<br>
Notice how all of those I gave different reasons?  There is no tanking set that covers all possible situations.  You mix and match depending on the particular fight and your role in it.</div>

</div>Did I? <br>
<br>
Look at that chart again. For 100 int, you only need the equivalent of about 25-30 SD depending on how long the fight lasts for SD to be as good as int in overall threat generation for an offtank. That's using your numbers. Based on that, the chest of the stoic guardian is better than T4 or T5 for offtanking - at least by itself. If you factor in the T4 bonus that's better for offtanking, but the stoic guardian is better overall. The stoic guardian provides more pure avoidance, more stamina, and more spelldamage; it is better in general cases for MTing and it allows you to put out more threat in OT situations. Where it is not as good is in tanking adds, but that's mostly because of block value/rating; it has nothing to do with the int. <br>
<br>
I also understood that the stoic guardian was actually designed for tanking in Hyjal/BT and was the bridge between T5 and T6 as you need more avoidance going forward. T5 is certainly good for tanking the waves of undead, but it's not particularly good for any of the boss encounters. Of course if you're not actually tanking those, it doesn't matter.<br>
<br>
My point about the comparison in items is that pound for pound intellect is not nearly as useful a stat as spelldamage is, even in specific situations like you described. Is it completely useless? No; in some small cases it can be convenient or even decent. Then again, so is strength, but no one would ever say that strength was a stat that tankadins need.</div>

		<div id="post_message_574601">I guess I'm alone in honestly having mana issues fairly often.  I could make it easier on myself by using a lower threat rotation, but to be honest the idea of lower threat rotation makes my skin crawl- I'll take the hit and chain pot as fights require it.  I also don't MT all that much so that's doubtless part of it, but it's fairly rare that I ever feel I have 'enough' aggro, and there's almost always something I can do to dump into more threat (you'd be shocked how often you can sneak in AS tosses).  I have my threat suit (which is my VR suit really) and use that off and on on trash (once I know it), but mostly I just lump it and chug mana pots like they're going out of style.  If it's an aoe pull I can usually sneak on a JoW, which helps.<br>
<br>
I'd also like to...well, 5th or so, the comment about AS being used on the birds on Alar.  I have my Conc aura up for phase 1, and that usually lets me get a shield off fairly reliably (we tank all the adds through till phase 2).  I also wear a ranged hitcapped set and have not (yet) seen any misses or taunt resists- obviously that's a pretty big deal, and suprisingly easy to get (badge gloves, def/hit ring from H Tombs, neck from SV, trinket from Romeo/H BF, it's easier than it sounds).  I wear a variation on the suit for Vashj and I've got to say the assurance that my stuff will hit is worth tons in peace of mind.  Failing that, makr up the bird as it's coming down the stairs and have your melee watching, ready with a stun so you can pick it back up.</div>

		<div id="post_message_574735">This comes back as a topic on every single class with mana. The time you can last until oom is almost a meaningless number for comparing to see what is actually better. Since after you're oom your mana regen is far from 0, the guy who lasted 10% longer than you actually did FAR LESS than 10% more threat than you. If a big enough portion of the mana comes from regen, and the guy that lasted longer did so purely because of his bigger starting mana pool, the difference in actual threat generated over the fight will be very small. If you do the theorycraft for "paladin A did 10k threat during the fight with the mana he had, while paladin B did 12k threat" you'll get a lot more useful numbers than if you say "paladin A lasted 10% longer than paladin B". Lasting longer hardly means anything, since you also need to calculate how much threat the short-lasting paladin was generating while oom, might as well just figure out how much each was able to do with his mana and not even bother claculating the meaningless value of "who lasted longer". <br>
<br>
Calculating how much threat each could generate will give you far more useful numbers for comparing what's actually better.<br>
<br>
On a side note, on 5-mans unless you're consistently going oom in the midst of the pull, int is the most useless stat ever. While higher mana pool allows more pulls without drinking, you also drink longer. If you add up the total time drinking you will spend less time drinking with more spell dmg than with more int, however you may obviously spend more actual drinks. Doing more threat/mana reduces time spent drinking back that mana. Having a bigger pool just means it takes both longer to drain it and longer to refill it, totalling in zero down<b>time</b> reduction. Many forget that the number of drinks you spend has little to do with your actual downtime.</div>

</div>I respectfully disagree, because I'd rather stop the group less to drink.  When we do have to stop, then nobody cares if it takes 30 seconds to get to full, and other classes probably need to drink some by then.  But if I have to stop every 3 pulls, it will vaugely annoy people.  Having 1-2k extra mana means I might go several more pulls, since it's not "Oh that's just a few extra consecrates" -- it's an extra buffer of mana that is slowly drained depending on how much I cast and how much SA returns.   To give a better example -- I'd rather do all the groups up to Nethekurse in Heroic SH in a row without having to stop to drink until we get to the door, rather than stop twice for drinking.   Swapping in gear like <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=24126"><span><span class="bluename">[Figurine - Living Ruby Serpent]</span></span></a>, <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29254"><span><span class="purplename">[Boots of the Righteous Path]</span></span></a> and so on.<br>
<br>
Additionally, if anyone has to drink it's the DPS casters for a few ticks, and meanwhile I've already started on the next pull with the healer/melee.  This does two things -- the pull is already locked down, and I've gotten a fair bit of mana back either via JoW or SA, since I'll actually have some time to take damage.  My healer is the least taxed out of everyone.  A slightly bigger mana pool helps me here, because there's more to fill and I won't start a next pull if I'm below 1.5k mana.<br>
<br>
This is just my experience from the heroics I like to run.  Psychologically it just feels better for most people if you only have to stop a few times to drink, rather than repeatedly, even if it's shorter drinks.  With approrpiate spell selection, I might have to stop once from Blood Guard Porung to Warbringer Om'rogg, stop before engaging him, stop after engaging him, and then stop before Kargath.  On a side note, I view my healers mana bar as a mana potion for myself.  If I'm finding myself mana starved, I'll make sure I position myself that I have my back to a few mobs in a pull once everything has been locked down, allowing myself to get hit a few more times to get mana back.  Typically my healer is never really that stressed to begin with.</div>

</div>I agree here, to a point.  I've never found it a problem to drink for a few ticks while marking the next pull (Although with AoE threat it doesn't matter much, I do mark at least 2 targets in any pull 3+).  Assuming you have mage biscuits, you end up with 1k regen in the 5 sec it take to mark and pull.  <br>
<br>
But, I've never really had anyone complain about my drinking.  They are usually happy that aggro is generally locked down.<br>
<br>
<br>
Although last night I did have a warrior in a rush to Attumen (we were trying to beat our record time), and a hunter that MD pulled the rest of the ballroom to me while I was looting Moroes (he thought I was taking too long).  Fun times.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Assume a 2.0s weapon with 3/3 Precision and 5/5 Combat Expertise and no +hit gear for sake of analysis, attacking a level 73 target.  I'll be using "best guess" numbers for dodge/parry since countless WWS parses haven't determined exact numbers yet.<br>
<br>
* Chance to miss boss on any given swing = 9.00% - 3.00% from Precision = 6.00%<br>
* Chance for boss to dodge any given swing = 5.60% - 1.25% from Expertise = 4.35%<br>
* Chance for boss to parry any given swing = 11.20% - 1.25% from Expertise = 9.95%<br>
* Chance to proc SoV on weapon hit = 2.0s / 3.0s = 66.67%<br>
* Chance for said proc to not be resisted = 83.00% + 3.00% from Precision = 86.00%<br>
<br>
In order for SoV to even have a chance at proccing, you need to hit or crit your target.  Given these numbers, the chance of this happening is 100.00% - 6.00% (miss) - 4.35% (dodge) - 9.95% (parry) = 79.70%.  If you actually land, the chance of the SoV stack incrementing/refreshing is 66.67% * 86.00% = 57.33%.  So, every 2.0 seconds, the chance of SoV landing is your chance to hit/crit (79.70%) times the effective proc rate after resists (57.33%), or 45.69%.  With a 2.0s weapon, you will average 7.5 attacks in the 15 second window you have to reapply SoV.  So, at any point in the fight, the chance of a given swing starting a string of failed procs is (1-45.69%)^7.5, or 1.03%.  In layman's terms, the odds of losing the stack at least once in a 5 minute fight consisting of 150 swings is about 2 in 3.<br>
<br>
With only a 7 second window to refresh SoV after a SoR/JoR sequence, the chance to start a string of failed procs jumps to (1-45.69%)^3.5, or 11.81%.  In a 5 minute fight you're virtually guaranteed to lose the stack multiple times in the fight, causing your overall threat generation to actually go down rather than up.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Could SoV/SoR juggling be a viable offtanking strategy on certain mobs (stationary, no silence, etc)?<br>
<br>
Using those numbers, if you're standing behind the boss and only have to worry about misses taking away from your hits then your chance to have a stack drop off will be significantly decreased.  Hitting 94% of the time, the chance of SoV being applied per swing goes up to 53.89%.  Carrying that through, the chance of a given swing starting a string of failed procs in general is 0.30% (down from 1.03%) and the chance given you're trying to keep SoR up half the time falls to 6.66% (from 11.81%).  And that's only going to get better as you include other +hit gear you may have gotten for other abilities.<br>
<br>
I haven't worked the numbers yet, but I'd guess you need to look at how much of a hit your threat gen takes while you're building your 5-stack back up again (since it is likely going to fall off at least once), and whether the extra threat throughout makes up for it.  Also will need to take into account that if your 5-stack is falling off, if you used tricks to stack your spell damage to inflate it, you may have less threat after it falls off if things are on cooldown.  Is it worth the extra threat from working SoR into the mix, or would you be better off just sticking to one or the other?  Any anecdotal experience?<br>
<br>
I have to admit, a part of me cringes a bit at the unreliable aspect of it.  Being solid and predictable seems huge, especially as a tank since so often dps gets a "feel" for how hard they can go on a given fight.</div>

</div>I guess this depends on how you run stuff then, because I almost never mark anything -- outside of a skull for first target.  CC is mostly taboo in any instance I run.  No, seriously, I have to tell people "please don't CC, CC is for wimps."  For SH I don't even mark anything since I assume the groups I run with know to kill the Legionnaire first, and even if they don't so what. :P</div>

</div>Not at all, Bosses that like to look constantly at other classes to cast something or channel, I will run out of mana on if i refuse to pot. Rage is an example, not only does my threat get hurt becuase he doesn't really like to eat Holy shield up, but unless I diliberately take a few ticks of death and decay my output simply outstrips my intake in terms of mana. This is the same when tanking adds on Azgalor (especially if I'm killed by the summoning and have to go at it again starting at 50% mana with minimal buffs). I've all but run dry on Teron and Najentus also after extended avoidance streaks, but this is the same with warriors too, although I don't have to sacrifice my un-crushability for 'rage' to gen threat as Holy shield in and of itself is a beutiful thing.</div>

				\T5 is better than Stoic Guardian for MTing as well. It loses roughly 60hp when bonuses are considered, but that's more than made up for by the extra armor and the block value applied to just one incoming attack (~66 with Shield Spec). The only advantage of Stoic Guardian is the extra dodge, but that's not a big deal if you're already crush-immune.

</div>Let's just say that the value of dodge is a bit argued about then. It certainly isn't 'not a big deal' against higher-end content. <br>
<br>
I do agree - T5 is probably slightly better than Stoic Guardian for OTing. Slightly. T4 loses in both cases though unless you need it for the set bonus. Add that T5 has a higher ilvl, and it makes you really want that int spent elsewhere. <br>
<br>
And are we really talking about how good heroic badge rewards and T5 are for doing 5-mans? Yeah, int is more convenient for doing that content repeatedly; it makes the runs go more smoothly. But I don't think that gearing for 5-mans should be the reason to itemize the raid tier gear in a certain way, nor is it a good justification for spending ilvl points on int. If you're wearing T4/T5 gear to do heroics, chances are you've maximized other things anyway and aren't wanting as much defense, avoidance, or even stamina in favor of spelldamage, block rating and block value. Would you really want that to be the itemization pattern? Int can be useful in that situation, but I'd rather go grab a couple trinkets or random rings than want it on the raid gear.<br>
<br>
I also drink as I mark and set up the next pull; seems like a good time to do it in general. And marking is somewhat essential as I tend to have to run pugs.</div>

</div>It isn't a big deal.  What matters more than anything in high-end MTing is being able to survive the worst-case scenario, and T5 is better than Stoic Guardian for that.  The dodge may slightly reduce your chance of encountering that worst-case scenario, but it'll still happen, and when it does Crystalforge gives you a better chance to survive than Stoic Guardian.<br>

</div>I did explain myself, but I'll do it again. 8 SD is better than 30 int because you do more overall threat for longer fights (and if they're that short it likely doesn't matter), it's better in the MT case, and it does more burst damage combined with AW. I didn't put that directly into the calculations shown but I mentioned it; basically, each spelldamage point is worth .65 TPS for the first 20 seconds, then .5 TPS afterwards. That wasn't what was used in the base calculations, (.5 was it) but you can see that it will improve at a higher rate. Not hugely, true, but it does mean the chart looks like this:<br>
<br>
seconds  SD required to be equivalent to 100 int<br>
60	213.6363636<br>
120	111.9047619<br>
180	75.80645161<br>
240	57.31707317<br>
300	46.07843137<br>
360	38.52459016<br>
420	33.09859155<br>
480	29.01234568<br>
540	25.82417582<br>
600	23.26732673<br>

A fight needs to be 7-8 minutes long for stoic guardian to outperform T4. Alternately, if the fight is less than 100 seconds, Stoic will always outperform T4.<br>

</div>I still don't see that as entirely true, especially since the stoic guardian gives you more HP. Is more HP worth more than block value? Is it worth more when you factor in dodge as well? There are quite a few high-end tanks liking the avoidance as well. Too much avoidance is a bad thing, but you can't go with 40% avoidance into Hyjal/BT content and expect to do well as MT. I know of very few paladin MTs that go in with a very high block value set into T6 content. <br>

</div>No, it's slightly better. T4 is slightly worse than the stoic guardian, which is slightly worse than T5. We are not talking about a significant difference here; 450 mana allows an extra 3 seconds of the threat cycle listed above at 800 TPS, or 2400 threat. 3 SD allows an extra 1.5-1.6 TPS for the lifetime of the fight, or about 800-900 total threat depending on the length of the fight (in that example I used an 8 minute fight) 1500 threat over the life of a battle is not a lot; you'd gain more threat by unequipping and re-equipping your sword and shield and getting SA. For an 8 minute fight we're talking a difference of 3 TPS. We are at best talking marginal differences. If you want bigger differences, you have to maximize your mana-starved damage. To do that, I would imagine you'd have to equip a warrior tanking weapon, use seal of blood if it's available, and rely more heavily on melee damage. Or as I said above, downrank more aggressively, but I've still not seen a source on the downranking coefficients on SoR/JoR.<br>
<br>
Finally, I'm sorry for the derail on this; this is way too trivial of a point to be making about something in this thread, and is not particularly useful for protection builds to know one way or another. I apologize and will refrain from making further comments on this subject in the future.</div>

</div>It's not the length of the fight that matters, it's how long you're offtanking.  When you lose threat on Voidreaver, it's almost always more than 100 seconds but less than 7 minutes before you pick it up again (and thus get a free mana refill.)<br>

</div>Stoic Guardian is roughly 60 extra hp factoring in bonuses.  Crystalforge is 66 extra block value with Shield Spec.  Ergo, even if you're getting one-shot, Crystalforge lets you survive a larger burst.  Much more likely if you're getting bursted to death is that you're getting 3 or 4-shot, in which case Crystalforge is worth effectively another 140-200 hp.  The <i>only</i> exception is when you're taking exclusively magic damage.<br>

</div>Block value contributes to burst survivability.  Dodge contributes to healer mana endurance.  The first is the bigger concern on 80%+ of raid encounters.  Improved Holy Shield will never run out of charges in a single-tanking situation, so the chief reason for a prot warrior to stack avoidance -- conservation of block charges -- doesn't apply to us.<br>
<br>
And even the healer-endurance argument isn't terribly strong.  A tank that stacks avoidance may take less damage overall, but it'll be more spiky and result in a lot more overheals and generally more aggressive casting by the healers.  A tank that stacks block value will take smoother and more predictable damage, resulting in less mana wasted on overhealing.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I still don't see that as entirely true, especially since the stoic guardian gives you more HP. Is more HP worth more than block value? Is it worth more when you factor in dodge as well? There are quite a few high-end tanks liking the avoidance as well.

No, it's slightly better. T4 is slightly worse than the stoic guardian, which is slightly worse than T5. We are not talking about a significant difference here; 450 mana allows an extra 3 seconds of the threat cycle listed above at 800 TPS, or 2400 threat. 3 SD allows an extra 1.5-1.6 TPS for the lifetime of the fight, or about 800-900 total threat depending on the length of the fight (in that example I used an 8 minute fight) 1500 threat over the life of a battle is not a lot; you'd gain more threat by unequipping and re-equipping your sword and shield and getting SA. For an 8 minute fight we're talking a difference of 3 TPS. We are at best talking marginal differences. If you want bigger differences, you have to maximize your mana-starved damage. To do that, I would imagine you'd have to equip a warrior tanking weapon, use seal of blood if it's available, and rely more heavily on melee damage. Or as I said above, downrank more aggressively, but I've still not seen a source on the downranking coefficients on SoR/JoR.</div>

</div>I don't agree with you, but I honestly think we're mostly at the personal play preference level here.  You are entirely neglecting the case where you fill up your mana pool completely (and then at some point empty it), which I find to be a pretty common case actually, even if the fight itself isn't normally high enough incoming dps  where I can maintain full-bore for any length of time.  OTing Gruul is a great example of this because of the size of the hits.<br>
<br>
I'm not a big fan of Int on gear as a rule, and I'm pretty happy with my ~7k raid buffed (with no desire for any more).  However, I've got to agree that the T5 BP is superior to the Badge one by more than a passing amount (sidebar: what the hell?  those set bonuses?).  HP is good, but loses out to block value and AC in most cases (like this one specificly) since you can pretty much always assume  every hit will be blocked.  You can certainly count me as a T6 tank who stacks block value for quite a few fights, and I run around with a healthy 517 even in my standard suit (my block value suit has me at 840ish), hankering for more.  Because of block adding post mitigation it's highly significant, and since an unblocked hit can crush you should be working pretty damn hard to always be blocking.<br>
<br>
In addition, I'm starting to dislike dodge.  More and more often, it's avoidance streaks which make healers zone out  and fail to bounce back when I start taking regular hits.  I try to keep defense as close to 490 as I can, while keeping dodge +parry to sub 38%.  Healers don't run oom healing me and find me easy to heal specifically because I tend towards steady  high AC/high block/high hp- all dodge and parry do past a point is save healer mana, and our healers tend not to run OOM anymore.<br>
<br>
Gotta say, your idea of swapping out the weapon and back in is absolutely fantastic.  I can do that back and forth for when the boss isn't hitting me for anything noticable (Sup prince?), and that'll make me a little less neurotic.<br>
<br>
On a personal note, I hit my current max hp last night of 22627 hp pre Seed, so I'm pretty happy.  Hopefully I'll be able to snag something other than -Kara gear- in my helm/shoulders slots, but I'm not holding my breath.</div>

</div>You're right, I am. If you can continually refresh your mana to full and then empty it again and do this in a quick cycle, int is going to outperform spelldamage in threat output. In the above case, if you can do this every 2 minutes or so you'll gain a large amount of threat since you'll essentially never be in the OOM state. But then we're talking about a per-fight case, and that becomes...murkier. <br>
<br>
If we're having to find specific fights where int is valuable, I think the point is made: it isn't necessary as a rule on paladin tanking gear, at least not in the general case. This is especially true if you're stacking mitigation and stamina over avoidance. The original point was simply that int is not a needed stat on paladin tanking gear, and I still believe this to be true; paladin raid tanking gear should not be made to work well in a few fights where you'll be OTing. I've still not seen a particularly good example of where int actually excels or is at all useful when MTing. <br>

</div>I don't think that's a reasonable assumption against most bosses. Most normal hits will be blocked, but most bosses do not do the majority of their damage via normal hits that BV will actually reduce. But the point is reasonable. Against some bosses it'll excel, against others it'll not be that big a deal. That points more to the necessity of having the right gear for the right boss more than anything else.<br>
<br>
I don't like the idea of stacking too much block value while gimping avoidance entirely. I think there's a reasonable balance to be had. I still believe that the important thing is to safely maximize damage received so that you don't go OOM on fights but get no more damage than that, and pure avoidance is one factor in this. Avoidance is good to a point. Too much is bad, but too little is also bad. Avoidance doesn't just help with healer mana; it can help avoid some of the worst case scenarios. Mitigation helps keep things run smoothly; avoidance can help when things go to hell. Is that important to gear for? Not always, no. But saying that it's useless after being uncrushable I think is overstating things dramatically, especially given examples of people playing at higher content.<br>
<br>
One last thing to consider in terms of avoidance vs. block value: avoidance also works better when holy shield is not up for whatever reason. This is one of those 'bad cases' that I was talking about earlier. It's not as often as the warrior's case of getting gibbed by an unlucky parry, but random silences or lag can do basically the same thing. And in that case, it is good to be able to more likely avoid damage altogether than it is to rely on blocking the swing.</div>

</div>Actually my point was that there are quite a few fights where you refill, even on cases where it doesn't seem like you would (not continiously, but here and there).  VR, Kael, and frankly most fights I'll get a full refill at -some- point.  I still don't like int on any of my gear, but never will use it as a detractor, it's just a stat I happen to pick up.<br>
<br>
I am not sure where you're getting the idea that most hits are unblockable.  The vast, vast majority of a boss's damage is in normal, physical blockable attacks, or physical specials which are likewise blockable (though the specials may indeed be big enough that a block doesn't 'seem' like more mitigation.  In fact, short of Kael's pyros, hydross's hits, and Leo I can't really think of any boss where this isn't the case.  I'm sure I'm missing a few, but I think it really is the exception that 'more' damage is of the unblockable variety- I'm unable to find any boss on WWS parses for the last 2 weeks where this is the case.<br>
<br>
I also wasn't advocating 'gimping'  dodge/parry, I generally keep dodge + parry + miss at above 45% and below 50%.  Any more and my avoidance  strings can screw with healers, and less and healers might have mana issues.  THat is most definately personal perference (though I think anything under 45% total and you're playing with fire), but it works for me.</div>

</div>I consider this a myth. Healers don't stop healing you whether or not you actually took a hit, so pure avoidance (miss/dodge/parry) contributes to overhealing.<br>
<br>
Rather, mitigation (armor/block value) ALSO contribute to healer mana endurance. While they can't assume when you'll dodge (and hence when to stop healing), they CAN assume that you'll take a certain minimum amount of damage per hit, which is probably something like <b>(boss damage - (mitigation + lifebloom/HOT ticks))</b>. Given this assumption, they can tailor their heals to match. If you can manage to get enough mitigation such that your healers can use rank 1 Greater Heal spam as opposed to rank 7, then you just saved healer mana.<br>

</div>Untrue. The entire concept of being uncrushable is that every single hit comes out as one of the four avoidance events.<br>
<br>
I'm a firm believer that the purpose of our tank gear is to "normalize" damage intake.<br>
We want to become uncrittable so that we don't take 2x hits that make Shaman/Druids scramble for their Nature's Swiftness buttons<br>
We want to become uncrushable so that we don't take 1.5x hits that make Paladins scramble for their max rank Holy Lights.<br>
Once we're past that, we want to stack up on mitigation so that our healers can downrank as much as possible.<br>
<br>
Mob spells don't crit, so damage is "normalized" as far as that is concerned.<br>
Elemental attacks CAN crit, although we can also nullify that, then resistances act as our mitigation.<br>
<br>
That leaves what ... physical attacks that can't be blocked? (I don't know if Gruul's Hateful Strike is one, but it came to mind) Those still go through armor mitigation, and their ability to crit (if at all) can also be nullified.<br>
<br>
I'd like to see an example of a boss attack that is spiky and/or can't be affected by mitigation.</div>

</div>It's not quite a myth for us.  There's occasionally a healer or two (usually a paladin) who will queue up max rank heals and cancel.  Usually there are HoTs on said tank and another paladin spamming FoL, for example.  More avoidance means that paladin cancels more heals, and then lets that big fat heal land when a spike happens, smoothing the gap.  I know we definitely do this at Mother Shahraz, as one example, and I think in general there's one healer on the MT who is following that philosophy.<br>
<br>
But that just may be the way it plays out for our guild, and certainly may not be the case for other guilds.</div>

I am the one who gets the healing aggro and the birds come straight for me. When they get there I consecrate and hold aggro easily. Why have another pally do what a protection pally can do just fine. We use the same strat for the Morogrim fight and it works splendidly.<br>

</div>Grrr, you keep missing the point.  If you're in full tanking gear (pally or warrior), with anywhere under 500 spell damage, healing will A) suck your mana like there's no tomorrow and B) have a chance to actually be out-healed by a priest or druid throwing big heals around.  You make up for this by taking more damage - but all this does is throw the burden onto your healers, and means if a healer or two dies because they mess up you're toast.<br>
<br>
Avenger's Shield + Righteous Defense + Misdirect mean that if you're missing those mobs you're really screwing up.  If you run with a hunter, have them save MD for an o-shit situation where you couldn't grab them.  AS and RD used to be a lot more unreliable, but with the changes to precision and taunt mechanics, they're pretty good nowadays.<br>
<br>
Listen, I'm glad it works for you, and if it does and everyone in your guild is ok with it then more power to you.  I can't recommend this strategy to any new paladin tank looking to off-tank on Al'ar that comes reading this thread.  Your strat requires extreme mana-use, cooperative and very competent healers, a helpful 'lock(having a lock life-tap on your schedule will reduce the effectiveness of their dps cycles as well, but if they're relatively competent it won't be by a ton), and a collection of high damage gear.<br>
<br>
My strategy requires a semi-competent healer, and an occasional emergency misdirect( assuming precision, your shield and righteous defense have ~6% chance to miss.  That means there is a less than 1% chance that both miss either of the two adds that are up ).  It just makes the fight a lot more stable.  The incoming damage is less, taxing your healers a lot less.  You don't need a pocket warlock and they don't need to watch out for you.  You're wearing tank gear, so a bad bunch of spikes (or even back to back explosions) won't mean certain death.<br>
<br>
As for Tidewalker, healing aggro is your only strat due to the number of mobs, and the fact that they hit decently hard.  You can't shield + Righteous Defense more than 6, and you really can't afford for them to be beating on a clothie for even a second.  So you're forced to go to a highly mana inefficient scheme in order to draw aggro.  I hated that fight when I first started, because I was forced to chug mana pots the whole time to keep up.  Al'ar only has 2 adds though, and our tanking tools are designed extremely well to handle that.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I consider this a myth. Healers don't stop healing you whether or not you actually took a hit, so pure avoidance (miss/dodge/parry) contributes to overhealing.<br>
<br>
Rather, mitigation (armor/block value) ALSO contribute to healer mana endurance. While they can't assume when you'll dodge (and hence when to stop healing), they CAN assume that you'll take a certain minimum amount of damage per hit, which is probably something like <b>(boss damage - (mitigation + lifebloom/HOT ticks))</b>. Given this assumption, they can tailor their heals to match. If you can manage to get enough mitigation such that your healers can use rank 1 Greater Heal spam as opposed to rank 7, then you just saved healer mana.</div>

	</tbody></table>
</div>I see this brought up a lot in the effective HP vs. avoidance discussions.  I don't feel that it's a myth at all.  The thought that your healers don't stop healing you implies that your priests do nothing but spam GHeals all day with the occasional renew or PoM, or that your paladins blindly mash their FoL buttons 'til they're blue in the face.  Quite frankly, that's bad healing.  The concept of priest cancel-cast GHeals to sustain a fight accomplishes two things: it allows the heals that do land the ability to greatly reduce the risk of tank death from damage spikes when (not if) they do happen, and it allows them to get out of the FSR on occasion to substantially increase their mana regen.  Paladin healers can be more reactive, and break out their top rank Holy Light when they know a GHeal won't be enough.  There are tons more healing synergies than just this, but it's an example of how smart healing and teamwork can play to your avoidance and use it as a method of sustaining healer mana bars.<br>
<br>
Ultimately, healers need to know that 40+% of the attacks that come your way will miss.  Streaks will happen, both good and bad.  If your healers are falling asleep at the wheel just mashing 1 or 2 buttons repeatedly, that's a flaw in your healing strategy that should be fixed.<br>
<br>
On a side note, I've seen a lot of strat writeups that say certain fights need more healers than they really do (i.e. Morogrim "needs" 9-10 healers, and we usually kill him with 7).  The sloppy healing I described above combined with screwups leading to more raid healing is most likely why people think more healers are needed than what you can truly get by with.  Tanks and DPS are required to do their homework to become the best, most efficient machines they can be... Why not healers as well?</div>

</div>And <i>my</i> point is that if you have a modest amount of +hit (i.e., Precision), the chances of <i>both</i> RD and AS missing is close enough to zero to make no difference, and even if they do both miss you can minimize the downside by having another paladin be the one who gets aggro anyway.  Since you do presumably need a healer while you're tanking the things, why not just use that healer as the aggro magnet?  The holy paladin can heal more efficiently, and thereby generate far more healing threat than you can.  When the adds get to you, a ~150 mana RD gets you all of that healing threat without you having to spend a ton of mana doing the healing yourself.<br>
<br>
And if you use AS, that's going to generate a <i>ton</i> more threat than healing.  What do your heals land for when you're wearing tanking gear?  Perhaps 3k each?  Paladin heals by default generate 25% of the healing value in threat, so at base you're generating 750 threat.  Multiply that by Improved RF and it's 1425 threat.  Unfortunately, healing threat gets <i>split</i> among all mobs in range; since this typically includes Al'ar plus two embers, you're only generating 475 threat on each ember.  Meanwhile a simple non-crit AS would easily generate 1k threat on each ember.  It also casts faster and costs less mana.<br>
<br>
Healing aggro works great on Morogrim, because there are far too many targets to pick up by other means.  But for a 2-3 mob situation, AS is <i>far</i> better.</div>

</div>Sure, smart healers are cancelling instead of blindly spamming.  But there's still a substantial difference between getting hit for, say, 1/3 of your health on a fairly regular basis, and getting hit for 1/2 of your health on a much less regular basis.  The second case is much more stressful for the healers, even if the overall damage taken is lower.  Once a healer cancels a heal and then sees your health take a sharp dive immediately after cancelling, he's going to start second-guessing his cancels every time and go into "shit, I'd better let this one land just in case" mode.  <br>
<br>
Look at the difference between a feral druid and a prot warrior on a high-damage boss like Morogrim or Azgalor.  The prot warrior takes less damage overall, but healers will consistently tell you that the feral is easier to heal because the damage is much more regular.<br>

</div>And if that's the difference you're talking about in avoidance vs. mitigation, that's fine. I don't know of too many bosses that you can actually stack enough mitigation to make that 1/3rd vs. 1/2 health of a difference. I think that you're overstating how avoidance and mitigation really compare to each other.<br>
<br>
I'm starting to look at it more as an overall benefit than anything else based on average damage stopped. For instance, on a mob that hits for 5000, 1% avoidance will effectively be equivalent to 50 mitigated damage. It certainly is better to do 50 mitigated damage on every hit instead of prevent one hit and take 99 others, I agree, but then the question becomes how much better is it? Even if you say that the equivalent avoidance is worth only half that mitigation, we're talking 1% avoidance vs 25 mitigation, and that's somewhat hard to come by as it relates to gear; the itemization costs of block value are too high relative to dodge, and it's not as common to begin with. <br>
<br>
So no, I don't think avoidance is better than mitigation after a certain point, but I think you can reasonably find an equivalence that allows you to compare gear and make a reasonable decision, especially based on the encounter. And as the above indicates, bosses that physically hit for less make mitigation more valuable on a per-point basis. Bosses that hit for more make avoidance more valuable on a per-point basis.</div>

</div>Honestly I don't even think the prot paladin doing the healing aggro is a good strat for everyone. We use holy paladins to pull them in.

</div>Well on TW there's no reason not to heal - I just go for the warlocks and can usually get aggro after 2 heals.  But I do have the other paladins stand with me just in case.  Like I said, you don't want the murlocs hitting a clothie (or even leather or mail really).  But if they hit a holy pally once or twice before my consecrate gets their attention, that's certainly not the end of the world.  But if you're not healing, you're just standing there looking pretty.  Might as well get as much aggro on them as possible, even if that only means you pull them off your pally healer friend 1 second earlier. <br>
<br>
(Using Cathela's math from earlier, and assuming your holy friends heal 3 times what you do, they're gaining ~150-200 threat per mob per heal, while you're much closer to ~100.  So with 2 heals by them, and none by you, you're ~350 threat in the hole, or around 2-4 consecrate ticks to pull aggro.  If you heal as well, you're only ~150 threat in the hole, or 1-2 ticks to pull aggro.)</div>

<br>
<br>
And <i>my</i> point is that if you have a modest amount of +hit (i.e., Precision), the chances of <i>both</i> RD and AS missing is close enough to zero to make no difference, and even if they do both miss you can minimize the downside by having another paladin be the one who gets aggro anyway.  Since you do presumably need a healer while you're tanking the things, why not just use that healer as the aggro magnet?  The holy paladin can heal more efficiently, and thereby generate far more healing threat than you can.  When the adds get to you, a ~150 mana RD gets you all of that healing threat without you having to spend a ton of mana doing the healing yourself.<br>
<br>
And if you use AS, that's going to generate a <i>ton</i> more threat than healing.  What do your heals land for when you're wearing tanking gear?  Perhaps 3k each?  Paladin heals by default generate 25% of the healing value in threat, so at base you're generating 750 threat.  Multiply that by Improved RF and it's 1425 threat.  Unfortunately, healing threat gets <i>split</i> among all mobs in range; since this typically includes Al'ar plus two embers, you're only generating 475 threat on each ember.  Meanwhile a simple non-crit AS would easily generate 1k threat on each ember.  It also casts faster and costs less mana.<br>
<br>
Healing aggro works great on Morogrim, because there are far too many targets to pick up by other means.  But for a 2-3 mob situation, AS is <i>far</i> better.</div>

</div>I did not think you were personally attacking me, I felt you were second guessing my threat generation without taking into account that I would be the person healing.<br>
<br>
With RF active +some spell damage gear which also helps me hold threat it is nearly impossible (if not downright impossible, without someone purposely trying to take aggro from me) for me <u>not</u> to have more threat on add's then anyone else. 2 big heals and the adds are mine, i throw up some FoL until they get to me and consecrate. Also of course all other healers have Blessing of Salvation on, so my heals are easily generating more threat then theirs.<br>
<br>
<br>
As many people have stated most Protect have multiple gear they wear for certain encounters. For Al'ar I use less protection without losing stamina and add more +spell damage.<br>
<br>
I suggest watching the video I posted to see how well it works and perhaps you will see how easily the adds come.<br>
<br>
I am not questioning that having a Holy pally get the aggro for me, and then I take it away, is not also a valid way to do this, I'm merely suggesting that this is perhaps the best way to utilize protection paladin goodness on the Al'ar fight. If you can do it with 10 murlocs on Morogrim, you can easily do the same with 2 adds on Al'ar. The heals from other folks easily get my mana back to sufficient amounts without me going mana pot crazy.</div>

		<div id="post_message_576933">Has there been math done on the exact equivalency points (like a rogue's AEP) for certain stats?  I see in the first post you compare the mitagtion points to 1% to uncrushable, but what about things like stamina, intellect, mp/5, and spell damage?<br>
<br>
I'm looking for something I can use with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304042307/http://www.curse.com/downloads/details/8214/" target="_blank">Pawn addon</a>, which assigns a certain point value to each stat, and then adds it up - it's an easy and fast way to tell what gear is best.  I believe there's a mod called 'tank points' or something, that's similar.<br>
<br>
From the OP I divided 1 by each of the values needed to get 1%, and then multiplied by 10 so they're a bit bigger than hundreths of a point (so something with a block value of 18 is seen as more than .03 higher than a value of 15)<br>
<br>
BlockRating=1.26<br>
DefenseRating=0.6<br>
DodgeRating=0.5<br>
ParryRating=0.4<br>
Agility=0.4<br>
<br>
Now, who's done the math that says 'X' stamina will increase your survival as much as 'Y' armor?  Where do I rate Stamina, ArmorRating, SpellDamage, Intellect, MP/5, etc?  I'd like to know, for example, at what point does higher armor become better than the defense on an item.  Should I drop 22 defense for 15 block rating?  Etc.<br>
<br>
I've searched this thread, I didn't see anything under 'pawn string', 'tank points' or 'equivalency points'...<br>
<br>
I understand that we're stacking to a goal, and the closer you get to said goal, the less a certain is important.  However, just as a general guideline...</div>

		<div id="post_message_577034">Defense, dodge and parry don't do anything for your burst survivability, as "burst" by definition is "a string of hard hits during a short period of time", which means none were dodged/parried/misses. Granted more avoidance will reduce how often it happens, but not affect your ability to survive it. Eventually it's generally agreed on that what decides if you live through the fight or not is your stamina/armor/block value, since these DO affect how much burst you're able to take before you die. Stamina works always, however armor/block value's effect depends. Armor depends on what portion of the burst is magical, and block value depends on how many blockable attacks the burst included. Figure these out and you can find armor-&gt;stamina and block value-&gt;stamina conversion values based on your current stats and definition of "burst" for the fight you're tanking.<br>
<br>
For example if "burst" means 2 normal attacks and a magical instant attack, 1 block value (after talents...) equals 2 HP, 1 stamina 10 HP.<br>
<br>
With 15k HP somewhere around 12-13k armor, 1200-1300 more armor will  give about 1500 more HP equivalent against non-magic attacks. If your burst dmg taken is 2/3 physical, it would give 1000 HP equivalence. (see protection warrior thread for accurate values, as well as other threads around discussing armor).<br>
<br>
Of course these are just very specific examples to show you how to actually calculate the stat values when you actually know what boss you're fighting against and what kind of burst you're trying to survive.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>avoidance and mana conservation</b><br>
While dodging more will generally result in more heals being canceled and more mana saved, this isn't a straight up conversion. For example a 50% avoidance tank will take quite a lot more than 1/2 the healing of a 0% avoidance tank. This is based on the fact that not all heals can be canceled in time and sometimes you just have to let them fly due to latency, minimum human reaction time, and any other reason I hadn't thought about.<br>
In addition, when you take 1 big hit and the next will come before the heal lands, the healers will assume it will land and cast an appropriate size heal - and overheal if you dodge because they don't want to risk a tank death by canceling a heal when the tank isn't full HP.<br>
All of these factors and any other I didn't think about greatly reduce the value of avoidance for saving healers mana, however obviously more avoidance = more healer mana. It's just not nearly as much as you think.<br>
<br>
On top of avoidance not being a major mana saver for healers, increasing HP also helps healers save mana... The bigger buffer you have the bigger choice healers have for which heals to use and suddenly they will be able to cancel the heal from the above example because they don't really have to keep you 100% anymore. So more stamina also results in more healer mana, which makes me wonder why ever gear for avoidance to save healer's mana, when stamina both saves healer mana and makes you able to survive fights better. While math needs to be done about it, I can bet stamina will give at least similar values to avoidance in terms of healer mana saved in a fight.<br>
<br>
So since healer mana is not an issue, and avoidance is very possibly not even saving healer mana more than stamina/armor/BV do, and eventually you <b>will</b> encounter a situation in which higher stamina/armor/BV could've saved you for sure while additional avoidance would only <b>maybe</b> save you, why bother discussing avoidance over just stacking the stats that actually matter?<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Short version:</b><br>
While avoidance saves healer mana, it doesn't save as much as the % number says, as well as stamina/armor/BV saving healer mana as well both via dmg reduction and via higher buffer.<br>
Avoidance will eventually fail. Stamina will never fail, armor will never fail against physical non-bleed damage and block value will never fail against any realistic melee boss.<br>
While you may be able to figure out how much avoidance is as useful as how much burst survivability, you'll probably get some crazy values that will require a LOT of avoidance to make up for very little stamina/armor/mitigation loss, and even that would have to assume your healers are capable of running oom due to tank damage taken.</div>

		<div id="post_message_577048">To my mind, avoidance as a mechanism to save healer mana is a pretty unpersuasive argument.  Healers don't go OOM anyway, and if they are you give them a SP; plus, it's *very* hard to measure how successful cast-cancelling actually is, which makes me distrust it.<br>
<br>
However, the big thing that avoidance does is reduce the impact of healer error.  Healer casts FoL when they should have gone for the home-run HL?  Avoidance might save you.  Healer out of position or healing another target?  Avoidance might save you.  <br>
<br>
And that's valuable, too, especially if you don't trust your healers or if there are other stresses in the fight that might interfere with their ability to heal you like movement or a silence or whatever.</div>

You may be getting enough mana back from SA to make up the difference, but if that's the case you could be wearing much better mitigation gear and using AS/RD to grab the adds, making things easier for your healers.</div>

</div>It's *much* more expensive to stack enough stamina to take another hit, in many cases, than it is to accept a % failure rate contingent on a bunch of other things going wrong.  Maybe your healers are on the ball 90% of the time; it's only 10% of the time that you need one "lucky" dodge/parry/miss out of 2-3 attacks to make you survive.<br>
<br>
Avoidance is not without value.  You are absolutely correct that it isn't reliable in all cases, and also stamina has incredible scaling for us due to our +16% sta talents and AD, but given that we are much less vulnerable to having our aggro/shield block screwed by an unlucky evasion streak than a warrior tank is I think it's a bad idea to slavishly avoid avoidance in all cases.  Dodge and parry do have value over and above attaining uncrushability.</div>

</div>This discussion is really the only discussion worth looking at for non-druid tanks, since warriors and paladins don't have near the flexibility of trading armor for avoidance.  The more I look at the numbers, the more I look to push my effective HP as high as I can while keeping the risk of taking a crushing blow low (I've stopped trying to be crush-immune in favor of more stamina).  There are a number of reasons for this:<br>
<br>
* At 12.6 HP per point of stamina, this is one stat that scales extremely well.<br>
<br>
* Burst damage isn't near the threat it could be (yeah, yeah, beat to death already, but including for completeness).<br>
<br>
* Max HP is our only true defense against attacks that ignore armor (elemental attacks, bleeds, etc), short of the occasional resist-based fight.<br>
<br>
* LoH scales with your stamina.<br>
<br>
* Though not really a tangible benefit, your max HP is the only defensive stat that can be seen by your raid members, leading to a positive psychological effect on your healers.<br>
<br>
* While you technically do take more damage than an avoidance-based tank, healing input will be similar as discussed earlier, and this leads to more mana for you to dump into threat generation.<br>
<br>
* And probably most important is the fact that Ardent Defender's usefulness grows with your max HP.<br>
<br>
This last point is something I've been looking at a lot lately.  Specifically, the amount of incoming damage needed to completely leapfrog AD is much smaller than people might realize.  The equation works out to be Max Health * 35% / (Normal Damage + (70% * Normal Damage)) = 0.35MH / 1.7D, or D = 0.206MH.  So if your target(s) hits for less than 20.6% of your max health or less, AD guarantees that you'll take <i>at least</i> one extra hit before dying.  The less you get hit for in comparison to your max health, the more AD does for you.  Stacking stamina is an easy way to make AD more useful.<br>
<br>
Another thing to look at is the effectiveness of block value with AD active.  Though I haven't actually parsed any logs to truly prove this, it appears that the 30% reduction in damage taken is applied <i>before</i> the damage reduction from blocking (if anyone has proof that this is incorrect, let me know and I'll delete this).  What this means is AD's effectiveness skyrockets against lesser-hitting targets.  Take murlocs on TW for example that hit for around 700 or so normally, and assume a block value of 400 just for argument's sake.  When you're above 35%, each blocked attack lands for 300 damage, but when you're below 35% that value drops to 90 damage -- a 70% reduction in damage taken per hit.  That is a massive difference, and it allows your healers a lot more leeway when they need to pop their oh-shit buttons to get you back up to full.</div>

I know I don't have an ongoing issue with crushing blows, I know I don't mind getting hit as the mana is appreciated for casting as long as its in sustainable chunks.  I tend to tweak my boss-tanking gear towards more hit points as soon as my defense or avoidance starts to climb much over the 490 defence and uncrushable levels.  <br>
<br>
Given this kind of environment...  I suspect pali's will soon be known for having more hit points than warriors, while warriors are known for needing less healing.<br>
<br>
As someone who spent a lot of time on his priest healing...  I also tend to prefer tanks with large stamina pools over high avoidance numbers when it comes time for boss tanking (though on mobs - which a warrior doesn't do well anyway - high avoidance is better).  It let me have more margin for error and lets me use the biggger, more efficient heals.  It's much easier and much less stressful if as a healer you can have a rhythm to your healing, vs. living constantly on the edge of terror as you weigh the opportunity costs of wasted mana (and a wipe later?) vs. an immediate wipe; large stamina pools help a lot in this respect.<br>
<br>
I really do wish there was a way to choose to gear for more armor.  Right now the <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34207"><span><span class="greenname">[Glove Reinforcements]</span></span></a> and Improved devotion aura are about the only real decision I can make to favour armor.</div>

		<div id="post_message_579564">I was going to post about this before and it seems relevant to do so now.<br>
<br>
Avoidance and the best for paladin tanks in following order<ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li><b>Block Rating</b> - increase chance to block a physical attack. Everytime you block you do much more threat generation then any other stat. Also Paladins are blocking machines with imp. holy shield and redoubt. I believe they block more than any tanking class for any type of physical damage mob.<br>
<br>
I can not get over that the more often we bock, the more we block for, the better we are at tanking. also Itemization in block rating gives us a much better ratio to our avoidance stats which give us more chances to add to Stamina, then defense.   <br>
<br>
Blessing of sanctuary <u>requires</u> a Block to deal holy damage against attacker<br>
<br>
Holy shield + redoubt= Both buffs combined equal a 60% increased block chance.  More blocking<br>
<br>
<u>The other avoidance stats</u></li>
<li><b>dodge</b> - will give us a greater chance to "dodge" an attack and thusly gives us no threat generation. However, it may give the healer a temporary break.<br></li>
<li><b>Parry </b> - increases threat by hitting back on targeted mob, however no passive threat generation from missing</li>
</ol><br>
 <br>
<br>
However by looking at trinkets that add Block Rating, you'll find they're all of 3 and 2 of them are lvl 60.<br>
So I'm guessing we need to get our blocking from other pieces for tanking on bosses.<br>
<br>
<i><b>Multi-mob Paladin trinkets</b></i><br>
<a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=27529" target="_blank">Figurine of the Colossus</a><br>
<br>
<a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=31858" target="_blank">Darkmoon Card: Vengeance</a><br>
<br>
<b><i>Boss tanking trinkets</i></b><br>
<a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28528" target="_blank"><b><i>Moroes' Lucky Pocket Watch</i></b></a>  <br>
  - Some disagree with this choice, but I find myself virtually unhittable when I "use" this trinket. <br>
<br>
<a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=31858" target="_blank">Darkmoon Card: Vengeance</a> +51 stamina and Chance when hit gain more threat. This is most likely best for paladins who can hit avoidance and defense caps and just need more HP.<br>
 <br>
Now for both multi-mob and boss trinkets <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29387" target="_blank">Gnomeregan auto-blocker 2000</a><br>
is effectively giving a Paladin an additional damage reduction of 157 and when used that's another 600 reduction in damage. each pt in block value = 3 damage reduction.  I have not used this trinket, yet. However it may be my next badge purchase to test some theories with actual use. I know it's best for "warriors" and shield slam, however with as much blocking as we do this seems like a great trinket for reducing damage of physical attacks on every successful block and activated that's another 600! If I'm doing the stats right that does seem substantial.<br>

</div>No, but you can calculate how many you do block.<br>
<br>
If you're AoE tanking a sufficiently large number of mobs, the time limit on Redoubt becomes irrelevant, because the five charges get used up before the ten seconds expire.  So the chance of having Redoubt up on any given attack is the chance that Redoubt procced on at least one of the last five blows that landed, which is 1 - (0.9)^5 = 40.9%.  <br>
<br>
So Redoubt is up roughly 40% of the time in a high-target tanking situation.  Therefore your average block chance is approximately:<br>
<br>
0.4*(block chance with redoubt) + 0.6*(block chance without redoubt)<br>
<br>
That's ignoring the effect of Holy Shield, which will slightly increase the overall block rate.<br>
<br>
EDIT:  Just realized this is only accurate if your total avoidance with Redoubt up is 100% or greater, since it assumes any hit on you will use a Redoubt charge.  The math needed to calculate Redoubt's uptime if this is not the case would be substantially more complicated (I think).</div>

</div>Yes. I think that has been covered in this thread already, but in any case what you state is correct. Because Redoubt is a proc, you can't count on it for uncrushability. Therefore, it only really comes into play in AOE tanking situations. Rarely, if ever, does a boss have enough hits in 10 seconds to remove all your Holy Shield charges.</div>

In addition, there actually aren't a lot of bosses that hit individually at the 10k level (supremius, Gruul are the only ones who come to mind), and obviously the smaller they hit the more valuable block value is going to be.  30% is highly significant.</div>

</div>I don't think he stated that the difference between having the talent and not was a difference of 500, I think he was using the number 500 to illustrate that even though it only knocks off perhaps 5% from a 10K hit it is still quite useful for mitigation after armor.<br>

</div>I appologise for being unclear.  At my gear point (some T5, some T4, hyjal honored ring) Shield Spec is about 120 block value for me, and I have no illusions that it will realistically scale  up to 500 for 3 points.  I was merely attempting to emphasize how strong shield block is in general, and failed to draw from that that the points in shield spec are quite good because it is a very well scaling benefit to a stat that a lot of newer tanks tend to overlook.<br>
<br>
Honestly, I really wish they would untie Redoubt from SS, because while it is helpful tanking on Hyjal trash waves I find the mobs don't hit all that hard unless the abombs get the stun, at which point it's useless.  On the flip side, because they do stun quite often Redoubt is up considerably more than the 40% figure above (if you ignore the stunned time) and because of the HS procs....but honestly if I go in with over 500 block value the ghouls alone run me oom in no time flat because of the weak hits they toss my way.  I'm not really sure blocking more of nonspikey  easy to heal damage is a good thing.  Imp Devo's ~450 more AC is somewhat appealing, though I freely admit I'm an AC/stam whore.<br>
<br>
Then again, with all the issues with prot speccing a paladin in the first place, this has got to be pretty damn far down on the list.<br>
<br>
Edit:<br>
For clarity's sake, lemme specify that I was referring to the bloated tree design, not the concepts.</div>

Ya I find the abominations to be more of a pain than a real concern.  I pop the free action potions just to help my healers out.  That and hammer of justice every time it's on cooldown.<br>
<br>
I'll have to try the holy water out.  If it works well, it could conceivably help the whole raid (healers could throw a mana-free AoE attack...).  If it does work, means I'll have to start running Strat and Scholo( <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=20520"><span><span class="greenname">[Dark Rune]</span></span></a> ) on a regular basis too.</div>

</div>You'd need a pretty ridiculously high spell damage amount to justify grabbing haste rating over adding more spell damage.  Remember that things like Consecration, Holy Shield, Judgement, and even Exorcism all benefit from spell damage but not from haste rating.  Besides, we already have too many stats to balance as is, why look for another?  </div>

		<div id="post_message_583075">It's a theoretical question, I am not at all suggesting stacking Haste rating I am just wondering mechanics wise, how does it work in relation to SoR the bread and butter threat seal.  And agreed it isn't feasible with any real gear set we have available, but more or less wondering if we get screwed with haste effects or if we benefit immensely from it.<br>
<br>
My question I suppose is this, given that although the damage for SoR is greater at 2.6 speed the DPS/TPS is the same as a 1.6 speed weapon with the minor variance of hit chance modifiers. But if that damage is not modified by Haste effects and essentially you are doing 2.6 weapon speed damage with SoR at let’s say 2.0 weapon speed that would result in a TPS/DPS increase especially when stacked with Windfury and Reckoning.<br>
<br>
It is obviously Theorycraft and the gear that exists for Haste rating on plate is painfully worse then tank gear but I am just brainstorming.<br>
<br>
Essentially if you are in a group with a shaman and receive Bloodlust, I believe that your SoR damage should stay constant despite the increased haste effect, or am I mistaken?</div>

</div>As far as I've seen, SoR damage per hit stays the same under haste effects.  <br>
<br>
<br>
But I have a question about your idea - what does it matter what speed weapon you have?  <br>
<br>
When hasted by 30%, you swing 30% more often, effectively gaining 130% weapon DPS.   If you swing 30% more often, you'd gain 30% more SoR DPS.  <br>
<br>
So you'd get the same % benefit to SoR DPS regardless of what weapon speed you use.</div>

<br>
Haste (via bloodlust or any other effect) will increase the damage done by the same percentage no matter how fast you are swinging. I guess my point is, you will hit as hard whether your 2.6 speed weapon is swinging at 2.6 or 2.0, and since autoattack can be faster than gcd, haste will not benefit a 2.6 speed weapon any more than a 1.8 speed weapon.<br>
<br>
Reckoning, however, can benefit from a slower weapon under the effects of haste, as haste does not reduce the duration of the reckoning buff. So, the point you should be examining is how reckoning+haste interact, and not SoR+Haste.</div>

		<div id="post_message_585099">I've been going over the thread again, and there were some things brought up earlier that never truly got answered.<br>
<br>
<b>Reckoning vs. 1h Spec</b><br>
<br>
I know this was a topic of debate earlier on now that the Protection tree is more bloated than ever, and the only math I really saw on the subject just says they're close enough not to matter.  But having gone from a spec without Reckoning when 2.3 hit back to a spec that has it now, I can safely say I don't ever want to tank without it again.  With Reckoning I can safely use SoV (sorry horde) to achieve its higher "on paper" threat generation compared to SoR without worry of losing the 5-stack.  Reckoning is also amazing on AoE pulls for Seal/Judgement of Wisdom or even Light if survivability is a concern.<br>
<br>
The only cases I can see 1h Spec being a clear winner on are offtank situations where you're not constantly being attacked (Gruul, VR, etc.).  And even then you're still getting hit often enough to still get an occasional Reckoning proc, so it's not a total waste.<br>
<br>
Ultimately, the math would need to come down to looking at the number of damaging attacks that hit you over a period of time to figure out the typical number of Reckoning procs to look at.  The ugliness comes in figuring out all the different scenarios and taking into account the number of mobs hitting you at once.<br>
<br>
<b>Value of Improved Judgement</b><br>
<br>
In looking over various websites and armory profiles, I see a lot of inconsistencies in regards to this talent.  The OP mentioned utilizing Improved Judgement while the GCD is active to get more total judges in over the course of a fight.  Personally, I don't like this idea at all because it means you're going to have white swings hit your target without an active seal to benefit from (essentially diminishing or even eliminating the benefit of more frequent Judgements).  I've run for awhile now w/o Improved Judgement and just treat HS/Judge/Consecration as all being part of my 10-second cycle, and I haven't missed it once.  If anyone has a good reason to pull 2 points out of Prot for this talent, I'd love to hear it.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Lastly, for Chicken...  If you're still reading, I'd love to see a breakdown of what to do in ZA as a prot pally, much like you've done for the other zones.  I have yet to see Zul'Jin myself, but the rest of the zone almost seems as it was custom built for pally tanks (mostly because that's where I hear the most "nerf pally" comments from our warriors, all in good fun  ).  Trash to Eagle, Dragonhawk, and Lynx is basically trivialized by bringing a prot pally.  Hex Lord is definitely made easier with a pally to handle 2-3 adds at once, and I'd hate to think of how to drop Dragonhawk without one of us in the mix.</div>

<br>
As for imp judgement, while I don't know if it's actually worth the points, it definitely will increase your TPS if used properly. Generally if you judge during a GCD but reseal before the next white attack, you will not lose any seal attacks. So if you're not during GCD when judgement comes off cooldown - judge and reseal. If resealing's GCD would collide with a more important ability, wait for next swing and then judge - and reseal when you can again. The slower your weapon the more you gain from improved judgement. Don't expect to judge every 8s on the clock, though, but you'll definitely be judging more often with 8s CD on judgement than with 10s CD.</div>

<br>
My biggest concern with Imp. Judgement is that it <i>will</i> butt up against your HS/Consecration cycle.  Since those two things are almost always more important than the judge/reseal combo, it means either a) judge and get 1-2 nonseal white swings, or b) wait on the judgement (in which case the talent points offer no benefit).  I agree that it <u>can</u> increase your threat generation in certain cases, but I can't justify the two talent points needed to make this happen.</div>

		<div id="post_message_585186">The thing is you don't always have to wait until you can actually reseal. Often (especially with slower weapons) you can judge right after a weapon swing when you can't reseal but you'll be able to reseal before your next white swing anyway.<br>
<br>
For example:<br>
T=0: melee swing, judgement cooldown up, holy shield needed - cast holy shield and judge right after the melee swing.<br>
T=1.5: You can reseal.<br>
T=&lt;weapon speed&gt;: Autoattack with seal active.<br>
<br>
As you can see with a weapon slower than 1.5s in this specific scenario you'd have 1.5s of no seal yet not lose any sealed attacks. With slower weapons those scenarios will make more benefit as you're more likely to have the 1.5s included within your autoswing timer, but even if your autoswing was at 0.75s for example, you could judge immidiately after that instead of waiting for T=1 or T=2 (depending if 0/2 or 1/2 imp judgement).<br>
<br>
I doubt the benefit is huge, but I've yet to see a spreadsheet to actually take this into account and compare imp judgement to non imp judgement (for neither ret nor prot), assuming <b>you can have 100% of your white attacks be affected by the seal without having 100% seal uptime.</b></div>

		<div id="post_message_585456">Everyone should agree that ZA needs 2 tanks. We'll be under the assumption the other tank is either warrior/druid<br>
I'll do the basics on the pulls for pallies without going into detail on how the pulls should actually go unless the paladin is doing anything out of the ordinary<br>
<br>
THIS IS MAINLY FOR THOSE JUST ENTERING ZA. If you are in Tier5 or above you may do some of this differently, but if you're just going into the zone and haven't full cleared it to Zul'jin and aren't even close to doing the timed event. Then this will be good information for you.<br>
<br>
<u><i><b>Akil'zon (Eagle Boss)</b></i>]</u><br>
<br>
<b>Pulls to eagle boss </b><br>
<br>
The Paladin pulls the raid up the hill always tanking the static mobs and birds. <br>
  - Just go up the hill using consecration whenever you see the birds swarming, I usually just use it whenever the CD is up. <br>
  - The paladin controls the momentum, if you have good healing I wouldn't use CD's on trinkets or Holy SHield, unless you need to. That way you're taking more damage and can get more mana to continue consecrating. When you get to the top kill the mini boss, get mana up and attack eagle. <br>
<br>
The other tank runs defense behind, picking up Elite adds that spawn behind group.<br>
<br>
<b>Tanking Eagle boss. (Don't)</b><br>
 - Frankly I don't tank the eagle boss, I have a great healing set and find it's more beneficial to let the other tank do the tanking and I help heal. even in protection spec I can bust out some great healing without running OOM and it's a huge help to the group.<br>
<br>
<i><b><u>Nalorakk (Bear Avatar)</u></b></i><br>
<br>
<b>Pulls to the boss</b><br>
 - You don't have to pull half the mobs, I just take the first add I see, have the other tank pick up the other add, sheep/CC any remaining adds. On the big mounted bear ones, be consecrating and keep them separated from each other, watch that you move your target away from CC'd adds to avoid breaking it.<br>
<br>
<b>Tanking Nalorakk</b><br>
  - I take the humanoid phase<br>
  - Other tank takes the Bear phase<br>
    - During the bear phase I stand there and help heal the other tank when he gets 2 debuffs on him and basically wait to taunt him off when he switches back to humanoid. (easy stuff)<br>
<br>
<b><i><u>Jan'alai (Dragonhawk Avatar)</u></i></b><br>
Pulls to boss <br>
 - Kill flamecasters first, I've found that going in with heavy threat generation in the first 5 secs is best. then using hammer of justice, followed up with seal of justice. Consecration is not a good idea, unless you're not CC'ing another flamecaster or you've moved to a safe place.<br>
 - Kill the handlers before killing the dragonhawks, simple consecration, etc...<br>
<br>
Boss fight (more DPS and different raid make up's will need to tweak this strat) <br>
 - Let the other tank take the boss<br>
 - Paladin tanks will be picking up one of the Hatchers that spawn at the bottom of the steps and run to the top and then head to either bridge. I continue to hit my hatcher until the first hatchling appears. I also will throw out an Avenger's Shield when both Hatchers are at the top of the step to slow them down for a few seconds. Judge the first hatchling to spawn, when you see 2 other hatchlings spawn, start consecrating near the end of the bridge (boss side). let 3 more hatchlings spawn, then 4 more, Kill Hatcher before 5 hatchlings spawn. (That's a total of 10hatchlings that will be on you for eatch Hatcher phase. Keep consecration up and be ready to run there if you get ported to the middle, RD your healers, stun, etc... With a warlock seeding and  mage AOE the hatchlings should die quickly.<br>
<br>
I do switch my hatcher side for each hatcher spawn until boss reaches 35% at which point all remaining eggs hatch!<br>
If things are done well, not that many will hatch, What I do is stand on the right bridge and pick up those hatchlings with consecrate. I have a mage on the left bridge Frost nova their hatchlings, I then HIGH TAIL it to mages side and start consecrating. HOPEFULLY, all the adds will group up on me and be AOE'd down. <br>
If you make it past this part it's easy cakes.<br>
*note* during the hatchling phase you can get ported to the middle, you must find a clear area to stand to as not get blown up by the fire bombs. I look for a clear area and move to it, it can be very hard when all the hatchlings pop up at once, do your best. May take you a few times to get it down.<br>
<br>
<b><i><u>Halazzi (Lynx Avatar)</u></i></b><br>
<br>
Pulls to boss<br>
- AOE the groups, easy stuff, pull raid along as quickly as possible if you're doing it for timed. Best to AOE down the large groups and single target the 4 or less packs. Have the other tank pick up the elites on the Large groups (if you want) otherwise you should be able to handle all the mobs yourself. <br>
<br>
Halazzi (Lynx Avatar) tanking<br>
  - I had my guild go in the room, make a right go to the wall and charge from the side. Healers stand where we are pre-pull. That way I always know where the spirit lynx (to the healers I've found!) is going and makes it easy to place my consecration and pick up the spirit lynx. I'll get a SS to show you folks next time we go there.<br>
<br>
  - I have the other tank do the main tanking<br>
  - during the single phase stand on top of the Main tank. use Holy shield whenever you can to minimize Saber damage. I also help heal the MT after a saber lash (FoL) to make sure his HP gets up quickly (have a healer dedicated to you!)<br>
<br>
Once the spirit lynx pops (have a macro /tar spirit) 3 things should happen<br>
 - it gets hit by consecration which should be under the boss but on the healer side<br>
 - hit lynx with judgement of righteousness<br>
 - if those 2 fail to get that lynx on you use Righteous Defense and then Avengers shield<br>
<br>
we do not DPS the lynx, just OT it and put whatever judgements you want on boss, of course keep threat up on Lynx. After he goes back into the boss, just stand on the MT again to absorb saber lashes until lynx pops up.<br>
rinse and repeat.<br>
<br>
<b><i><u>Hex-lord Malacrass</u></i></b><br>
<br>
not even going to bother talking about pulls (they're easy)<br>
<br>
Boss fight - Again I let the other tank pick up Malacrass. You could as well, but I find that helping to CLEANSE/heal after the adds are dead is more beneficial to the group then the us tanking. ( I wear my full tanking gear and only switch out my weapon and shield after adds are dead).<br>
<br>
Kill 3-4 adds- <br>
We have tank charge in, I pick up the 1st add to kill, pull him to a safe place, start consecrating and DPS in on add, then we go for the 2nd add, same thing, pull it to a safe place DPS it down, 3rd add, if you're doing great then pick up the 4th add as well and kill it, if things aren't looking good then do 3. I save the 4th add for our strongest CCer.<br>
<br>
Again after adds are dead just be on Cleanse duty! that is very important and you cleansing lets your other healers concentrate on healing. I also highly recommend keeping the Concentration aura up for this fight as well as using Divine shield if at any point things look like they're about to go bad during a shadow channeling phase (usually near the 4-5th phase). <br>
<br>
<b><i><u>Zul'jin</u></i></b><br>
I wear full healing gear - I tank the adds (very easy just make sure you have a dedicated healer for the first 5 secs) AOE the adds down, let the other tank pick up Zul'jin.<br>
Pally cleansing and Big heals are more important than having you tank. Suck it up and Off heal/cleanse!</div>

</div>Thanks for the note.  In looking your diagram over, it's worth noting that you made this work by moving the Consecration cast around as needed to accommodate the recasting of your seal, which works out to be the same number of Consecration casts you'd get without Improved Judgement during the 40-second window.  In most cases this works out to be a good thing, but there are certain fights where you can't afford the 1.5s w/o Consecration down (FLK hunter pet spawning, for example).  Still, it's nice to see how it can work.<br>
<br>
In regards to the Jan'alai fight (dragonhawk), has anyone tried using fire resist gear to tank the adds?  Up until now I've been using a moderate amount (128) just to reduce the frequency of the debuffs in case we get too many adds up at once.  But even with ~27% reduction, recount still showed roughly 2/3 of my total damage intake for the fight from fire damage.  I'm up to 250 resist now with the aura active, so the next time we head that way I'm going to give it a shot to see how it pans out.  My hunch is with enough resistance, you can tank an entire side's worth of spawns without putting too much of a burden on your healers.<br>
<br>
Also, a Frost Trap between the torches by each bridge makes picking the spawns up a trivial task.  Our healers don't have to worry about where they stand anymore now that we've started doing this.  If you don't have a hunter, Earthbind Totem is another (less effective) alternative.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">We've been killing hydross for EXACTLY 3 months now (First kill was 8/13/07) and our add tanks never use resist gear.  We just have 5 tanks for that fight.  The two hydross tanks have maxed out FrR and NR but our add tanks have 0 resistance gear on.  We just go in with our normal tanking gear.  This strategy has worked brilliantly for us and we never have any problems with it.<br>
<br>
We put all 5 tanks into one group.  When the phase change happens, everyone picks up their designated elemental and drags them together.  We have our deep holy priests SPAM Circle of Healing on the tank group and give them a shadow priest.  What ends up happening is that DPS opens up with AOE as soon as the adds are in the middle and we nuke them down FAST.  We have never hit enrage or come even remotely close.  This also requires 6-7 healers MAX because AOE healing (Especially COH) is just so efficient here!<br>
<br>
I don't see why any guild would put their members through the completely unnecessary step of gathering up resist gear for the add tanks in this fight.  The hydross tanks need maxed out resists but add tanks can go with 0 if you got enough tanks to pick up 1 add per tank.  Bringing in more tanks doesnt slow DPS down because the AOE can just push a lot harder and they end up having more time to DPS hydross himself.</div>

				In looking over various websites and armory profiles, I see a lot of inconsistencies in regards to this talent. The OP mentioned utilizing Improved Judgement while the GCD is active to get more total judges in over the course of a fight. Personally, I don't like this idea at all because it means you're going to have white swings hit your target without an active seal to benefit from (essentially diminishing or even eliminating the benefit of more frequent Judgements). I've run for awhile now w/o Improved Judgement and just treat HS/Judge/Consecration as all being part of my 10-second cycle, and I haven't missed it once. If anyone has a good reason to pull 2 points out of Prot for this talent, I'd love to hear it.
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>From the calculations I did, the first point of improved judgment works out to be about a .8% TPS increase, the second a .5% increase. The main reason you'd want to get it is for utility; it is nice to be able to judge more quickly in a variety of situations (for instance, when you're not running HS). But in terms of actual increase in TPS, it is not nearly as good as other talents you can get.<br>
<br>
Here was the 40-second cycle <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302210905/http://www.failsafedesign.com/maintankadin/viewtopic.php?t=4223&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=15" target="_blank">that Lore figured out</a> with improved judging and assuming HS must stay active:<br>
0.0 HS<br>
0.0 Judge<br>
1.5 Consecration<br>
3.0 SoR &lt;- lost 3 seconds of SoR<br>
8.0 Judge<br>
10.0 HS<br>
11.5 Consecration<br>
16.0 Judge<br>
16.0 SoR<br>
20.0 HS<br>
21.5 Consecration<br>
24.0 Judge<br>
24.0 SoR<br>
30.0 HS<br>
31.5 Consecration<br>
32.0 Judge<br>
33.0 SoR &lt;- lost 1 second of SoR<br>
40.0 HS<br>
40.0 Judge &lt;- back to where we started <br>
<br>
This gives a total of 4 seconds of downtime of SoR (10%) in exchange for 25% more judgments. With this cycle you cannot avoid missing at least one swing with SoR, will almost certainly miss two, and could easily miss 3. Still, that's not the way to think about it statistically; think about it as missing 10% of all sealed swings. If you introduce latency into the mix, it gets even worse. <br>
<br>
Also, while I can understand that in theory you can avoid a miss by being very careful with your swing timer, in practice I believe this to be absolutely flawed for analysis purposes. Real-world examples can't do this reliably and being off by .1s will throw this - and that doesn't even take into account parrying attacks which will speed up your swing timer and throw that all to hell. There's simply no way to avoid missing some sealed attacks with improved judgment being used. Slower swing times will decrease that risk but there's no way to eliminate it completely.</div>

</div>Right.  I was assuming a fight where crush-removal was the primary concern.  FLK adds are level 72, so it's a different concern.  For what it's worth though, I'm pretty sure there's some kind of delay between when the pet spawns and when it starts moving, because I'm not really religious about keeping Consecration up constantly and I've never had trouble with the add running off as long as I'm doing it once every ten seconds or so.<br>

</div>I've single-tanked a full side with somewhere between 200 and 270 resist (not sure whether I was wearing three or four of the epic FR pieces.  The rest of my gear is all T5+, so one could argue that I'm overgeared for this boss.  <br>
<br>
The main concern when doing this is getting the teleport/grenade sequence while you're gathering up the adds; the consecration stays in the same place and keeps ticking so that's fine, but when you've got ~20 birds around you it can be easy to miss one of the grenade bubbles and eat a large chunk of damage.<br>
<br>
Anyway, once you do one side you can just bubble off the debuff before you do the other side.<br>

Note that his fire bombs seem to despawn the hatcher or something so if he does that while eggs are being hatched you'll just have to wait for another spawn to aoe the rest (but should grab and aoe what you already have). Note that while the fire eggs are being thrown around you can still go back and concecrate again and only really have to move to a safe spot a few seconds later, so you don't get any dragonhawks loose.<br>

		<div id="post_message_585943">To be honest the only reason your should not maintank anything in ZA besides the dragonhawk boss is when you have a protection warrior in your group or your bear tank is heavily outgearing you. I'm one of the 3 MT's in my guild besides 2 protection warriors and we have 2 bears and 2 dps warriors around for any offtanking. I only ever tried tanking ZA together with a prot war but u lack some dps usually then. If 3 healers aren't going to keep everyone in ZA alive then either your people don't pass the retard check for the fights or the healers don't live up to the standard for ZA.<br>
<br>
I rather have a dps warrior/feral druid to get the eagle boss down faster then go healing and let healers and dps slack on movement. And you sure as hell aren't gonna beat the timer by swapping a dps for a healer on a fight.</div>

On Dragonhawk, I can easily tank an entire side of birds at once. The only problem was that everyone would lag to hell and back, and if we got a bomb spawn while I have 20 birds on me...I cannot see anything and am getting like 5fps... God save my soul from a bomb.<br>

Also....it is easier to kill the spawned lynx (because he takes more damage) than dps the boss on lynx (when they split). Not sure why you would do it the other way.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">We had a paladin in badge+T4 gear, easily held aggro on an entire side of spawns when we killed 1 of the hatchers right off the bat. Then AOE can go in and clean a whole side fast. Next time he spawns hatchers you clean up the other side and you're set. Note that his fire bombs seem to despawn the hatcher or something so if he does that while eggs are being hatched you'll just have to wait for another spawn to aoe the rest (but should grab and aoe what you already have). Note that while the fire eggs are being thrown around you can still go back and concecrate again and only really have to move to a safe spot a few seconds later, so you don't get any dragonhawks loose.<br>

</div>Holding aggro isn't the problem; survival is.  If your group gets ported to the middle while you have 20+ birds on you, chances are good your healer just had a heal interrupted and now has to resort to instants because he needs to move to an area clear of bombs.  We just dropped this guy again last night, and with my now 250 fire resist my healer (my wife) noticed a HUGE difference in my longevity.  Ultimately I ended up tanking an entire side, bubbling out of the debuffs, repeating the process on the other side, then DPS was free to burn the boss.  Not once was I at risk of dying.<br>
<br>
You can do this guy with less FR than that, but you need to be far more cautious with how many birds you let spawn.  This is definitely an example of a fight where extra gear turns it into a joke.<br>
<br>
I have to disagree with the eagle boss being easier with a heavier amount of DPS than heals.  Yes, it's easier to make the timer, but if you've already blown it we've found him <i>much</i> easier when I switch into healing gear and let someone else tank him.  After the first storm, the amount of damage the raid sustains is pretty much constant for the rest of the fight.  Slow and steady definitely makes it take longer, but you're far less likely to lose a teammate this way.  Again, it comes down to your group's gear vs. the level of the encounter.  Guilds in BT aren't going to need to be anywhere near as cautious as guilds just entering 25-man content.</div>

</div>I found this fight to be the easiest one in the entire instance really, it's quite quick and fun. We use a MT Prot war with me as OT prot pally. For the dragonhawk boss, we kill one hatcher and let the other one through, drop a the aoe slowing freeze at the entrance to the little bridge path they walk on for the birds - and then we let the entire side through. I put a concecrate kinda near the little torch, so that it covers the exit of the pathway and every bird comes directly to me. I pretty much just spam holy shield and concecrate while the hawks are pretty much AOE'd and dps'd down. I use Fire resist aura and it's all I need, and I make sure a healer is spamming a cleanse on me for the fire buff just incase i get breathed. It's all the resist I need, infact I've never died from it. I have no problems surviving either, we use 3 healers and they are easily able to keep me alive. One is focused on me, and if we have a druid I'll have hots which are nice. When the bombs go off and everyone is warped to the middle, the birds are still slowed from the trap usually and dont fly to me right away so there is pleanty of time for a heal if im low, as well as there is pleanty of time to find a safe spot and heal me for the healers. I then just run back to the spot, concecrate again on top of them then just wait for the bombs to pop. Right after the bombs pop the side is cleared usually and we do the same on the other side. We only go through 1 bomb on each side while having them all released. <br>
<br>
I'm only in Badge/T4/starting t5 gear and with this strategy the fight is really a joke. Our guild is only 2-3 bosses in tk and 3 bosses in ssc and really the trash pull going to eagle up the ramp is more difficult than the dragonhawk boss fight... but that's only because we make it with timers with the warrior on top and me on bottom, and our RL is too afraid to let me go up top since we have the timer down with the war even though it would be significantly easier.</div>

		<div id="post_message_587736">I've tanked most of the ZA bosses as a pally (bear, eagle, dragonhawk, linx).  Tanking the dragonhawk adds is not really about survivability as much as it is getting sufficient aggro on all the birds.  The simplest way I've found is to clear one complete side (kill one hatcher), skip the 2nd hatcher spawn (kill both), then deal with the other side.  It is also advisable to mark the living hatcher on the first spawning as it will attempt to run across to the other platform and hatch the second side.<br>
<br>
I have a fire resist gear-set that gives me +237 FR with my resist aura active.  I have about 16k hp in my resist gear and the healers barely look at me.  With a full debuff stack (+90% fire dmg at x30) I take about 750 dmg per hit (per GrimReaper).  The reason threat is more important is to keep your AoE alive. 2-3 well geared AoEers will take down the adds no problem and usually before the first teleport.  If the teleport occurs, then the dragonhawks should follow you into the room. Staying out of the bombs, consecrate should take down the rest.  The encounter is extremely easy after that, just race the enrage timer.<br>
<br>
AoEers: mage/loc and usually an additional of either or a shaman dropping a magma totem.  More DPS is preferred here so any dragonhawks that attempt to attack your AoE will die before getting there (ie the last few that spawn and haven't sat in the consecration all that long)<br>

		<div id="post_message_587880">For janalai:<br>
I've had issues sometimes where a port happens while several dragonhawks are still en route and a consecrate tick doesnt go off on them or only goes off once. otherwise ive never really needed to wear FR, even with an entire side on me my chance of dying to spike damage was less of a random element as was a badly timed port leading to a few unaggroed birds. <br>
<br>
For lynx: ive tanked this 3 or 4 times now, but would spike dangerously low, and have died  a couple times from incredible damage spikes during a frenzy. Just standing there while the bear MT's seems to work much more safely from what ive seen.<br>
<br>
Generally I insist on MT'ing every boss besides the above 2, unless a prot warrior is in the raid, as i feel my usefulness compared to a feral druids is more limited when im not tanking. The extra healing i put out, while helpful, doesn't really make the difference between a win and loss, and the good dps and buffs the druid has are more popular.<br>
<br>
For those getting started I'd also suggest trying to be main cleanser , even when tanking. I could cleanse flameshocks on the shaman phase on lynx, because people would be switching dps to the totems, giving me a stable cushion of a threat lead on the lynx cat.<br>
<br>
 On malacress I got enough of a threat lead while people killed adds that I i cleansed off all the moonfires and anything else cleansable during that fight. The healers are usually spamming a lot of raid heals, and not having to burn GCD's on multiple dispels can relieve a lot of  stress on malacress. <br>
<br>
On zuuljin of course i'd take off my own paralysis but needed to be more careful on threat that fight. On one particular kill that I MT'd i had an impossible time getting aggro on the dragonhawk phase - i'm not sure what happened but I actually had 3 people pulling it off me right away and finally the feral druid ended up MT'ing it (wearing his dps gear so was crittable but that last phase is pretty weak dps on the tank) because i couldnt get it back. but I started out with an AS crit so it was surprising to me. I'd need to check logs next fight but am guessing i get far fewer holy shield procs with the dragonhawk compared to the other phases because of his reduced melee time. <br>
Mana wasnt a major issue so i cast a lot of holy lights during the eagle phase, which is the one phase where the extra heals can be particularly helpful, and quickly regained my mana back on lynx phase. <br>
Because of the bear phase overpower, feral druid tanks are subject to very spikey damage on zuuljin, something less of a factor for us as well</div>

</div>Umm no.  SoV is extremely useful.  Check page 2 of this very thread, where Fiola does some theory crafting on it: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302210905/http://elitistjerks.com/521371-post68.html" target="_blank">Post 68</a> (there are some corrections made on the following page).<br>
<br>
There are certainly situations where it's not worth it.  But to say it sucks, well that's just false.  (Grammar Nazi in me would like to point out that "alot" is actually 2 separate words - "a lot" ).</div>

SoV typically takes 10-15 seconds to ramp up fully (... this would be the time during most fights where threat generation would be *most* important) on an equal-level mob.

</div>To be fair, in an AoE situation it really doesn't matter if you judge.  If you're not holding aggro solely with consecrate, ret aura and holy shield, then you're not going to be very successful anyway.<br>
<br>
The weapon speed issue is annoying, but it's not that deal breaking.  It's very, very seldom that I have a stack fall off on a stationary target.  I generally have a 5-stack up within 2 judgements,<br>

As for the starting generation, A) I find that as a pally tank the first few seconds to be the easiest, as I start with a full mana bar and I can front-load a lot of my threat, and B) no one out there says you have to use only one or the other.  Mana isn't generally a concern for me, and I will actually judge righteousness once or twice while letting my SoV stack get up to full.<br>
<br>
It's certainly not the end-all judgement.  I won't use it for Al'ar's adds for example, they just don't stick around long enough.  But if you're dismissing it outright I think you're making a mistake.  Go back to VR, basically a static fight from a tank's PoV.  Say it takes you 8 minutes to beat him.  If you're a typical paladin tank (from my gleanings of this thread and the MT one), you're rocking between 400 and 600 spell damage.  Lets take 600 (SoR scales better than SoV so the results will be even more in favor of SoV if you assume 400).  Using the (corrected) data from Fiola's post:<br>
<br>
SoV: 5.667%*600 + 50 + 4.3%*600 + 60 = 170dps<br>
SoR: 9%*600 + 30 + 7.3%*600 + 17 = 145dps<br>
<br>
or 25 more dps using SoV (38 if at the 400 spell damage mark).  Now throw away the first 30 seconds of the fight for SoV for arguments sake, and give SoR a 4350 damage lead.  4350 / 25 dps = 174 seconds till they are even, or slightly under 3 minutes.  So 3 1/2 minutes into your fight you're break even.  On an 8 minute fight, that leaves 4 1/2 minutes of fighting with 25 higher dps.  On a fight like VR, 25 more dps at a lower mana cost (according to WoWWiki, at work and can't check the actual values at the moment) isn't something to be sneezed at.<br>
<br>
(Note: Thelyna, I just checked your armory and noticed you're holy spec and therefore don't have the precision or combat expertise talents.  Grabbing these would probably drastically drop your resists, and you might find more favorable results using SoV).</div>

</div>I assure you, Thel's not normally holy- I suspect he was doing arenas or some such, and normally runs with a standard tanking build.<br>
<br>
Even with 5% total spellhit and a 2.0 weapon, all of my math seems to indicate that SoV is quite likely to fall over an 8 minute period, and SoV falling is pretty huge.  A parry, miss or dodge obviously can't proc it, and most 73s have nontrivial avoidance (not to mention the horrible 17% hit mechanic).  Over fights it seems like it's going to constantly be in danger of falling, not to mention a KB even on VR will drop off 2 swings, bringing the likelyhood-of-falling way too high into the fuckup range for me to like it.<br>
<br>
However, my primary issue with SoV isn't that it seems to be worse in every real world case, it's that it is simply not reliable.  I have no desire, whatsoever, to play with dice any more than I have to, and a part of my soul recoils at the thought of taking one of my highest threat abilities and rolling the dice to see if it even works.  Cons can't be resisted beyond the first tick, SoR cannot be resisted (and a JOR resist isn't punishing), Avenger's Shield can be hitcapped, and while HS can be resisted (and wow does that suck) there's not much I can do about it.  Sacrificing one of my best selling points- immense lead threat- for a minor potential advantage and a huge potential drawback, I can't see why I'd go for it.<br>
<br>
I do use it on Leo (I tank fire) since I have close to a minute to build a full stack (with  15% spellhit, by the way, and it's STILL not reliable), so I can judge, swap to SoR shield toss and excorcism (not in that order), followed by Cons and the standard threat rotations, with a +dam trinket and Avenging Wrath (depending on his HP) waiting in the wings in case I get a resist.  I tried for months to use it successfully on VR, but got such erratic results even with fairly hefty melee and spell hit that I dropped it off my spellbook entirely with a happy heart (and coincidentally, got my first single tank VR like two weeks later).<br>
<br>
But hey, if you've found it working so well for you, okay.  I do wish that people would stop proclaiming it as our primary threat seal- it isn't, even if it may have nitche values for certain static fights, SoR should be the seal you use until you know the fight well enough to experiment.  SoV has a host of issues and nontrivial randomness, and a lot of newer tanks see these people claiming SoV is great, go to try to use it  on  something like HAS or FLK (if you kite) and get eaten on threat gen.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I did a few quick tests.<br>
<br>
I bodypull Timber Worg near Shattrah, turn my back to him, then push Seal of Righteous until oom every global cooldown (~25 seals in total). Fire mage uses rank 1 frostbolts, and does around ~4k damage before drawing aggro.<br>
4000 / ( 1.3 [ranged aggro] * 25 [number of seals] ) = ~120 threat<br>

It looks like sealing R9 SoR generates around 110-130 threat... either that or mana loss generates threat too.</div>

</div>I apologize for dredging this post up from page 5, but after reading most of the thread I didn't see more on this subject which I found to be quite interesting.<br>
<br>
I'm a fairly new pally tank just starting in Kara after doing tons of 5-mans, and in fights where I'm taking a ton of damage and therefore getting plenty of mana from heals, I find that there is plenty of time where I'm not doing anything between the cooldowns of Judgement, HS and Consecration.  <br>
<br>
Does anyone make a habit of casting SoR in between cooldowns, in fights where mana is not a concern?  It seems like it could be a very nice boost to threat.<br>
<br>
I would also wonder if the above test was done with RF on.  Since the tooltip says "Increases the threat generated by all Holy spells" it certainly seems like it would affect casting SoR, even though it doesn't do any damage.</div>

Consider the following example, which I was able to replicate dozens of times:<br>

Pack of 3 mobs in Shadow Labs. Warrior tank shoots skull. All 3 mobs make a beeline for him. I notice the Salvation on the Rogue is about to run out so I rebuff him. Star and X marks start running towards me. This also extends to a Warlock placing a non-damage debuff (e.g. Curse of Weakness) getting aggro from a mob.<br>

One usual tanking weapon (I have the S2 Arena Hammer, 1,6 speed, 265 Spelldamage with enchant) and as the second the lower city hammer (2,7 speed, 199 Spelldamage with enchant) as a emergency weapon if you have no proc and 5-7 sek left on your stacks.<br>

</div>That sounds like a lot of bother for minimal benefits.   <br>
<br>
SoV uses the +dmg of the first application, so you could start the stack with the S2 hammer and then switch to LC and build up the SoV more reliably.   But while you gain reliability, you're also losing overall DPS with the lower +dmg on the LC weapon.  <br>
<br>
<br>
Pity that there are so few slow +dmg weapons for T4+.    PPM seal mechanics need a review.</div>

Anyone who is/was on the PTR notice if the SoV mechanics got changed in a similar manner? IE, will judging and resealing SoV cause the ticks to change to the new SoV damage? This has implications for people who like to, for example, pop +spell damage trinkets &amp; Avenging Wrath in order to build up an SoV stack to maintain throughout the fight.</div>

</div>But here's the thing...  It's not a small advantage in threat.  If you can keep the stack active, it's actually a large advantage over SoR, <i>especially</i> for newer tanks that are packing under 200 spelldamage.  The biggest difference between the two seals lies in the judgements, not the "on swing" effects, and the base value of JoV starts out nearly 3x what JoR does.  At lower levels of spelldamage like this, you can actually afford to have your SoV stack drop off once a minute or so, and still have better long-term performance over SoR in certain cases.  The best piece of advice I can give a starting tank for making use of SoV is to get all 3 points in Precision, and get Reckoning over 1h spec.  Those two things will greatly increase the viability of SoV and reduce the chance of threat plateaus from losing the stack too often.  As your gear gets better and you're able to add more spelldamage, melee hit, and spell hit while maintaining high levels of survivability, you can start to fine tune your spec and gear selection to fit the needs of the content you face.<br>
<br>
SoV isn't "the" threat seal, and neither is SoR.  They're both situational, and it's up to every tank to know when to use which one.  I can only assume the same holds true for Horde and SoB.</div>

</div>Not really. SoB isn't situational for tanking at all except as a way to guarantee getting aggro on a mob immediately (since it doesn't miss or resist). It underperforms SoR in all cases save when you have a traditional tanking weapon, and even then it only takes about 200 spelldamage to be worse. The best normal situation you can use it is for offtanking, where you can generate a fair amount of threat with it and a warrior tanking weapon and get heals for mana regen. Even then, it's not all that great. <br>
<br>
SoB has a use: it is better than SoC for ret.</div>

		<div id="post_message_592342">Your ZA method is interesting and quite different from mine. My method tends to play to our strength. You'll notice a trend where all trash pulls are done AOE-Style.<br>
<br>
On Eagle:<br>
-Trash: I tank everything but the windwalker, using ranged taunt to pick up the warrior adds. The reason is we have melee nuke the windwalker and aoe everything else. If a windwalker is dead, we go pull the next group.<br>
-boss: I tank the boss, and the Off-tank (Fury warrior, prot warrior, or Feral Druid) does more damage. The reason is purely for timers.<br>
<br>
On Bear:<br>
-Trash: Standard aoe tanking. Mounted bears are obviously tanked apart.<br>
-Boss: I pick up the bear phase, usually. My effective health is often higher than anyone else's, and I find I generate more threat in this phase. What that boils down to, is when a warrior/druid taunts he has more threat for his phase (allowing more DPS).<br>
<br>
On Lynx:<br>
-Trash: AOE everything. Melee on Tamers.<br>
-Boss: I tank Lynx phase. He is a dual-wielder so Holy Shield charges are used often for more threat. Sometimes, I also duo-tank the Spirit of the Lynx with the boss. If you Avenger's Shield at the transition, you can pick up the Spirit easily (with a judge for good measure). In Split-Phase I judge totems and we DPS down the troll form so Consecrate holds the Spirit easily. <br>
--There is a 'diamond' pattern on the ground that is conveniently far enough for the rocket launcher or misdirect to hit without aggroing the boss. This makes stacking extremely easy without any risk of no-split due to lag or error.<br>
--I highly recommend, if possible, the off-tank use two on-use evasion trinkets such as the Pocketwatch and SSC defense trinket. He can expect to, reliably, get hit for 8-9k and I've seen those trinkets make the boss laughable. I, personally, use DMC:V and the Goblin Rocket Launcher (without a Hunter) or Gnome-Regan Auto-Blocker for him. The Saber Lash is, ironically, not the deadliest part of the fight so much as surviving long enough for a big heal to land on you.<br>
<br>
On Dragonhawk:<br>
-Trash: AOE tank everything. Nuke order Scout &gt; Flame Caster &gt; guardians or Tamer &gt; Hawks. Druid roots is very helpful as is Rocket Launcher stun.<br>
--If you have a paladin healer or shamans, I advise Fire resistance totem/aura in the group you are NOT in, since you can cover this. The reasoning is, one Flame Caster can be stun locked. Two... you have to take a few hits regardless.<br>
-Boss: <br>
With a protection/feral Off-Tank: He tanks Boss, AOE sides. If the group doesn't have much true AOE (mage/warlock) then I use a 4/4/35 method where you do 4 spawns, 4 spawns, then spawn everything on the other side.<br>
With a fury off-tank: Allow 3 spawns on each sides, 3 times, and have all melee handle them. Healers run through my consecrate and I cleanse myself. Yes, it's entirely possible to tank the boss and some adds before Enrage.<br>
<br>
On Hexx Lord:<br>
Really depends on the party. I tank the Hexx Lord himself, and the group burns through the adds. He does not 'empower' before 80% HP, so there's really no reason to rush the fight and die to bad CC timing. If you have a good healing mace/shield, it would be a lot more effective to probably just tank the adds then off-heal. Remember, you only have to 'tank' 1-2 mobs, usually. The snake and Demon are pretty untankable. Everything can be stunned.<br>
--It's advised to keep Aimed Shot or Mortal Strike up as much as possible for the Paladin phase if you lack non-melee counterspells. He will generally heal after a consecrate, which is deadly to any melee, and could spell a wipe.<br>
<br>
On Zul'jin:<br>
We make excellent tanks for Zul'jin. <br>
Phase 1: a joke.<br>
Phase 2: We have a high effective HP, and we can self-cleanse paralysis. I use Devotion Aura here, too.<br>
Phase 3: Equip-macro to Healing shield/mace, find somewhere nice and off-heal. Anything helps.<br>
Phase 4: Let a paladin healer, if possible, take the first BoP for more threat time. Judge wisdom and misdirect if possible.<br>
Phase 5: Swap to fire resist aura, chug a Magic Resistance Potion, pay your party doesn't stand in Fire Pillars.</div>

</div>I dont get this. He does like 1.2 k damage each spell you cast, which usually makes only casting high ranked Holy Light a 'netto gain' in hp. <br>

</div>Without such a swap, in my pure tanking gear, I heal for 2500-3500. I take 1250 (or less on partial) and I have the highest HP in the raid. Why on earth would you NOT heal in this phase when you can get a positive return, and a lot of your mana will be returned from Tornado/cast damage? Even if the net gain was 0, you're transfering damage from someone with 8000-11000 HP to you, with 20,000 HP and is going to get focus-healed by your healers in the transition, anyway.<br>
<br>
I suppose I should note we use nature resistance totem or hunter nature resistance for the healing group since the cast damage can be mitigated.</div>

		<div id="post_message_594598">If the other tank is a prot warrior, well then thats really just too much prot. The second tank imo should be a feral druid or a hybrid warrior. If it did come down to a prot war vs prot pally than it really depends on the fight. I really don't think it matters on eagle or Hex Lord (Lynx does need 2 tanks), but I think the prot warrior is the better choice for Zul'jin, gear being equal and all. Extra healing in p3 and p4 to me is a good thing, better than having a gimped prot dps in there.</div>

</div>It really comes down to where your group is at in terms of progression through the zone.  If you're struggling to get bosses down, then the added healing can be extremely helpful, functioning as a cushion until everyone is comfortable with the encounters.  On the other hand, when you're going for successive timers you need every drop of damage you can get.<br>
<br>
Regarding prot warrior plus prot pally, I've seen some prot warriors crank out some disgustingly high DPS given their spec.  There's nothing wrong with letting them chop away on a given fight if healing is under control.</div>

</div>If one thing I"m learning about posting here is that everyone needs to completely clarify every comment otherwise people look for a reason to disagree.<br>
<br>
My original ZA tanking post was meant for people newly entering ZA without Tier 5 gear or higher. If you're full clearing ZA then you don't need anyone's advice on how to tank it. You obviously have it handled. However If you're just entering the zone for the first time and wondering how you should start attempting these fights, YOU WILL NOT BE DOING TIMED EVENT and thusly the added healing will be far more beneficial to defeating a boss then more DPS. <br>
<br>
You can disagree with me all you want if you have SSC and TK and above on full clear, because my post isn't meant for you. <br>
<br>
But telling people newly entering ZA to rely on DPS instead of Healing when given a "what should the off-tank do". You're crazy if you think DPS is more important.</div>

		<div id="post_message_598295">Arakai - first of all, a few points to consider.<br>
<br>
(1) If dps starts too soon that's their own fault, not yours.<br>
<br>
(2) If a dps pulls agro and gets a BoP the BoP *temporarily* reduces their threat to zero, and you'll not be able to gain their threat lead from your taunt.  BoP to save them *only* if your taunt is resisted or the mob is immune, because once BoP expires their threat on the mob will be restored/reactivated.  Casters that get a BoP or taunt need to learn to stop dps while you regain a safe threat lead.<br>
<br>
That said, you're armoury shows some pretty questionable gear/gem/enchant choices; your tanking weapon is, shall we say,  sub optimal.

</div>Wouldn't suprise me - I was using <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32964"><span><span class="purplename">[Merciless Gladiator's Salvation]</span></span></a> with +81 healing enchant as tanking weapon for a while. It had total of 168 spell damage, which was slightly better then for example Continuum Blade with +40 spell damage.<br>
<br>
After upgrading to <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32450"><span><span class="purplename">[Gladiator's Gavel]</span></span></a> with +40 spell damage I ceased to do that of course, but point is that certain healing items might at some point be marginally better then spell damage weapons - especially considering that there is a good chance damage ones will be highly contested drops.</div>

<br>
- Hammer of the Unearthed Secrets is a good SoVengance Weapon and can be bought on exalted lower City <br>
- Sword of the Archmage the same for SoR and exalted honor hold<br>
<br>
Best would be the PvP Hammer. 12 hours of PvP? Maybe 15? That is one PvP Weekend and you have a very nice starting weapon. 100% sure and no drop luck.</div>

</div>If you're playing on a super-casual "we just want to do 10 matches each week and get our welfare epics team" then you can do that fine in your tanking spec.  I didn't respec when I did arenas and it was no big problem.  Just don't expect to go over 1500 (~350 points/week) if your team does this.<br>
<br>
If your team is semi-serious and you want to actually climb the ladder and get more points, you'd better respec.<br>
<br>
EDIT:  I should note that at the level I'm talking about, a lot of people will assume you're holy as long as you're not wearing a two-hander and you don't give them reason to think otherwise.  So they may very well decide to focus fire on you anyway, and it can actually be a lot of fun "tanking" in PvP, so long as your team has another healer.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Arakai - first of all, a few points to consider.<br>
<br>
(1) If dps starts too soon that's their own fault, not yours.<br>
<br>
(2) If a dps pulls agro and gets a BoP the BoP *temporarily* reduces their threat to zero, and you'll not be able to gain their threat lead from your taunt.  BoP to save them *only* if your taunt is resisted or the mob is immune, because once BoP expires their threat on the mob will be restored/reactivated.  Casters that get a BoP or taunt need to learn to stop dps while you regain a safe threat lead.<br>
<br>
That said, you're armoury shows some pretty questionable gear/gem/enchant choices; your tanking weapon is, shall we say,  sub optimal.  I would suggest you reenchant your Light's Justice for healing and consign it to your healing set, and go back to either the KoT rep sword, or your Crystalforged Sword until you can either finish the grind to exulted with Lower City, and get their spell damage mace, or arena/honour grind for the Gladiator mace.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div><br>
Braque - thank you very much for the input. Can you tell me (other than the weapon) what gear/gems/enchants are questionable? I'm new to this and want to be a solid tank so any pointers you can give me would be appreciated. I understand Lights is primarily a healer mace, it has lower stam (bad) but has higher spell damage so why is it a bad choice relative to the 2 blues I have? I've already got plans for this weekend to get the LC rep hammer but I'm trying to understand the logic so I don't make stupid mistakes again.<br>
<br>
As for BoP I tend to ONLY use that to save a priest or mage's life and not as a regular taunt.<br>
<br>
Thanks</div>

</div>I'm making a guess here that you're not MTing, either that or you made an extremely compelling case why you should get <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28771"><span><span class="purplename">[Light's Justice]</span></span></a> over a healing class( In which case my outstanding tip would be not to piss off the healers, they gotta luuuuuvvvv you).<br>
<br>
In that case, don't stress at your gear level about getting to uncrushable.  For the vast majority of stuff you're going to be called on to tank, it really won't be make or break if you take 1.5 hits every once in a while.  Frankly, due to silences, stuns and, if you're me, occasional lapses in cooldown management, you're going to take the crushing blow here or there anyway.  Your goal should therefore be to make it so you can take said blow without being insta-gibbed.  Uncrushable will come with time( I feel that this is somewhat controversial advice of mine, so take it as you will.  Additionally, if you're MT, you have to be uncrushable, so disregard everything earlier).<br>
<br>
To that end, I'd replace all the +8 dodge gems with +12 stamina.  Dodge is an expensive stat, and stamina will probably serve you better.  Also, pay for the good gems, it's worth it.  You've got a coupla hundred hp lower than were you to use +12's instead of your plus 9s.  The defense is more tricky, because it is absolutely crucial that you keep that above 490 and you're not too far above it.  I would switch out as many gems as possible till you're around 491 or so.  Again, I'd say stack stamina.  Your helm is socketed to get the strength bonus, which is fairly useless.<br>
<br>
I wouldn't use <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28771"><span><span class="purplename">[Light's Justice]</span></span></a>.  You only gain 7 spell damage over the <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32660"><span><span class="bluename">[Crystalforged Sword]</span></span></a> and lose 14 stamina and some cheap block rating (which would push you back toward uncrushable - block rating is easily the "cheapest" stat out there to get to uncrushable).  It's just not really worth it, at least in my opinion.<br>
<br>
Anyway, those would be my suggestions.  The badge gear will put you ahead of where I was at that level, so there's no reason you can't be successful.  The cloak and bracers are good pickups too, when you can get the badges.</div>

<br>
Ok thanks for the advice, I'll get +40 on my crystalforge sword and get the last 7k of rep for LC. I'm hoping to get the helm off the prince one of these days as I don't really think the stalwart defender is a very good piece of gear. I have 1/2 the cards for the furies deck and I'm hoping to complete that at some point as well.<br>

		<div id="post_message_601403">bowbaq, I did some calculations a while back on another site and from what I remember, assuming you're using a good damage weapon (sun eater was the example) it'd take 170 spelldamage before you outpaced it with a spelldamage weapon. And that's on a single target; if you do any add-tanking seal of blood/AP is far worse since you aren't getting as much damage from consecrates. <br>
<br>
Let's see. For AP equivalence:<br>
1 STR = 2 AP<br>
14 AP = 1 damage<br>
<br>
For SoB, you get 30% of your damage as holy damage. The judgment scales with spelldamage, btw (another reason spelldamage is better: it improves SoR and JoR). So let's take the same base damage weapon:<br>
base: 41.5 DPS<br>
<br>
For SoB, each 14 points of AP is (1 + .3*1.9) threat, which is 1.57 TPS per 14 AP. <br>
For SoR, each spelldamage is .5 TPS roughly. Thus you need about 3 spelldamage for the equivalent value of 14 AP. That's rough, but it's going to be close to this - so you can see how badly SoB scales for threat.<br>
<br>
SoB is probably not a bad choice if you've got something like sun eater, don't have the spelldamage and are starting out - but it quickly becomes poor as you get better gear.</div>

</div>This has always been an issue. <br>
<br>
I think that they are specially scripted to ignore many types of incidental damage, and probably periodic damage.  This would make sense, since otherwise they would aggro on healers, or anyone casting an AoE, or a number of variable generic threat sources that would stop them from merely running towards and meleeing Akama.  I figure they are just not responsive to the threat from consecration because of the style of damage it is, whether it is just because they ignore consecration or whether they ignore all holy damage I'm not sure. <br>
<br>
Have you been able to keep aggro on them through SoR/JoR at all? I've never tried.  I have just known that it didn't work for us, so I took a side.  I like handling the sides better anyways because the mobs come out 3 at a time, which is perfect for Avenger's Shield.</div>

</div>How do you do that?  <br>
<br>
Switch Libram -&gt; GCD<br>
Judgement 1.5 seconds later.<br>
SoR Cast -&gt; GCD for 1.5 seconds <br>
Switch Libram -&gt; No additional GCD because of SoR<br>
<br>
Total time elapsed: 3 seconds<br>
Time with Mother Libram Equipped: 1.5 seconds<br>
<br>
If you switch after the judgement, of course you do not get the benefit of the libram.  To me it is not worth triggering the extra GCD before the judgement.  The heroic libram is of no use anyways once you have enough avoidance to push off crushes without it.  And by the time you're at mother I would expect you would likely be well past that point. <br>
<br>

</div>I believe the general idea is that even if Seal of Blood did decent amounts of threat if you gear yourself towards AP/STR, everything else is going to suffer from your lack of spell damage. Your Consecrates and Holy Shields are both reliant on spell damage, and wearing Warrior-esque gear will cause your mana pool to tank (pun intended).<br>
<br>
That being said, Judgement of Blood is very situationally useful. From the Retribution thread, it was concluded that JoB can never get a full resist, so if you ever need to snap aggro on a target, JoB will always come through.<br>

I have my judgement spell macro'd to cast seal of righteousness afterwards so the global cooldown is being used up anyway.

What do we know about Blessing of Sanctuary? Specifically:<br>
1. Does the damage reduction apply to every hit, or on every block?<br>
2. What's the minimum damage required to get the full 80 damage reduction on a hit? I know there's some sort of multiplier at work.<br>

What are our gem recommendations for red and yellow sockets?</div>

Have you been able to keep aggro on them through SoR/JoR at all? I've never tried.  I have just known that it didn't work for us, so I took a side.  I like handling the sides better anyways because the mobs come out 3 at a time, which is perfect for Avenger's Shield.</div>

</div>The instant holy damage occurs if SoV procs when the stack is full.  A proc also refreshes the stack, but that's independent of the damage it does (i.e., procs with a full stack refreshed the debuff even before the extra damage was patched in.)<br>
<br>
IMO, a good tweak for SoV would be to have <i>all</i> melee hits refresh the debuff duration while the seal is active (so, e.g., if you switch to SoR the debuff will tick away unless you switch back to SoV and hit the target.)</div>

</div>1) Depends on your gear level.  Warriors pull ahead at the very high end for single-target tanking, but paladin threat is plenty good until your DPS is very well-geared, and even then it's solid.<br>
<br>
2) Sorry, horde.<br>
<br>
3) The length of the fight doesn't have a whole lot to do with paladin mana longevity.  It's all about the damage we're taking-- either you're taking enough damage to sustain a max threat rotation, or you're taking less damage than that and you have to downrank.  Unlike rage-based tanks, paladins "store" more than 100 rage worth of juice and have the ability to go into a full threat rotation from the start, but without incoming damage being healed up a paladin can only maintain a max threat rotation for perhaps 45 seconds.  Nobody ever accused a non-holy paladin of being mana-efficient.<br>
<br>
So I guess the answer to that last question is more that there are fights on which your mana is a concern, and there are fights on which your mana isn't a concern, and the fights where it's a problem are roughly the same fights during which warriors will be rage-starved regularly.</div>

</div>1) I see responses that we're "not as good", but I feel that's oversimplifying the situation.  In theory there is a way to match paladin TPS to warrior/druid TPS, given different combinations of abilities and gearsets.  For instance, there is a value of spelldamage available for a paladin to attain using HS/Cons/JoR/SoR that would match a warrior using SS/Revenge/Devastate/Devastate.  The calculations would be pretty obscene because everything that affects threat for both classes needs to be taken into account (avoidance, expertise, crit%, etc.), but there is no question that it can be done.<br>
<br>
2) I mentioned this a few pages back (EDIT: <a href="#post574299" target="_blank">here</a>), but ultimately it's not worthwhile because the risk of losing the SoV stack is too high.  However, this tactic is situationally useful on fights with threat drops so that you can burst threat and allow your DPS to unload.  I use this on Leo when he switches from demon to elf, and our DPS literally stops for about 2 seconds before cranking it out again.<br>
<br>
3) Already mentioned, but mana issues are directly tied to your incoming damage, which is directly tied to your level of gear.  Right now, the Lynx boss in ZA provides me infinite mana because he hits so hard, but I know there is a gearset that exists where I'd need to pay attention to my mana usage.  It's too situational to directly nail down, but have mana pots at the ready in case you need them (and ironshield pots for the bosses that keep your blue bar full).</div>

</div>I disagree; while you can theorycraft at what point a paladin can match a warrior, the reality is that warriors do more single target TPS than a paladin at equivalent gear for good enough rotations. In some gimmick fights that might not be true (Prince is a good example: fast-hitting bosses that also can be exorcised are paladin gravy) but it certainly is true in the general case and is very true as you're hitting T6 content. At the highest levels, the problem with paladin gear is that you cannot go as threat-heavy as a warrior can without sacrificing too much in the way of defensive stats.<br>
<br>
Can't say how well a druid's threat scales by comparison. I would imagine it's about the same as a paladin for about the same reasons; itemization for non-warrior tanks has consistently sucked.<br>
<br>
2: horde as well. Heard good reports on SoV/SoR interweaving but I've also heard it's unreliable.<br>
3: mana isn't an issue while we're being healed. As long as the damage being taken is high the mana received is high. Still have to pot now and then though.</div>

</div>It's usually just as good to unequip and reequip your shield. SoR/JoR account for a very good amount of your threat, and SoB with SD gear isn't going to compare. Really, if you're not taking enough damage you can likely just drop holy shield instead. <br>
<br>
SoB is not a bad choice at all for off-tanking since you won't be getting hit as much, but there are other options to lose health that are a bit more efficient than using SoB.</div>

I have some questions myself:<br>

What do we know about Blessing of Sanctuary? Specifically:<br>
1. Does the damage reduction apply to every hit, or on every block?<br>
2. What's the minimum damage required to get the full 80 damage reduction on a hit? I know there's some sort of multiplier at work.<br></div>

		<!-- message -->
		<div id="post_message_603323"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I only started tanking as a Paladin ~2-3 weeks ago, and it's been a major shift for me.  As my guild progressed in to hyjal/bt, there were many comments about wanting a paladin tank.  i've read through many of the posts on the forums, to guide my spec, to guide my gear and such, and first of all want to say a huge 'thank you' to those who put their time and effort in to these posts, as they have made me not look like a complete noob as I switch from single-macro-pressing-BM-hunter to wow-i-have-to-pay-attention-to-stuff-tank.<br>
<br>
As you can see from my profile, I have some pretty random gear right now.  I am not a MT - our raid and guild leader is a warrior tank, and he's absolutely amazing at it.  I'm here for fights with offtanks needed, hyjal trash, judgements on bosses while off-healing...that kind of thing.  So I focused mainly on hitting defense cap, getting a good amount of stamina, and then going balls-out on spell damage so that I can hold aggro quicker.  <br>
<br>
But there has been something that has been bugging me.  Currently, my aoe-tank trinkets are <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=31858" target="_blank">[Darkmoon Card: Vengeance]</a> and <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30447" target="_blank">[Tome of Fiery Redemption]</a>.  One has a large amount of stamina, a frequently-proccing holy damage trinket and the other a frequent high-damage boost to my consecrations.  <br>
<br>
So, here are my questions.  <br>
<br>
1: I have browsed wowhead for better "aoe" tanking trinkets and really havn't found any than the ones I already have.  Does anyone suggest a different trinket of this type to replace mine?<br>
<br>
2: I am currently having problems with big-hits by abominations from hyjal trash and certain naga/orcs from BT trash.  Is this a problem due to main gear, or should I switch out my Tome for a more conventional tanking trinket.  If I do this, which one would you suggest?<br>
<br>
3: Specs have been bothering me.  These three specs in particular have been bouncing forth in my mind - What do you think? <br>
<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080419050936/http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/classes/paladin/talents.html?0000000000000000000005305033500001320215515500500000200000000000" target="_blank">First</a>  <br>
Improved might - buffs melee/hunter dps.  Ret aura, increases my threat gen (I have the ability to go 2/5 t5 if I choose to with this spec)<br>
<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080419050936/http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/classes/paladin/talents.html?0000000000000000000005305133500021520215510500500020000000000000" target="_blank">Second</a><br>
From what I understand, the "standard" tanking spec for this type of thing.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080419050936/http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/classes/paladin/talents.html?0000000000000000000005305033500001320215510503500020200000000000" target="_blank">Third</a><br>
Improved Seal of the Crusader (3% raid crit, more holy damage for me). Ret aura, increased threat gen (2/5 t5).  Con is that if I have 3% raid crit up, casters lose JoW.<br>
<br>
Sorry for the lengthy post...as I learn more about my new class and do different things with it, I'll be glad to share my knowledge as well <!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Note though, that it works against all sources, which makes it fully effective against magic attacks (I would think, I have no proof for this).  Plus, 40-odd holy damage added to blocks never hurt a prot pally <!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Those two trinkets are already a very good choice. The only Item which i can think of which may replace the Tome might be <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34579" target="_blank">Battlemaster's Audacity - WoWHead</a> to have your own "Mini-Last-Stand" and constant + bonus damage instead of a proc.<br>

</div>Hard to give a good advice because it depends partly on your raid make up. You have constantly a Retribution Paladin? Then dont bother with Improved SotC. Your specs in general all traded One handed Weapon Specialization for Reckoning. Its quite a difference as shown in this Thread but One Handed is at least for AE Tanking Superior (since it affects everything: Judgements, Consecrates, Exorcism, Holy Wrath etc). Else most of the Talents (Spell warding i.e.) are just Personal Preference.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_603355"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Wow, I feel like a complete and total newb as I actually *read* the one-handed spec wording.  I always read it similiar to the warrior 2-handed spec, IE increasing damage done with the weapon.  Time to go throw down 50g for a respec.  And no, we don't bring ret paladins.  General raid makeup is as follows<br>
<br>
Group 1: 2-3 Warrior tanks, druid tank, druid healer, paladin if only 2 tanks<br>
Group 2: rogue/rogue/rogue/fury warrior/enhancment shaman<br>
Group 3: mage/mage/mage/warlock/ele shaman<br>
Group 4: healer/healer/healer/healer/shadowpriest<br>
Group 5: Random DPS/healers (usually something like holydin/warlock/warlock/hunter/hunter - I know it sucks, but talk to the raid leader not me)<br>
<br>
3% crit is being begged for by our melee dps and mages, but warlocks/spriests/hunters still want Judgement of Wisdom.<br>

While trash tanking, Blessing of Sanctuary is quite useful.<br>
<br>
Ghouls during Kaz'rogal trash hit for about 2200 before armor reduction, so 2200 * 40% = 880 .  2200-80 = 2120 * 40% = 848.  So, 32 damage less each hit with 6 mobs on me stacks up.  In addition, the block damage (~42-43 with my spell damage) is affected by Righteous fury, and I'm not sure about other tanks, but I block a lot.

		<div id="post_message_603426"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'd suggest to add general situational gearing tips and what to consider.<br>
<br>
Groups of tanking tasks:<br>
- Hardhitter<br>
- Fasthitter<br>
- Group tanking<br>
- tauntable Mobs<br>
- casters<br>
- weak hitting single targets<br>
<br>
The points to keep in mind:<br>
- Block rating vs. avoidance (esp. looking at threat since avoidance is inversely propotional to our threat)<br>
- the value of block rating (concerning EH)<br>
- The need of avoidance, which is strongly depending on your EH in relation to the mob's attack speed and base damage<br>
- the value of meleehit<br>
<br>
<br>
Concerning SoV: I'm working on maths for the seal and one thing is for sure: without spellhit the variety of possible TPS patterns becomes too wide (spellresistchance comes up multiple times). You need to have a slow weapon and as much spellhit as possible for this seal. If you have these, it is far superior to SoR until very high amounts of spelldmg.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Right, not saying it's not.  But you have to be bringing at least 4 pallies before it'll be useful.  Light and Kings are obviously heaps more important than Sanct.  And the likelihood is you'll have a holy pally with imp wisdom that will want to be rockin' that.  So unless you're comfortable constantly buffing 10 minute buffs, and having some semi-complicated scheme like you bless Kings on the pallies and 10-min sanct on yourself, and a imp-wis pally blessing wisdom on the pallies and 10-min kings on you.

				<div style="font-style:italic">Right, not saying it's not.  But you have to be bringing at least 4 pallies before it'll be useful.  Light and Kings are obviously heaps more important than Sanct.

So unless you're comfortable constantly buffing 10 minute buffs, and having some semi-complicated scheme like you bless Kings on the pallies and 10-min sanct on yourself, and a imp-wis pally blessing wisdom on the pallies and 10-min kings on you.

</div>Salvation?  On paladins?  This is because of a ret pally, or for the healers?  If it's for the healers, then I'd really take another look at that. (Paladin without Salv does .25 threat/heal.  Priest/Druid/Shammy with salv does .35 threat/heal.  So your paladins have to be healing 1.4 times what your other healers are healing in order to get even on the threat.  Which in my raids is still <b>far</b> below that of the tanks and dps).  If it's for the ret pally, he should keep 10-minute salvs active on himself, as it will only benefit him out of all the pallies, and he can give everyone else a more useful buff( unless you have 6 pallies in the raid, in which case everyone gets pretty much everything ).<br>
<br>
If you have paladins healing you, you should always have Blessing of Light up.<br>
1 pally (you): Kings<br>
2 pallies( you + healer): Kings and Light(Have holy pally keep wisdom up on himself)<br>
2 pallies( you + ret ): Kings + Sanct/Might/Wis(depending on if ret has kings)<br>
3 pallies( you + 2 healers): Kings, Light and Wisdom(Sanct if you use the semi-complicated scheme discussed in my previous post)<br>
3 pallies( you + ret + holy): Kings, Light and Wisdom(Sanct...).  Have ret pally bless light and take care of his own salvation.<br>

</div>Most healers generate .5 threat per 1 pt healed.  Paladins are actually at .25 threat per point.  The .35 was .7(salv) applied to the base .5.<br>
<br>
I don't have any hard data to support this, but to the best of my knowledge it's been an accepted fact that paladins gain half as much threat/heal than normal.  See: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080419050936/http://elitistjerks.com/f15/t11319-morogrim_murlocs/p22/" target="_blank">MT and murloc thread</a> which shows others at least with the same belief.<br>
<br>
As for Righteous Fury, it doesn't quite even it out.  Imp RF gives a .9 increase to threat caused by holy spells, so you sit around .475 threat/heal.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Well the thing is, unless your pallies are healing way, way more than your other healing classes, you want them at the top of the threat meter ( as far as healers go ).  That way, if something happens to your tank (daze, intimidating shout, etc), where the mob runs off toward your nearest friendly healer, it's running toward someone with a boat-load of armor( My holy buddy has over 18k armor in full-healing gear, which is only ~1k less than I do).<br>
<br>
I really think that Salvation is pretty much the most useless buff for any non-ret pally of any available.  I think from a safety standpoint, you're actually hurting yourself.  Anecdotally, I'll say that we haven't run with salv( barring 6 or 7 pallies in our raid) from kara through Hyjal (now 4/5 hyj and 1/9 BT), and pallies drawing healing aggro has <b>never</b> been the cause of a wipe.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>It's a bit different for Alliance, due to SoV's mechanics.  When 2.2 hit I tried out a 46/15 spec w/o Reckoning, and losing that 10% chance for extra swings essentially killed my ability to use SoV while tanking.  It didn't take long for me to respec back to pick up 5/5 Reckoning since SoV far outperforms SoR at "normal" levels of spell damage found on tanking gear, provided you can keep the stack active.  For Horde though, I definitely think you're right.<br>
<br>
@Damnathor:<br>
<br>
You seem to have a solid grasp of what to pick up in the Prot tree, but if you're going to spend most of your time tanking I'd suggest a 48/13 or 51/10 spec (depending on if your guild wants you to have Imp SotC).  Forget Pursuit of Justice, and get your boots enchanted with Boar's Speed instead.  The 3% spell avoidance from 3 points in this talent is worse than 2 points for 4% reduced damage taken from Spell Warding.<br>
<br>
And yes, picking up Imp. SotC will actually make it harder to hold aggro since your raid's DPS classes will have spikier threat generation.  Note that if you're not the active tank, this talent can increase the threat generation of your neighboring warrior or druid tanks.  Also, it's not worth getting unless you're going to put all 3 points into it because it will end up competing with JoW for your judgement debuff, which is arguably better than 1-2% extra raid crit.  Keep these things in mind if you're looking to pick up this talent.</div>

</div>I can definitely see dropping reckoning for 25 man raids, but I think I'd really miss it for heroics and 10-mans.  When I have three-four mobs beating on me it has a fairly substantial uptime and allows me to use a lot less mana while tanking.  I can pretty much just keep JoW up and keep up a 5 stack on SoVengeance on two to three mobs.  Without reckoning I'd have to spam consecrate, which really gets the CC pissed off at me.<br>
<br>
While I haven't tanked any 25-mans, I have seen up through Hyjal and all but RoS/Mother/Illidan in BT and do agree the talent doesn't have much of a place in those instances.  But for anything smaller I really like it.</div>

</div>See, there's your problem.  If something is in the range of consecrate, it shouldn't need to be CC'd.  And if it's out of the range of consecrate( pesky casters...), then you don't have to worry about breaking it.  And if you're worried about mana consumption, then you're really just not taking enough damage.<br>
<br>
If you're going to use CC though, have your dps get used to doing it <i>before</i> the mobs get to you.  This is incredibly helpful and shouldn't be that hard to do.  Have them babysit their sheeps/shackles/seduces if necessary.</div>

I am sorry, but SoV killed your ability to use SoV while tanking.  There is oh so very many reasons that SoV is a terrible tanking seal. I am sure they are detailed in either this thread, or here: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302215407/http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t10440-paladin_mtanking_viability_thread/" target="_blank">[Paladin] MTanking viability thread</a> .<br>
<br>
As well, Seal of Righteousness gets far more use out of reckoning than Seal of Vengeance, as it doubles your output while for SoV it only reduces the chance your stack will fall off.  <br>
<br>
Seal of Vengeance has on average a 15 second minimum ramp-up time as well as 16% chance to be resisted, and a 46% chance per hit to not even apply a stack with the weapon you are using. <br>
<br>
The only thing that SoV really is good for is grinding, before you get much spell damage, as a non-ret-spec paladin.<br>
<br>
SoR scales better with spell damage, has no ramp-up time, is more reliable, and allows you to spec out of reckoning if you want to, because you probably will eventually, as with more avoidance, 1h spec starts to give far better returns.</div>

		<div id="post_message_605934">Since holy paladins only need kings and wisdom, and generally don't raid heal, there isn't really a 3rd useful blessing for them. wether you want salv so that missed shield slam + glancing auto or whatever to be enough to pull it off of you, or light so you pallise can heal eachother better is completely negligible, considering how rare both cases should be. I would generally lean towards giving light though. Running imp RF is usually a given on fights where healing aggro is not an issue, but fights with many aggro resets or and/or add spawns not running RF and running with salv probably makes things slightly easier. For example on morogrim pallies with salv can easily keep the tank up and not pull aggro while the prot pally with no salv and righteous fury does his not-very-strong max ran HL and priests/druids can't really heal much at that point. Leo and hydross transitions also play some kind of a role although no as significant considering the amount of slack and/or bad luck your raid needs to have for no salv to mess up an otherwise-smooth transition.<br>
Again, salv VS light as blessing #3 is quite negligible, although running with salv and RF at the same time is kinda rediculess. If you think you will never pull healing aggro but want more threat than the other healers, run RF and light...</div>

</div>So you came to drastically different results reading the same threads on the value of SoV.  I wish people would stop saying that SoV is so terrible when it's soooooooo drastically better than SoR at lower spell damage values (given the not implausible assumption that you can keep the stack up most of the time). <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302215407/http://elitistjerks.com/590113-post581.html" target="_blank">This</a> post sums up the value of SoV nicely I think.</div>

I agree with this. If a healer is going to get healing aggro, it should be Paladins first with their high armor and generally higher health compared to other healers. Especially in Hyjal you really don't want your Paladins to have less threat than a Priest so a stray Abom starts hitting them instead of you. Plate, more health and HoJ (and heck, DS) all offer a Paladin more tools to survive this until a tank is there to pick it up than an AoE scream on immune undead mobs.</div>

<br>
One thing I noticed that I wanted to make mention of is the avoidance macro. <br>
<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px; ">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:0px"><img src="assets/citation.gif" border="0"></div>

		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>I just wanted to question if the +20 in there is for 5/5 anticipation (it appears it is) and if so be sure to replace that with the amount of defense you actually took via those talents (ex. 3/5 points = 12 rather then 20 defense).<br>
<br>
The other thing I wanted to touch base on, which seems to be highly requested, is talent builds. I've gone through several revisions and although none have been "everything" I wanted I have found the current build that I am very happy with. I'll go through the build, why I took certain talents &amp; why I didn't take others as well as some of the other builds that I've had before and how they worked out. <br>
<br>
For starters let me give you a quick bit of background since I'm new here. I've been a Prot pally since we were mid way through Karazhan due to a lack of attendance in Warriors &amp; Druids. I've tanked everything in Karazhan, TK &amp; SSC, Hyjal &amp; BT trash and of course all heroics. The Fabled usually runs with 4 pallys total: 2 Holy, 1 prot, 1 Ret, so there are some talents which I simply don't need because they are covered by the other pallys. For best threat generation I prefer using Retribution aura (improved from the 2 peice Tier 4 set bonus), Windfury totem and if you have a Ret paladin try to get him in your group with Sanctity aura.<br>
<br>
My current build: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302215407/http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/classes/paladin/talents.html?0000000000000000000005320133300001425215510520500030000000000000" target="_blank">0/46/15</a><br>
<br>
<font color="Blue">Prot tree:</font> As you can see there are some talents I've avoided here which some may consider highly useful, and while I would probably agree with that there are only 61 talent points to play with so inevitably somethings are going to be left out. <br>
<br>
<font color="Green">First Tier:</font> Redoubt is a must have. All though it's a proc, it's very beneficial and hits all the time. You shouldnt' pass up a 10% chance to increase your block by 30%. Allot of Holy paladins will get the improved devotion aura when going for kings anyway, so stick them in your group if you feel you really need the armor bonus.<br>
<br>
<font color="Green">Second Tier:</font> Most would say go for 5/5 Toughness and that's certainly a valid statement. However, I found that the spell  &amp; mele hit were much more beneficial to me personally then a bit more armor. 2/2 Guardians favor is honestly just because I could have either gotten this and been able to save someone every 3 minutes instead of 5 (very handy for Bloodboil) and rather then get a measly 4% armor increase I opted for a lower cool down on BOP.<br>
<br>
<font color="Green">Third Tier: </font>YUM!  Kings and 3/3 RF are a MUST. I'd also highly recomend 3/3 shield specialization, as it helps greatly for AE tanking. Anticipation is of course very beneficial, as defense is one of the keys to becoming uncrittable/uncrushable as well as just plain adding more avoidance to your tanking, however at a certain point you'll find your gear will outweigh the need to go a full 5/5 in this. More defense will of course add to your d/p/b which is always a good thing, but IMO once you get past the 500 defense mark (already 10 over the crit/crush mark) it's not worth talent points to add to your defense. Gear will likely cover this with loads of +defense on it already (I'm currently at 509 defense).<br>
<br>
<font color="Green">Fourth Tier:</font> Skip! "Handy" items at best, but as I mentioned before you only have 61 talents and all these can be left out.<br>
<br>
<font color="Green">Fifth Tier:</font> 1/1 Sanctuary of course and 4/5 Reckoning (missing 1 point in reckoning isnt' going to affect the proc rate much, use 5 points total to get to the next tier and save the 1 point for something more beneficial). Both help with threat and you need Sanc anyway to get some very necessary talents later in the tree. <br>
<br>
<font color="Green">Sixth Tier:</font> 2/2 Sacred Duty is a must have, the more stam the better and the Divine Shield benefits are handy. 5/5 weapon specialization is a must have for threat.<br>
<br>
<font color="Green">Seventh Tier:</font> Again, get everything. 5/5 Ardent defender has saved me (and wipes) on countless occasion where those blows would have killed me. 30% damage reduction is something you shouldn't pass up IMO, even if it is only when you're below 35% HP. 1/1 Holy shield and 2/2 improved is a no-brainer. The more you can block, the better, plus the damage increase helps with threat slightly. <br>
<br>
<font color="Green">Eighth Tier:</font> Previously I had skipped this tier completely, but with the 2.3 patch Blizzard added a 10% increase to stam which makes this a must have. 5 expertise is a handy bonus that comes with this but really the stam is the primary reason for getting this talent.<br>
<br>
<font color="Green">Ninth Tier:</font> Of course, avenger's shield. Great for pulling, great for getting multiple mobs attention, awesome for threat.<br>
<br>
<font color="Blue">Ret tree:</font> Here's where I've played around allot figuring out what's best for me &amp; the raid group. With the changes in the 2.3 patch, effectively making Ret pallys viable DPS we recruited for one and thus eliminating the need for me to pick up certain talents that the Ret pally covered.<br>
<br>
<font color="Green">First Tier: </font> 5/5 Benediction is something I simply can't pass up. Although you get mana back from heals, you'll find that once your avoidance is so high you may be taking very little damage in certain fights, thus not getting much in the way of mana returned. Since you can't feasibly go as deep as tier 6 to get the benefits from the 80% mana return from sanctified judgment, Benediction is the next best thing. Improved might is something our Ret pally takes care of, hopefully you have one to take this talent for you. Otherwise, I'd honestly say too bad for your mele unless you can see a way to skip out on 5 points somewhere else.<br>
<br>
<font color="Green">Second Tier:</font> 5/5 Parry is a must have, the more the better. Well worth the 5 points as 5% is a HUGE amount to not have to compensate for with gear or gems. 2/2 Improved judgment will help tremendously with threat. You wouldn't think 2 seconds would be that big of a deal, and honestly if you absolutely have to avoid this talent for something else it wouldn't kill you, but a shorter cool down on one of your highest threat actions will keep mobs on you and gain their attention faster. If you don't have a Ret pally in your raid makeup, 3/3 Improved Seal is also very beneficial to your raid group for the obvious boost in crit to all spells and attacks.<br>
<br>
<font color="Green">Third Tier:</font> If you do have a Ret pally and can spare the 3 points (by not using them in improved Crusader) I'd highly recommend Pursuit of Justice. The run speed boost is nice and will avoid the need for run speed gems or enchants. The best thing about this talent however is the 3% spell avoidance increase. This is one of the newer talents I've played with as Prot and with all the increased resists I'm seeing on incoming spells I'm never not getting this talent.<br>
<br>
So there you have it, my personal opinions on my favorite talent build and why I went with the talents I did. As I mentioned I've played with several different versions of builds and in no way is this set in stone or a pally talent bible, it's just the build I've come to find is most beneficial given my role in raids and raid makeup. <br>
<br>
Here are some other builds I've had and found to be decent for tier 4 &amp; 5 raiding:<br>
<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302215407/http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/classes/paladin/talents.html?0000000000000000000005005133520001525210510523500000000000000000" target="_blank">0/46/15</a> - Similar to my current build though with a few subtle differences including some items you'd pickup if you didn't have a Ret pally in your raid makeup.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302215407/http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/classes/paladin/talents.html?0000000000000000000005302133500001423210510523505000000000000000" target="_blank">0/41/20</a> - This build was really to have a decent amount of defensive abilities and some Ret talents to help when soloing or when only one tank was needed on any given fight. I wouldn't really recommend this build for someone wanting to tank bosses though, as you'll notice several prot talents aren't maxed out, reducing avoidance and threat.</div>

	</tbody></table>
</div>Windfury Totem is for all intents and purposes a 20% increase to your seal threat, and a bit more for white attacks due to the AP boost on the extra swing (Not much, but an additional ~1.3 TPS). The big advantage here lies in the fact that Windfury totem scales with your gear while the other totem options are static bonuses. There's also the factor that if you're in a tank group along with a Warrior Windfury Totem is extremely good for them.<br>
<br>
Superior Wizard oil is 42 spell damage, equaling about 21 TPS (Possibly a bit more, I erred to the low side when calculating the approximate TPS per point of spell damage value).<br>
<br>
If auto-attack plus seal TPS equals at least 17.5, Windfury Totem is better; in other words, on a single target Windfury Totem is pretty much always going to be superior.<br>
<br>
That is of course only on a single target, due to the fact that Consecration scales extremely well with spell damage, Superior Wizard Oil is worth about 9 TPS per target in range, in a heavy AoE situation Superior Wizard Oil is most likely better; also due to the fact that single target aggro is (usually) less of a concern in such situations.<br>
<br>
I'd go into comparisons of Superior Wizard Oil along with another totem compared to Windfury Totem, but generally which totem is dropped is really dependent on what the setup of the rest of your group is.<br>
<br>
I'll also probably finally get around to doing updates to this thread again soon, we've (finally!) killed Illidan now, due to which I have more free time than I'd usually have.</div>

</div>This is correct.  Replace +20 with the actual amount you gain from talents.  This is explained in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302215407/http://www.wowwiki.com/Crushing_blow" target="_blank">wowwiki</a> entry for Crushing Blow.<br>
<br>
The macro assumes that both warriors and paladins have max ranks in their respective +defense talents.<br>
<br>
Out of curiosity, I'll add my own question to this though.  Why doesn't GetCombatRatingBonus's return value include the extra 20 points from our +defense talent?</div>

</div>Excellent point, and I feel it's worth noting that Wrath of Air totem wins for paladin threat generation in almost all cases.  You're looking at another 101 spell damage (121 with T4 bonus) plus another 42 for the oil.  Windfury scales better when just looking at TPS from your seal, but when you take Consecration, Judgements, Holy Shield, etc. into account, Wrath of Air pulls ahead.  As soon as you add multiple mobs into the mix, there's simply no competition.<br>
<br>
FWIW, on our first few Leo attempts I found myself in the caster group as the MT of the elf phase of the fight.  I had an effective 720 spell damage after buffs and JotC, and that was in my survival gear.  This was done for the reasons listed above, plus the ability to utterly obliterate my inner demon when it popped.  Good times.</div>

</div>I believe GetCombatRatingBonus only returns the extra amount of whatever stat (in this case defense) that you get from rating on your gear. You'll notice it also doesn't return the 350 base defense that you have for being level 70.<br>
<br>
Since Anticipation adds straight defense and not defense rating, it isn't included in the return.</div>

</div>I used a combo of healing &amp; tanking gear for this. Healing gear with Righteous Fury to get agro easily and tanking gear for obvious reasons. What seemed to work well for me was a combo of about 800 +healing and enough stam to still get to about 14k hp buffed. Positioning was also a huge factor, finding a good tanking spot outside the range of possibly getting a watery grave where the murlocs could still "see" you on their way in was key for that fight.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">SoR scales better with spell damage, has no ramp-up time, is more reliable, and allows you to spec out of reckoning if you want to, because you probably will eventually, as with more avoidance, 1h spec starts to give far better returns.</div>

</div>If SoR gets more use out of reckoning than SoV why would switching to SoR allow you to drop Reckoning whereas SoV wouldn't?<br>
<br>
Also, I remember reading somewhere (I thought it was in this thread but I couldn't find it) that while SoR scales better than SoV, SoR doesn't out-damage SoV until somewhere above 900 spelldamage.  Just because something scales better doesn't mean it actually is better. <br>
<br>
SoV is situational, but when I can use it effectively I love it.  With Reckoning + Windfury I've seen a 5-stack go up in as little as four seconds.  On mobs where I'm going to be hitting it the entire time I can pop wings on pull, go all out for about 10 seconds, then have enough of a threat lead to temporarily sacrifice some TPS in order to get that 5-stack up.</div>

You're looking at another 101 spell damage (121 with T4 bonus) plus another 42 for the oil.

</div>I'd recommend uncritability in some way, shape or form, and reasonable avoidance (50% or thereabouts, counting blocks for avoidance if they reduce the Murloc melee damage to a negligible amount). When I originally tanked here I had about 13000 health buffed, but this was back when Prot Paladin gear tended to have mana/5 on it and before we had the new Weapon Expertise (Or in other words, expect to have more health if you have the Protection version of tier 4). As I recommended in original post, make sure you have a way of swapping a healing weapon and a spell damage weapon back and forth. These stats may even be slightly over the top; I'm not entirely sure as I've been Prot for my entire Paladin life, and thus already had a good selection of tanking gear by the time we reached Morogrim.<br>
<br>
If you have some PvP healing gear it's quite good for Morogrim now. It'll make it easier to get initial aggro, provides some spell damage to make Consecration and Holy Shield more powerful, and also helps towards becoming uncritable, not to mention it has good stam.<br>
<br>
Uncritability and 50% avoidance should make it so you take low enough damage for any single healer to outheal easily. We usually had a Resto Druid cover my healing with HoTs, with a Shaman assigned to optimally help out if I dropped low for some reason. This was changed to just a Resto Druid when they changed Lifebloom to stack properly. The Resto Druid also at the same time helped out on getting people topped off again after the Murlocs reached me.</div>

</div>Just a note about this... I HIGHLY recommend getting Figurine of the Colossus (Steamvaults heroic I believe). It is ~3.5% block and when popped, heals you for 120 health every time you successfully block. It will be a staple for me for a long time to come. At ~21% block I was regularly getting 3,000 to 3,200 in healing back per activation of the trinket (which is also additional threat). Since I have climbed to 28% block, I haven't directly looked for the total amount, but i imagine it is a fair amount higher. Just remember, pop this right before Holy Shield to make sure that you get those first 8 (960 healing) 100% of the time. It will still be up when Holy Shield CD ends, so pop Holy Shield again for another 960 healing. In any 3+ trash group, that is guaranteed 1,920 healing, the rest of the kickbacks from normal blocks are just icing on the cake, plus the additional threat off of the healing effect, plus the static +3.5% block.<br>
<br>
Granted, if you are getting hit (after block) for more than 120, then it just effectively increases the block value, but unlike the Autoblocker, if you are full blocking, additional effect is not wasted, there is a net gain rather than a constant break-even. Plus Autoblocker popping doesn't generate any threat at all.<br>
<br>
It has no internal cooldown, and there is no limit to it that I have found. I have used it on pulling half the SM Cathedral by aggroing the last boss, and healed 15,000 health in 20 seconds from that trinket alone. (Granted, this is extreme, and against stuff 32 levels lower, but an example on it's capacity).<br>
<br>
It has no use against individual bosses, so I swap that out for the Scarab of Displacement off of Hydross.</div>

	</tbody></table>
</div>Let's get some assumptions out of the way.  I'll be ignoring 1h Weapon Spec, which actually favors using WoA over WF.  The accuracy of the target numbers isn't going to be perfect, and these are simply best guesses from WWS parses.<br>
<br>
Target armor: 4000 (almost exactly 25% reduction)<br>
Target attack speed: 2.0s<br>
Target dodge: 5.6%<br>
Target parry: 11.2%<br>
<br>
Paladin block rate: 50% (works out to 1 block every 4 seconds on average against 2.0s target swing time)<br>
<br>
Paladin weapon DPS: 41.4<br>
Paladin AP: 500 (probably assuming too high, but not going to change much)<br>
Paladin modified DPS = 41.4 + (500 / 14) = 77.1<br>
<br>
Paladin +hit: 3% (precision)<br>
Paladin expertise: 5 (CE)<br>
Base hit % = 100% - 9% (standard missrate) - 5.6% (dodge) - 11.2% (parry) = 74.2%<br>
<br>
Paladin hit % = 74.2 + 3% (hit) + 2.5% (expertise) = 79.7%<br>
Paladin white DPS = 77.1 * (100% - 25% damage reduction) * 79.7% hitrate = 46.1 DPS*<br>
<br>
* Glancing blows reduce this number quite a bit, but I'm not going into the math of that here.  Crits are also ignored due to prot pallies typically having very low (&lt; 5%) crit rates.<br>
<br>
Windfury's TPS increase works out to essentially be 20% of your white damage plus threat added from SoR.  The TPS from SoR can be calculated using the following equation (remember, ignoring 1h weapon spec):<br>
<br>
<i>(Paladin_Spelldmg * SoR_DPS_Coefficient + SoR_Base_DPS) * RF_Threat_Modifier * Paladin_Hit%</i><br>
<br>
The coefficient for SoR is WeaponSpeed * 9.2%, which simplifies to 9.2% per second for the DPS coefficient.  SoR's base DPS is around 26.1.  Using these numbers, we can find how much Windfury adds at given spell damage values.<br>
<br>
WF @200 dmg = 20% * (46.1 + (200 * 9.2% + 26.1) * 190% * 79.7%) = 22.70 TPS<br>
WF @400 dmg = 20% * (46.1 + (400 * 9.2% + 26.1) * 190% * 79.7%) = 28.27 TPS<br>
WF @600 dmg = 20% * (46.1 + (600 * 9.2% + 26.1) * 190% * 79.7%) = 33.84 TPS<br>
WF @800 dmg = 20% * (46.1 + (800 * 9.2% + 26.1) * 190% * 79.7%) = 39.41 TPS<br>
WF @1000 dmg = 20% * (46.1 + (1000 * 9.2% + 26.1) * 190% * 79.7%) = 44.99 TPS<br>
<br>
For Wrath of Air + Wizard Oil (assuming 143 spell damage added from the combo) the math is simpler since it's a flat amount that gets added to your threat.  However, it affects more than just your melee swings.<br>
<br>
WoA boost to SoR = (143 * 9.2%) * 190% * 79.7% = 19.92 TPS<br>
WoA boost to JoR = 143 * 42.9% / 10 = 6.13 TPS (assuming one judgement every 10 seconds)<br>
WoA boost to HS = 143 * 5% * (50% (paladin block rate) / 2.0 (target attack speed)) * (190% + 35% (HS innate threat bonus)) = 4.02 TPS<br>
WoA boost to Cons = 143 * 76% / 10 = 10.87 TPS (again, assuming one cast every 10 seconds)<br>
WoA boost to Exorcism = 143 * 42.9% / 15 = 4.09 TPS<br>
<br>
Looking at realistic scenarios where you're able to use SoR/JoR/HS/Cons against a single boss target, these four things add up to 40.94 TPS gained from Wrath of Air Totem and Wizard Oil.  You need to be packing over 800 spell damage after buffs to match this with Windfury.  Even in situations where you cannot use Consecration, this setup adds 30.07 TPS, requiring ~500 spell damage to match it with Windfury.<br>
<br>
As soon as you're tanking more than 1 mob, there's no contest, and Wrath of Air leaves everything else in the dust.</div>

</div>Yes, he's mainly loosing light's grace (hps), healing light (hps and hpm) and illumination (hpm). The spriest mana and group healing (he'll need VE when there is AoE dmg, dont think he can do enough HPS with flash to keep group + tank up) should make up for the HPM losses. Assuming he can keep the tank up (even if needed with max rank HL), everything else is down to execution.</div>

</div>To be fair though, you can't assume 100% uptime in AoE situations on Redoubt+Holy Shield, so your comment essentially is "Get more avoidance gear because that'll help you take less damage."  Uncrushable really has nothing to do with that though, unless you get to be passively uncrushable, which requires slightly better gear than most people at TW.</div>

</div>As it happens, I'm currently logged out in my Morogrim add tanking set, so you can take a look at the armory for a couple of ideas.  Just pretend I wasn't too lazy to enchant my weapon.  It's also worth noting that we've only killed him once.  I had much less +healing (and more spell damage) when we did kill him, by the way, though I think the difference in boss survival had more to do with the number of AoEers we had available.<br>
<br>
Pretty much, you just want to cram as much +healing in as you can without becoming crittable.  The better the healers are at managing threat, the less you need, which will give you more freedom to put on more mitigation or spell damage gear.<br>
<br>
Make sure the people you'll be healing to get aggro have Blessing of Light and Amplify Magic, especially BoL.<br>
<br>
It's also possible to use a holy paladin to get healing aggro and have a prot paladin pull the adds off him with Consecration.  The holy paladin will need to be able to survive a few seconds of being hit.  This approach will let each paladin wear more specialized gear, which could be useful if your healing set is poor.<br>
<br>
P.S. tank the melee adds on Solarian.  The "rotate challenging shout" approach is pretty silly by comparison.</div>

		<div id="post_message_607420">You won't have 100% uptime, but you'll block more as uncrushable than crushable. You can say it's because of your higher avoidance, but it doesn't matter. Also block rating is actually useful on both AOE tanking (as a blocked attack does very little dmg there, of course this varies depending on what you tank) and is also helpful for getting uncrusheable.<br>
You're right though, that at the end the general avoidance+block rating for the downtime of holy shield/redoubt and pure avoidance for when it's up (if you're already uncrushable as during those times additional block rating does nothing) is what really matters, and large amounts of avoidance are probably preferable to uncrushability. Of course, block rating is also much easier to get due to rating conversions and item budget. So at the end while it's not the direct reason, being uncrusheable will mostly be better than not on aoe tanking.</div>

</div>The rule of thumb is +2 spelldamage ~= +1 TPS, so 143 spelldamage is roughly a 70 TPS boost.  Windfury is roughly 20% more melee and SoR threat, so your total melee + SoR threat needs to be around 350 TPS to break even.  If I were to hazard a guess, I'd say WoA+oil is better at lower gear levels, but WF overtakes it by T5 or so.<br>
<br>
Of course, if you're using SoV, WoA+oil will probably always be better.<br>

</div>EoD obviously requires a warrior, but after our first messy kill, we've had rather more success with a paladin tank for EoA. Soul scream actually seems a lot less dangerous for mana users with a small mana pool, and after the first (which hits for about 7k total), they all look more or less like this:<br>

</div>The second part is the mana burn damage. I don't think any were over 4k total, while they were often hitting our warrior for 11k, with the potential for 8k+ crushings and aura ticks. I've never been crushed by EoA, and although I guess it's possible if HS expires just after a soul scream with slow healing, it's fairly unlikely. Together this makes the potential burst much, much lower and so it's considerably easier to heal - I don't think I dropped much under 50% hp on last night's kill. We also found threat was less of an issue (although obviously there's no option of taunt/mocking blow/commanding shout chains at the end of the fight) due to the damage scaling. Avenging wrath+icon of the silver crescent at a decent damage multiplier provides a lot of threat.</div>

		<div id="post_message_608557">Yes, that's correct. Most of the Black Temple boss bits were written before I'd experienced them myself, and at the time I'd never heard of any Protection Paladin succesfully tanking Essence of Anger, so I assumed that part of the fight to also be better doable with a Warrior.<br>
<br>
However it appears Soul Scream follows the same burn mechanics as any power burn does, which means it does a mere 0.5 damage per mana, while it does do 10 damage per rage.<br>
<br>
I really need to update some of those.<br>
<br>
Edit: I've updated the little boss tidbits. Reliquary of Souls is now corrected to state that you are definitely a viable tank for phase 3, Mother Shahraz is slightly expanded, and I've added a Zul'Aman section.</div>

		<div id="post_message_608583">Actually I'd argue (pretty heavily) that pallies are the strongest tank for RoS P3, especially if you use the seethe trick.<br>
<br>
The ability to frontload aggro is a paladin staple, even if attempting to use the shield toss could well turn you into more of a punching bag than an effective tank, activating Seethe (other tank taunts and you spam yours to yank it off, while all DPS sits in the corner for 10 seconds), gaining the 300% aggro modifier, and tripping AW is simply unreal.  Bribe a hunter to MD durring that period and it's just not realistic that you will be caught.<br>
<br>
The ability to burn mana like it's going out of style, by spamming Righteous Fury if nothing else, doesn't hurt either.  And don't forget you can hit him with Exorcism.<br>
<br>
Though we've only downed him the once, so I can hardly pretend I'm an expert, I think that the paladin mechanics lend themselves a bit more.<br>
<br>
Out of curiousity, how do you handle P1 with a threat trinket?  Admittedly I still have the T4 helm (do.  not. ask.), but I was getting hit pretty regularly, and could not tank him for more than maybe 5-6 fixates, and that's with 2 avoidance trinkets.  We really didn't want to use more than 3 'tank' suited people (one of the primary tanks has full S2/heavy S3, so just wore that with a shield for the stamina), but we found ourselves having to ask a pally to step up for a fixate or two before he went down, and it's not like we often reached the third enrage.

		<div id="post_message_608615">Phase one is somewhat more annoying than when I used to wear very heavily block oriented gear and could tank most of the phase with help at enrages. I find I can probably do about 8 or 9 fixates and end up at 40% health or so with sensible use of shields/BoSac from other paladins and so on. Usually with two rogues for enrages, our P2 warrior and feral druid can handle the rest of P1 (last night we only had one rogue, which was a pain, but we cycled a few people). We usually kill EoS just before/during/after the second enrage, so there's not a massive amount of damage to be soaked. Overall, you can use a lot of people for P1 if needed (although it's easier with as few tanks as possible), whereas the requirements for P2 and P3 are more stringent.</div>

		<div id="post_message_609105">Background: I'm a paladin in a 3/5 Hyjal 4/9 BT guild (we made all our BT progression and the latter two MH kills this most recent week), so that ought to give you some idea as to our gearing level.  The protadin that we had been grooming for the role of tanking the Hyjal trash got banned a few days ago, and the mantle of protadin has fallen to me (since my prot gear was the best, and I also have great holy gear already for BT).<br>
<br>
Tanking the trash last night was my first experience, and considering it's Azgalor trash (arguably the hardest), I'm doing fine in my current gear.  I think I require a little more healing than would be normal, but on the whole I could hold aggro and didn't get gibbed instantly.<br>
<br>
The Armory: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304051424/http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Korgath&amp;n=Retcon" target="_blank">The World of Warcraft Armory</a><br>
<br>
The Question: Our guild only raids three nights a week, but are considering going back and doing some older raids to key recruits / alts / etc on our off-nights.  They also want to take the opportunity to gear me as best they can for prot to make me tanking (and others healing me) easier.  Given the drop tables in SSC, TK, and Gruul, what are the biggest and most substantial upgrades - or better said - assuming perfect droprates, where is our time best spent?<br>
<br>
In case my Armoury is bugged / shows soloing or other gear:<br>
<br>
Head: Tankatronic Goggles, Powerful Earthstorm Diamond, Enduring Talasite, Glyph of the Defender<br>
Shoulders: Pauldrons of Stone Resolve, Solid Stars, Greater Inscription of the Knight<br>
Neck: Barbed Choker of Discipline<br>
Cloak: Pepe's Cloak of Pacification, Dodge Rating<br>
<i>Chest: Jade-Skull Breastplate, 150 Health</i><br>
Wrist: The Seeker's Wristguards, Fortitude<br>
Hands: Iron Gauntlets of the Maiden, Solid Stars, Heavy Knothide Armour Kit<br>
Waist: Crimson Girdle of the Indomitable, Solid Stars<br>
<i>Legs: Timewarden's Leggings, Solid Stars, Clefthide Leg Armour</i><br>
Feet: Battlescar Boots, Solid Stars, Fortitude<br>
Ring: Shermanar Great-Ring<br>
Ring: Violet Signet of the Protector<br>
Trinket: Adamantine Figurine<br>
<i>Trinket: Violet Badge</i><br>
<br>
Weapon: Gladiator's Gavel, Major Spellpower<br>
Shield: Shield of Impenetrable Darkness, Major Stamina<br>
Libram: Libram of Repentance<br>
<br>
I'm several percentage points past uncrushable, something like 107% with kings-only.  Italicized are the items I'd most like to replace, either because they are blues, or because I don't think they are contributing much (in the case of my second trinket).<br>
<br>
Recommendations are invited, and thank you in advance.</div>

		<div id="post_message_609151">There's a few possible upgrade paths I can see.<br>
<br>
For your trinkets, I'd personally say <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28528"><span><span class="purplename">[Moroes' Lucky Pocket Watch]</span></span></a> and <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=31858"><span><span class="purplename">[Darkmoon Card: Vengeance]</span></span></a> are pretty close to the best trinkets available. Alternatively <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30629"><span><span class="purplename">[Scarab of Displacement]</span></span></a> is quite good; it's from Hydross. I actually wish I had that trinket for resist fights, the defense is very handy. Alternatively grabbing a <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34049"><span><span class="purplename">[Battlemaster's Audacity]</span></span></a> ain't bad either.<br>
<br>
As far as chest pieces go, Nightbane drops <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28597"><span><span class="purplename">[Panzar'Thar Breastplate]</span></span></a>; alternatively just going either for Kael (Which would take a while) or Magtheridon (Which is fairly fast in comparison) for a tier chest should work as well. The best chest you can get until a tier 6 chest is probably <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33522"><span><span class="purplename">[Chestguard of the Stoic Guardian]</span></span></a>, available for 75 Badges of Justice.<br>
<br>
For legs I'd recommend either <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28621"><span><span class="purplename">[Wrynn Dynasty Greaves]</span></span></a>, tier 5 legs, or <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33515"><span><span class="purplename">[Unwavering Legguards]</span></span></a>. Tier 4 legs are also an option, but I've never really liked them.<br>
<br>
With the combination of badges and simply some good gear from it I'd say Karazhan is quite good if your guild can fit it in. Since you mention 3 raiding days a night, perhaps it could be filled in one of the other 4 days in the week? Just see if you can get 10 people together, it'll also be a chance to get some tanking practice.</div>

</div>Also, don't forget to judge Crusader.  Your spell damage should be higher if you can manage it.  If you have to make sacrifices, make sacrifices in terms of avoidance as long as you can without becoming crushable, and then make sacrifices in terms of health.<br>
<br>
Typically it is easier to trade health for spell damage in terms of gear available so you may have to do that.  Chances are you should be taking some more paladin tank gear instead of warrior tank gear.</div>

</div>What kind of DPS are you having trouble against?  Do they vastly out gear you?  250 +dmg should be fine through starting TK/SSC.  I'm assuming you are talking about trash mobs.  If not, pop AW on pull and every cooldown.<br>
<br>
As for skill usage, here is what I do (my stats: 14.8k hp unbuffed, ~340 + dmg, 36 sp hit, + precision &amp; CE):<br>
<br>
<br>
SoR -&gt; Shield pull -&gt; Consecrate (typically rank 2, unless I know it's important to lock aggro (i.e. AoE pull) or I'm going to get enough dmg in to replace the mana used) just before first would reach you.  This gets a tick on the mobs sooner.<br>
JoR <br>
HS<br>
repeat SoR/JoR &amp; HS till dead.  Unless there are 4+ mobs alive by the time Consecrate refreshes, I don't usually re-consecrate.<br>
<br>
This maintains ~600 tps, which should allow around 950 sustained DPS.  When more threat is needed, SoCr and TPS goes up significantly (usually 800ish).  <br>
<br>
Boss mobs, I spam R2 consecrate or higher as mana allows.<br>
<br>
Maybe your problem is people opening early or poor target selection.  If you get feared/stunned/knockdown a lot, it hurts your aggro in multi mob pulls.  Take the pulls to Attumen.  You get knocked down, which prevents blocks = less aggro.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Out of curiousity, how do you handle P1 with a threat trinket?  Admittedly I still have the T4 helm (do.  not. ask.), but I was getting hit pretty regularly, and could not tank him for more than maybe 5-6 fixates, and that's with 2 avoidance trinkets.  We really didn't want to use more than 3 'tank' suited people (one of the primary tanks has full S2/heavy S3, so just wore that with a shield for the stamina), but we found ourselves having to ask a pally to step up for a fixate or two before he went down, and it's not like we often reached the third enrage.  I'm very surprised to hear that you can afford the trinket slot for Icon.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Tank stands in until the first enrage. Keep sheild block or Holy Shield up constantly and you should only take 300 or so damage per hit if I'm not mistaken.<br>
<br>
First enrage, rogue steps in, takes fixate and uses evasion.  Tanks for duration of enrage.<br>
<br>
Second tank stands in until enrage.  Shield Block or Holy Shield.<br>
<br>
Second enrage, rogue steps in, evasion tanks.<br>
<br>
If he's not dead by now, a bear steps in.  Tank gear or not doesn't really matter.  <br>
<br>
Third enrage, if you actually get here, hopefully you have a third rogue, otherwise improvise.  He should be dead by now or chances are you probably wont have the dps to get through p3 anyways.<br>
<br>
Keeping up shield block or holy shield really minimizes the amount of damage you take.  If you're taking too much damage, you may think about putting on more shield block value.</div>

I use it for grinding and soloing ZG bosses, but on a fight where I need to hold aggro on 10 mobs, I'm not exactly worried about my healing.  If I die due to lack of heals on ghouls/aboms/fiends, that's not because I had a spell damage trinket on - it's because 1: healers suck, 2: I'm undergeared or 3: some other effect happened (abom stun, then get crushed or hit a lot or necros target me and beat my face in with shadowbolts)</div>

For legs I'd recommend either <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28621"><span><span class="purplename">[Wrynn Dynasty Greaves]</span></span></a>, tier 5 legs, or <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33515"><span><span class="purplename">[Unwavering Legguards]</span></span></a>. Tier 4 legs are also an option, but I've never really liked them.<br>
<br>
With the combination of badges and simply some good gear from it I'd say Karazhan is quite good if your guild can fit it in. Since you mention 3 raiding days a night, perhaps it could be filled in one of the other 4 days in the week? Just see if you can get 10 people together, it'll also be a chance to get some tanking practice.</div>

</div>I run at least one ZA a week, as well as a Karazhan.  This also nets me ~33 badges a week, which will probably end up getting put towards the pants/legs.  In addition to the ~20 or so I have now, I'm hoping that I'll be able to pick up a new chest or legs from badges in a week or two.<br>
<br>
I'm working on a DMC:V to replace the Violet Badge, and the Scarab might be a welcome addition if we can run SSC.  Ring upgrades seem to be from Morogrim (Sundered Souls) or TK Trash (Tirisfalen).  For the chest, unless Nightbane (edit: ore Zul'jin) cooperates next week, it's probably going to be the badge one, as we have no interest in doing Mag, and we'll probably skip Kael for a few weeks until we need to key people.</div>

</div>I'm glad you pointed this out.  I spec holy for BT, and I think that I've never had a hard look at the paladin-specific tanking drops out of BT (I just happened to pick up the Seekers Wristguards, unexpectedly, last week).<br>
<br>
Best belt in the game?  Gurtogg, who we'll be working on.  Best boots in the game?  Naj'entus, who we have on farm.  The gauntlets off Teron went to our MT prot warrior, so I'm next in line for them (we dont use warrior offtanks).  The ring from Supremus might get competition from druids, and I'm happy to pass it to them, but that's also within striking distance.<br>
<br>
I think we may only focus on the upgrades from ZA/Kara/badges, and if we pick up some recruits that need attuning, I'll get stuff from SSC/TK then.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Out of curiousity, how do you handle P1 with a threat trinket?  Admittedly I still have the T4 helm (do.  not. ask.), but I was getting hit pretty regularly, and could not tank him for more than maybe 5-6 fixates, and that's with 2 avoidance trinkets.  We really didn't want to use more than 3 'tank' suited people (one of the primary tanks has full S2/heavy S3, so just wore that with a shield for the stamina), but we found ourselves having to ask a pally to step up for a fixate or two before he went down, and it's not like we often reached the third enrage.  I'm very surprised to hear that you can afford the trinket slot for Icon.</div>

</div>While my Tankadin Alt will likely never set foot in Black Temple my Warrior is the Main Tank of my Guild so I can give you a tip I haven't seen mentioned in the thread:<br>
<br>
When you are on the ramp before RoS, there is a period where you will drop out of combat before you run down to the Reliquary itself. You can use this period (if you are fast) to quickly apply a <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=23576"><span><span class="whitename">[Greater Ward of Shielding]</span></span></a> and give you 4000 points of damage absorption right off the bat.<br>
I also have our Prot Paladin bless me with Sanctuary, and make sure your Warriors are keeping up Thunderclap and Demoralizing Shout.<br>
If you begin to drop low on health, while Last Stand isn't an option for you, <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32501"><span><span class="purplename">[Shadowmoon Insignia]</span></span></a> and <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=22797"><span><span class="whitename">[Nightmare Seed]</span></span></a> can be used to great effect to allow you to tank the phase for a bit longer.<br>
Provided you use the Shielding you really can get away with using any sort of gearing.<br>
<br>
Typically in my threat gear, I would have sufficient health to tank up to the first enrage, which is evasion tanked by a Rogue, and most of the remaining time left before he's been killed and re-enters the Reliquary.</div>

Imagine my surprise when at Prince, my &gt;500 spell damage RF'ed MD'ed self gets aggro pulled off by a warlock in half greens less than 15 seconds into the fight.  It was kinda embarassing to flawlessly tank an entire Hyjal run then almost wipe at Prince due to an aggro pull. :P</div>

I do know I can't specifically remember it ever happening to me, but due to the fact that I always forget about Righteous Fury I frequently find myself not re-buffing it until after it's run out for a while. It could be it's related to actually refreshing the ability.</div>

		<div id="post_message_610279">The main pattern I've seen is with large bosses or bosses that traditionally have had problems being in the consecrate aura. Prince is such an example; he always has had a weird consecrate issue. They were supposed to have fixed this in 2.2 but it's possible they just broke it in a different way. <br>
<br>
Remember - if Omen is reporting that you have low threat, it's because you're outputting low threat due to what damage you're doing. It's not because of an RF bug. <br>
<br>
I've seen a couple times when a mob would just go away even though I had tons of threat on it, supposedly. Casting RF with a full mana bar seems to have fixed this.</div>

		<div id="post_message_610902">Yeah, I've had some REALLY embarrassing runs recently where I would lose aggro for no apparent reason. Several to the point of the others calling the instance bugged and calling the run. <br>
<br>
Since I found the initial comments about this, I re-cast RF as the last buff when there are total buffs flying around, and against before every boss or critical pull I know I have to hold aggro. RF rarely gets below 25 minutes remaining, but I would prefer to regularly cast it than have aggro issues. So far this appears to keep the issue from re-occuring.<br>
<br>
I have posted about it in my guild forums, and a few people have been chiming in with comments, mainly about wondering where it 'breaks', since sometimes the loss of aggro was immediate, sometimes it took 30-45 seconds. Looking back, I think the biggest difference (in the fights where 'wierd aggro' happened) in the duration was the fights where I had nearly every source of threat generation vs just one or two. A few sources would be almost immediate loss, where I would hold it longer when I was generating more threat from HS, spiritual attunement, 3 or 4 damage shield buffs, etc...<br>
<br>
The problem may also be related to fixing the previous mana cost issue with RF, though I don't really know how.<br>
<br>
I'm not really willing to risk losing aggro any more to test out some of these theories, but please, if you all have noticed similar issues, post about them. Any information at all might help to pinpoint the problem.</div>

		<div id="post_message_611042">One working theory over at Maintankadin is as follows:<br>
<br>
This bug is related to the double mana bug. It was proven that there is actually a hidden occurrence of Righteous Fury being cast at the same time via purge. The bug is that sometimes you will recieve the actual Improved RF buff, while other times your threat is being modified by the hidden buff, which is not affected by talents, and thus generating only 60% extra aggro instead of 90% extra aggro. <br>
<br>
Omen/KTM read that you have selected the talents, and therefore assume IRF is being applied properly. This leads to losing aggro even though being reported as on top of the threat meter.<br>
<br>
I have had this occur to me a few times. Everyone in the raid saw I was on top of the threat meter, but it was pulled off by another melee anyway.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Has there been math done on the exact equivalency points (like a rogue's AEP) for certain stats?  I see in the first post you compare the mitagtion points to 1% to uncrushable, but what about things like stamina, intellect, mp/5, and spell damage?<br>
<br>
I'm looking for something I can use with the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302201954/http://www.curse.com/downloads/details/8214/" target="_blank">Pawn addon</a>, which assigns a certain point value to each stat, and then adds it up - it's an easy and fast way to tell what gear is best.  I believe there's a mod called 'tank points' or something, that's similar.<br>
<br>
From the OP I divided 1 by each of the values needed to get 1%, and then multiplied by 10 so they're a bit bigger than hundreths of a point (so something with a block value of 18 is seen as more than .03 higher than a value of 15)<br>
<br>
BlockRating=1.26<br>
DefenseRating=0.6<br>
DodgeRating=0.5<br>
ParryRating=0.4<br>
Agility=0.4<br>
<br>
Now, who's done the math that says 'X' stamina will increase your survival as much as 'Y' armor?  Where do I rate Stamina, ArmorRating, SpellDamage, Intellect, MP/5, etc?  I'd like to know, for example, at what point does higher armor become better than the defense on an item.  Should I drop 22 defense for 15 block rating?  Etc.<br>
<br>
I've searched this thread, I didn't see anything under 'pawn string', 'tank points' or 'equivalency points'...<br>
<br>
I understand that we're stacking to a goal, and the closer you get to said goal, the less a certain is important.  However, just as a general guideline...</div>

</div>This is a fairly dated post, but it wasn't ever addressed as far as I can see. I too would like to come up with a good set of point values for various stats such that I can use <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302201954/http://www.curse.com/downloads/details/8214/" target="_blank">Pawn </a>or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302201954/http://www.lootzor.com/" target="_blank">Lootzor </a>to compare various pieces of gear quickly and easily. I don't have a single, unified valuation, but what I did come up with are two different valuations: one that compares the contribution of an item toward uncrushability and the other that compares the contribution of an item in terms of time to live vs. melee attacks.<br>
<br>
The first evaluation is easy. All I had to do was take the avoidance values from the first post and normalize for 1 pt. = 1 def. rating. I came up with...<br>
<br>
Agility = 0.660<br>
Defense Rating = 1.000<br>
Dodge Rating = 0.794<br>
Parry Rating = 0.670<br>
Block Rating = 1.899<br>
<br>
(Basically, it's the same as Remraf did, only normalized to a different number.) This evaluation will compare the contribution of two items towards uncrushability, which is useful if you are trying to maintain 102.4% avoidance and tweak other stats.<br>
<br>
The second evaluation is more complicated, because time to live depends on (a) incoming damage, (b) armor, (c) health, and (d) block value. (I did a "worst case" evaluation, so I don't factor in avoidance at all. I also didn't count agility's minor contribution to armor, although I probably should have added it in.)<br>
<br>
I wrote a calculator to determine the relative values of 1 armor, 1 stamina, and 1 block value with respect to time to live. If you have Google Docs, you can see the shared version here:<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302201954/http://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=pzvDSQmQvVfo2PJHdZ4v4Vw&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Tanking Stat Weights</a><br>
<br>
The calculator takes a base point and calculates the values of these various stats about the base point, taking into account talents. If you put in your current stats as a base, as well as a (very basic) damage profile for a boss you expect to face, you can get Pawn values for these three stats (arbitrarily normalized for 1 STA = 2 pts.).<br>
<br>
I played around with some numbers, and (as expected) the general trends are:<br>
* As incoming hit sizes decreases, the value of Block Value increases<br>
* For very small hits sizes (ie AOE tanking), Block Value far outweighs the other two stats<br>
* As Block Value increases it feeds itself, become still more valuable<br>
* Armor and Stamina exhibit diminishing returns (they become less valuable in relation to other stats as you get more of them)<br>
<br>
I don't have a good way to put my two comparison evaluations together, or to add in threat values, but this could be a start in the right direction anyway.</div>

		<div id="post_message_615553">Greetings, I apologize if this has already been asked and responded to:<br>
<br>
I was wondering about trinket stat priority.  For some reason I've had it in my head that it's essential to grab trinkets ONLY if they have a +Stamina rating on them.  Is this always the case or is it situational?  I've passed up many trinkets drops in the past because despite their usefulness, I've turned my nose up on them due to their lack of +Stamina.  Any advice would be appreciated.</div>

		<div id="post_message_615786">You should really try grabbing a wide assortment of different trinkets. I'd recommend double stamina trinkets if you're uncrushable without needing your trinket slots but your health is still under the ~18-19k buffed, after that point I'd recommend swapping in an avoidance trinket with a clickable effect that'll help you stay alive in an emergency.<br>
<br>
Beyond that basic advice it's also worth looking at what trinkets provide you in different situations, for example if you're tanking all the adds at Hydross using two avoidance trinkets with clickable avoidance effects is likely to be better than stamina trinkets, since the temporary buffs from the trinkets will be up for most of the time you're tanking. The same would count for Morogrim's Murlocs if you have trouble surviving them (As opposed to having trouble not running completely out of mana despite spamming mana potions like you'll have after a certain level of gear).<br>
<br>
In BT Gurtogg and RoS are also great fights for clickable avoidance trinkets. Resist fights in which you need to stay uncrittable are, on the other hand, fights which are perfect for using +defense trinkets on. There's even some fights in which having a trinket you can click for extra spell damage (and threat) is really good.<br>
<br>
I personally keep a selection of ~6 different trinkets on me at all times for different situations. For AoE tanking I typically use an avoidance trinket combined with a threat trinket, for general tanking content I use a stamina trinket and an avoidance trinket, for fights where there's short periods of tanking followed by periods of standing around doing nothing much I use double avoidance trinkets, etc.</div>

My biggest question is what to spec, with the assumption that I'll be speccing specifically for this fight. Being unable to block elemental attacks, is there any reason at all to even pick up holy shield? Would it be more worthwhile to spec partially into holy, throw on a healing weapon/shield after P2 and spot heal, or just spec fully for survivability/threat?<br>

		<div id="post_message_616373">I'd recommend picking up the bracers. Your guild is best off killing your flame last in my opinion, the need to wear a resist set combined with consecration being hard to use due to the movement needed, as well as the incapability of using Holy Shield for threat all add up to your threat not being all that good. The fact that the flames are demons so you can use Exorcism does slightly make up for it, but both warrior and druid tanks should be producing better threat (As the flames barely affect their abilities to generate threat).<br>
<br>
I'd recommend trying to spec as much for survivability as possible. Your healing capabilities in the kind of gear you'll need to survive the flames is going to suck regardless of whether you spec somewhat in Holy, and even if you don't pick up Holy Shield and the talents along the lines you'll probably still want to go at least 40 into Prot for Combat Expertise. Your 0/43/18 would look best just for the purposes of tanking the flames.<br>
<br>
As for what you'll do the remainder of the fight, I guess you can keep up a judgement, or alternatively just pick your nose somewhere off in a corner and hope you get targeted for Agonizing Flames a lot.</div>

		<div id="post_message_616560">For gems I'd just recommend Stamina all over the place for the most part. The only exception generally being +stamina socket bonuses which you can pick up with just a single non-Stamina gem. The reasoning for this is mostly that you get a lot more bang for your back from Stamina gems because you got roughly 1.5 times of any other stat's worth; not to mention that with all our talents added together we have a very high stamina multiplier; Combat Expertise, Sacred Duty and Blessing of Kings together add up to a 28% increase to your Stamina, which really increases the amount of stam you get per gem to easily beat what you'd get from anything else. That is all assuming you don't need the gems for uncritability or uncrushability; if you do need gems for that I'd recommend using Enduring and Shifting gems.<br>
<br>
As for talent spec, there's a few possible specs people tend to go for. I've personally gone for Pursuit of Justice over Spell Warding, but that's more of a personal convenience thing. For survivability Spell Warding is better, and if I'm honest, for raiding in general Spell Warding is better, you can get half the increased movement speed by using Boar's Speed on your boots. You can also argue Improved Blessing of Might versus Benediction, I've personally gone for Improved Blessing of Might as the situations in which I find myself low on mana really wouldn't be helped much by lowering my Seal/Judgement cost by 15%, as well as the fact that I'm the only Paladin in my guild who has Improved Blessing of Might. Alternatively you could drop the same talents that you can use to pick up Pursuit of Justice to pick up Improved Seal of the Crusader instead, however ISotC's effect is really just limited to making Judgement of the Crusader less "selfish" to use; crits aren't all that important for our threat, and it could also be argued that if you're the maintank that using a Judgement to maximize your threat is far from selfish in the first place.<br>
<br>
I also prefer One-Handed Weapon Specialization over Reckoning due to it's reliability (As well as the fact that's it's better for AoE aggro; though Reckoning is very good if you're in a situation with a lot of stuff hitting you where you also need to keep aggro on one particular mob), though I've never run the numbers on which of the two is factually better. Obviously you can go for a higher threat spec by dropping an avoidance talent in favor of Reckoning, Anticipation would be the most likely choice for dropping in favor of Reckoning since it's the lowest avoidance boost of your talents, though dropping Deflection instead would be better in case you tank a lot of resist fights.<br>
<br>
As it's easier to just link builds, here's a few examples of the builds I'm talking about.<br>
Basic maximum survivability build: <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?talent=sZVhtIx0dMgqtVbx" target="_blank">Talent Calculator - World of Warcraft</a><br>
Variation on the above with Pursuit of Justice: <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?talent=sZVhxIx0zMgqtVbx0h" target="_blank">Talent Calculator - World of Warcraft</a> (Note that this build doesn't have Kings, which is in my opinion suboptimal for 10-mans; I've personally dropped a single point from One-Handed Weapon Specialization instead)<br>
High threat/survivability build: <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?talent=sZVhtI00dggqtVbx" target="_blank">Talent Calculator - World of Warcraft</a><br>
<br>
There's a few less common specs as well, which are better suited if you're not a Maintankadin.<br>
Really high threat build: <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?talent=sZVhtI00zgToxVfx0hMz" target="_blank">Talent Calculator - World of Warcraft</a><br>
Prot/Holy: <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?talent=sVVdbxZVhtIx0zMTot" target="_blank">Talent Calculator - World of Warcraft</a> (This spec becomes less good if you pick up a good amount of high mana/5 healing gear; if I need to heal I barely notice not having Illumination any more because I've geared around not having it)<br>
<br>
Edit: Reading this post makes me wonder why I have so much trouble actually writing a proper talent section for the first post. I guess I'll modify the above a bit to fit in the first post better tomorrow.</div>

</div>I tank flames every week.  My spec is suboptimal at the moment as I fat fingered my talents when I specced back from Ret after doing karazhan and didn't get spell warding.<br>
<br>
I don't really have a lot of advice, if you cap FR, and become crit immune, and high enough health, then all you need to worry about is threat.  Now, I wouldn't recommend speccing particularly for this fight unless you specifically have to. (IE: The only reason you're speccing prot at all is to tank flames) in which case, I don't know, you might even be fine to do it as a holy spec with iRF.  <br>
<br>
Really flame tanking is 3 things. 1: Gearing up, and you're there. 2: Learning positioning/Boundaries, and how to get out of the way of eye beam, and 3: Learning exactly how far to move to avoid blaze damage before it starts ticking.  My FR gear is a set picked up one afternoon after my raid leader sent me a tell asking if I could tank flames.  It's a combination of crafted pieces, gemmed with resilience and stamina and normal gear, some pvp gear, and badge boots.  It looks much poorer than yours probably. <br>
<br>
I don't die, unless I screw up and stand in stacked blazes, or eat eye beam.  Threat is lower than normal, so I'm the second one killed. Judge crusader etc.  But assuming DPS can watch their own threat, you can tank it for a very long time even if threat is low.<br>
<br>
I would get the bracers of the two, just because it's probably something that will help your gear set past this encounter.  This encounter is completely about execution, and as long as you can execute it correctly, and have capped FR and can't be crit, you will be fine.  If you can't execute it correctly, no gear can help you.</div>

</div>I've been considering the same build.  I think it was off-tanking hex-lord as 0/48/13 that made me really consider it, as once all four adds are down there is literally nothing useful to do for a paladin off-tank but heal.  I tanked the adds in mostly healing gear, but after adds are down I was pretty useless with all of the spell push-back the spirit bolt ability churns out.</div>

</div>I'd say that should work well enough; I'm reasonably capable of off-healing with no points in Holy whatsoever. I frequently do things like healing an Infernal tank at Anetheron or healing a Doomguard tank at Azgalor by myself with no real issues. Grabbing some additional points in Holy should only serve to make it easier. I'll admit I'm slightly "spoiled" gear wise though, we've had a lot of off-set healing gear drop, combined with some badge rewards, putting me in a mix of tier 5/6 quality mail/plate healing gear, with 1850 +healing and 185 mana/5.<br>

The lack of spell pushback protection is what mostly annoys me, but that's only really an issue in a handful of fights. I typically try asking a resto shaman for Earth Shield if I'm grouped with him and he doesn't need to use it on someone tanking (I provide the resto shaman himself with concentration aura, covering his pushback immunity), which combined with concentration aura gives you 70% pushback resistance, which is generally enough (Hex-Lord is an exception).<br>
<br>
As for the tanking part, the 20/41/0 build I linked earlier was a spec I've used for most of my raiding life, I've tanked most bosses with it. Your 13/48/0 should be even better because it doesn't lack Ardent Defender. The 5% parry less does sting a bit, but it's not insurmountable.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">My guild has just recently started BT/Hyjal, and I was wondering if anyone had done a less-holy prot/holy build?  My tanking gear is good enough where I don't need the 5 points in Deflection to stay uncrushable.  I'm primarily an OT for my guild, and there seem to be a number of fights in BT/Hyjal where having more than 1 tank is really just a waste (which really sorta sucks).<br>
<br>
I was thinking something along the lines of <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?talent=sVxhZVhxIx0dMgqt" target="_blank">Prot/Holy</a>.  Has anyone done anything like this?  Were you even a reasonable off-healer?  How did you focus your gemming/gearing?</div>

</div>I run the 0/48/13 build for everything, and my only pain is when im not taking enough damage. Even healing, I have a mix of mail and plate healing gear, all of it chosen for +int and mp5 once past the +healing, including gemming. As a result, I only have about 12% crit, +1450 healing. I am clearly in the back of the healing meters, but no one expects me to be a rockin healer, just to help ease the strain on the healers. More specifically, the role I end up taking (especially on aoe-damage fights) I make sure that I get heals off on our holy paladins before they can heal themselves. I figure that my contribution to healing isn't normally keeping the MT or OT up, but rather by healing the holy pallys, I lend them my mana pool through spiritual attunement conversion.<br>
<br>
When that is not needed, I generally dance all over the board trying to heal who I can, and stick to flash of light even though it is widely considered as 'not the best option',  just to give someone a fast 2k health when they are REALLY low so they have time while a much bigger heal from a full time healer is incoming.<br>
<br>
I still generally end up with around 35-45% overhealed.</div>

Speaking of 13/48/0 vs. 0/49/12, I'm wondering if anyone here has had any success running a 20/41 or 13/48 variant on an arena team? My palladin recently hit 70, and it's unlikely I'll have the gear set on him to MT anything raid-wise for a while yet. In the meantime, I'm trying to up my healing viability by doing a 5v5 with a bunch of friends' alts. Since we're all undergeared and generally underskilled, we pretty much suck, but one thing I did notice is that even in my "healing" gear it took forever for the other team to kill me.<br>
<br>
On thing that really hurt healing as prot in an arena was the spell pushback. I couldn't get any heals off whatsoever if I wasn't bubbled. I've been thinking of respeccing <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?talent=sVxuZV0tIxczMgqt" target="_blank">14/47/0</a> - picking up enough talents in Holy to eliminate spell pushback and help healing a bit. (Imp. concentration aura is a threat tradeoff with Precision, but it would help in arenas a good bit.) If I'm just running 5-mans at the moment, does anyone see a problem with this spec in terms of threat or tank viability? Has anyone tried it in that setting?</div>

		<div id="post_message_617412"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Your mileage may vary obviously, but I generally find that outside of 5-mans any mana you get from intellect pales in comparison to mana you can potentially get from other sources, and because of that you're better off using gems which either boost your survivability, or ones which affect your threat in a more direct manner.<br>
<br>
Having more int is semi-useful in case you switch to healing mid-fight, I guess, but it's more something I've always seen as "Um, well, you get it because it's on the set gear and on spell damage weapons, that's about it" rather than something to specifically gem for.<br>
<br>
Perhaps that's different for you, of course, but for me mana is either something that either overflows in supply or is woefully short, having a bit of extra mana to start with is a minor difference.<br>

There's also a decided lack of gems that provide intellect along with another useful stat.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I'd be one of the peopel questioning your sanity.  Mana issues are solved via many ways.  Judge wisdom.  Get a shaman for WF and Mana Spring.  Drink potions.  Those are my main ways of upping mana regen.  A shaman in particular cannot be undervalued.  With a shaman my mana longevity seems to go up remarkably between WF giving me extra JoW procs and mana spring.<br>
<br>
Additionally 490 is crit cap, not when defense stops helping you.  An eight defense rating gem gives you 3 1/3 defense.  This translates to .1 1/3 dodge, parry, miss and block.  That's .4 avoidance and some block percent.  As a tank your job is number one to live and number two to generate threat.  You can drink mana pots if you avoid too much for a while and need mana.  If you get hit too often and you die due to lack of total health and/or avoidance there is no pot to help you.  I generally gear myself for mass stamina as this allows me to absorb an extra few hits while upping my Ardent Defender range.  I don't wish to get into Effective Health theories here or how avoidance ties into this however as it is covered very well in other tanking threads in this forum.<br>
<br>
Additionally this may be cruel but I have no doubt I could tank Illidan without using a weapon.  My threat generation would suffer a ton and drag the fight out, but I could do it no sweat.

</div>Typically, we don't have a Shaman in the tanking group, but I can look into it. As far as defense helping you, it becomes a lot less efficient when you're uncrushable (as Elderin is). Remember that any additional block rating is useless when you are uncrushable (unless you get a corresponding decrease in dodge or parry). While Defense will increase your miss/dodge/parry, it will do nothing for block if you are uncrushable. Thus, a single defense gem (+8 defense rating) will increase your total avoidance by 0.4%. IMO, defense gems are pretty useless if you're already uncrushable. <br>
<br>
Elderin doesn't get hit a whole lot (stacked dodge so it's at 23% unbuffed) and when I use him to tank Gruul, he has over 18000 health and armor. I've been told that I take a lot less damage than most other tanks in Gruul's Lair but I don't know if that's true. <br>
<br>
I could go for Enduring Talestite for Defense and Stamina.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Here's a good explanation.   An 8 INT gem is worth 120 more mana over the course of any fight -- this is the same amount of mana you gain with any heal of 1200 cast on you.   Your max mana pool is completely irrelevant -- if you're having mana issues, socketing with gems is NOT going to fix it.  Get a BoW put on you, judge wisdom on the mob, quaff mana potions, all of those are actually useful.  By gemming with INT, you are throwing away a lot of possible hp/avoidance/threat options.<br>
<br>
edit:  I'd agree also that defense gems are largely useless, unless it's an enduring talasite that you're using to hit a good socket bonus.  Generally I try to keep my defense slightly over the cap, and look to make tradeoffs as I push over 500 from a new piece of gear.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The mage in me feels the need to comment, even though this has already been discussed.<br>
<br>
Int is trash for a prot paladin.  Aside from the fact that it only adds a paltry amount to the total mana used over the course of a fight (think of the 20,000+ mana used in high end encounters after you count SA), <u>spell damage is a better stat to pursue 100% of the time.</u>  Granted, there are certain gearsets where you don't have the option to choose between the stats (i.e. tiered gear), but if you have a choice between the two stats you should always pick spell damage.<br>
<br>
Spell damage simultaneously does two things for you: it makes you more EFFECTIVE, and it makes you more EFFICIENT.  Being more effective means you have the ability to dump threat much faster when it is needed.  This is incredibly useful on fights with threat wipes, while also being one of the main factors in your overall TPS.  But when comparing to int, efficiency is the main reason to go with spell damage.  It doesn't take much spell damage at all to cover the gap from what little mana you'd gain by going with int.  Simply put, each point of spell damage makes each point of mana that much more potent.<br>
<br>
This is the exact same reason DPS casters pick spell damage over int.  The only difference is we're looking at threat output rather than damage output, even though the two are very closely related for  us.<br>
<br>
FWIW, my "threat gem" of choice is a <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=24056" target="_blank">[Glowing Nightseye]</a>.  However, I only ever use it in red slots when the gem bonus is more stamina.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">My guild has just recently started BT/Hyjal, and I was wondering if anyone had done a less-holy prot/holy build?  My tanking gear is good enough where I don't need the 5 points in Deflection to stay uncrushable.  I'm primarily an OT for my guild, and there seem to be a number of fights in BT/Hyjal where having more than 1 tank is really just a waste (which really sorta sucks).<br>
<br>
I was thinking something along the lines of <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?talent=sVxhZVhxIx0dMgqt" target="_blank">Prot/Holy</a>.  Has anyone done anything like this?  Were you even a reasonable off-healer?  How did you focus your gemming/gearing?</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>I've done 12/49/0 and 0/48/13 and variations thereof, and my experience has been that the smattering of points in Holy really almost never makes a difference in your healing ability.  Your primary source of mana is still chain-chugged pots, and 12% bigger heals from an off-healer isn't likely to make or break anything.  The only thing I ever really miss is Spiritual Focus (assuming you go for that instead of Imp. SoR), and even that rarely.<br>
<br>
However, one could also argue that the extra parry from a prot/ret build makes very little difference on Hyjal trash, since the situations where your life is threatened (focused shadowbolts from Necros on a pull, or being smacked up after getting knocked over by an Abom) are the situations where parry makes no difference.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I have a question about gemming up my gear. I generally go for the socket bonus on all my gear. And, since Elderin is already at 490+ defense, I don't get defense gems. I generally get INT gems. <br>
<br>
The reason I do this is for more mana. Yet, I get a lot of comments that I have too much INT.<br>
<br>
In my current get up, I've tanked everything up to and including Gruul (successfully). So, I'm not convinced I'm doing anything wrong with my current gear set. <br>
<br>
Anyone have a good explanation?</div>

</div>Well, Gruul is a T4 boss, and you're wearing 5 pieces of T5 gear, all of them in fairly significant slots.  I'm not trying to minimize your accomplishment, but having strong base gear can overcome sub-optimal gemming.<br>
<br>
Intellect is not always entirely useless; having a decent mana pool on Voidreaver is nice, and tanking Al'ar adds definitely requires me to chain-chug those nethergon energy pots.  So I appreciate that some of our gear has the occasional "afterthought" intellect thrown in.  But it's not so broadly useful that it's worth gemming or enchanting for intellect.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The chain-chugging point you make here actually hurts the int argument rather than helping it.  Having more spell damage instead means each potion you chug is that much more threat you can crank out.  A base mana pool of 8,000 vs 6,000 is probably closer to 28,000 vs 26,000 on these fights.<br>
<br>
More spell damage on VR means your burst threat from the 20-second AW window is more potent, and your overall threat generation is higher.<br>
<br>
For Al'ar's adds, you don't need to constantly dump threat into them.  You only need "enough" to keep them off of the DPS.  You'll still need to chain-chug the pots, but again, higher spell damage makes each potion you use that much more effective.<br>
<br>
Really though, this topic has been beat to hell in this thread.  At this point I'd encourage Elderin to read the entire thread when you get a chance, as pretty much every argument for and against int has been brought up and discussed already.<br>
<br>
EDIT: I don't really have the time to do a detailed analysis, but I contend that all pally tanking gear would be better if the int were dropped and re-itemized into spell damage.  It would require us to play smarter to take advantage of the different stats, but is that really a bad thing?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Here's a good explanation.   An 8 INT gem is worth 120 more mana over the course of any fight -- this is the same amount of mana you gain with any heal of 1200 cast on you.   Your max mana pool is completely irrelevant -- if you're having mana issues, socketing with gems is NOT going to fix it.  Get a BoW put on you, judge wisdom on the mob, quaff mana potions, all of those are actually useful.  By gemming with INT, you are throwing away a lot of possible hp/avoidance/threat options.<br>
<br>
edit:  I'd agree also that defense gems are largely useless, unless it's an enduring talasite that you're using to hit a good socket bonus.  Generally I try to keep my defense slightly over the cap, and look to make tradeoffs as I push over 500 from a new piece of gear.</div>

</div>True, but paladin tanking gear already puts far more itemization value into spelldamage than into intellect (which is as it should be).  10 intellect has the same itemization value as 12 spelldamage, and if you evaluate them on that basis, the spelldamage is a better deal.  (And that's pretty much the way it works for gems and enchants.)<br>
<br>
But it's different when you're looking at items.  Due to the nonlinear scaling of itemization costs, going from zero to 10 intellect on an item costs far less than going from, say, 20 to 32 spelldamage.  In terms of bang for the buck, adding a little bit of intellect to gear that does't have any gets you more than adding spelldamage to gear that's already stacked with it.<br>

</div>If you're comparably geared to your dps and they don't suck, then you pretty much do need to constantly dump threat into them.  If you're tanking two at once, you can go easy on the second one once the first one dies, but overall you're still losing a decent chunk of mana per pair in phase 2.

Considering that the typical full-T6 prot paladin will probably only have 6 slots with any intellect at all (the 5 set pieces plus the weapon) I prefer having a modest amount of intellect on the set for the siuations where it really does help.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_617927"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->If the intellect were to be replaced I'd rather have it replaced with an avoidance stat the armor doesn't come with at the current time anyway. To take <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30991" target="_blank">[Lightbringer Chestguard]</a> as an example again, let's say we remove the intellect and turn it into Dodge Rating instead, that'd make it a very, very good item, as opposed to just a very good item.<br>
<br>
Though as Cathela said, having some Intellect on your gear is still nice. While it doesn't happen frequently that I think "Thank you intellect!", having a higher base mana does slightly delay the point you'll run OOM in fights where your incoming damage is low enough that you're slowly running OOM. <br>
<br>
To make a simplified example, let's say you burn through an average of 150 mana per second, to sustain infinitely you'd need to be taking at least 1500 damage per second, but instead you take enough damage to get an average of 130 mana per second back. If you have 7000 mana in this situation, it'd take you 350 seconds before you run out of mana, if you have 6000 mana on the other hand, you'd be looking at being OOM in 300 seconds. So while intellect does give a static amount of mana, if we look at your incoming versus your outgoing mana it can still end up giving you more time of running a full threat cycle than it might appear at first sight.<br>
<br>
The effect is too slight to really make it worth grabbing enchants or gems for however in my opinion, and is even more marginalized in situations where your incoming mana versus outgoing mana are farther apart, but there's certainly some benefit from having some intellect on our tanking gear.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I asked the same question a while ago, just from a curiosity perspective (my paladin is freshly 70). The answers seems to be: mixing Seal of Righteousness and Seal of Vengeance is doable, but risky. When it works, it results in better DPS. When it doesn't, it results in SoV dropping and significantly worse DPS. A slightly safer bet is to just go SoV, which at low spell damage levels exceeds the threat of SoR. An even safer bet is to skip SoV entirely and go with SoR, which eliminates the resist/miss string issue which can cause SoV to fall and threat spikiness. SoV is also more prone to bad streaks when you are using a fast weapon. (Or, at least that is the consensus around here. I can't recall if I've seen the math to back that up.)<br>
<br>
My general feeling from reading through the thread is that on raid bosses (high resist rates, high miss/dodge/parry) SoV is dangerous to use, while in 5-mans you're probably ok to use it as it will stick much better. Myself, I've only had experience with it in 5-mans, and I have generally concluded that my threat is good enough already to not bother with trying SoV over SoR.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>It is more likely that it was given a GCD in the beginning because it was a spell and that "defaulted" it to a GCD, and it simply hasn't been looked at closer since.

My general feeling from reading through the thread is that on raid bosses (high resist rates, high miss/dodge/parry) SoV is dangerous to use, while in 5-mans you're probably ok to use it as it will stick much better. Myself, I've only had experience with it in 5-mans, and I have generally concluded that my threat is good enough already to not bother with trying SoV over SoR.</div>

		<div id="post_message_619243"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I tend to go for socket bonuses when the bonus is useful and there's at least one blue socket in the item.  I've found that at my level of gear (around the beginning of T5), having extra "uncrushability points" gives me more options in switching gear around to maximize threat, avoidance, or health as required by the fight.  Sometimes an enduring talasite plus a socket bonus is the difference between being able to use a stamina trinket over a defense trinket, for example, which is worth far more than the few points of stamina I'd have on the socketed item with a solid star of elune.  At higher levels of gear, I expect this is less of an issue.<br>
<br>
Since my primary goal is flexibility in reaching uncrushable while maximizing health, all gems are either enduring talasite, shifting nightseye, or solid star of elune.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Our threat cycle is much simpler, by comparison.  I wouldn't mind if Holy Shield was taken off the GCD, but I don't think it's really hurting us the way it is.

Switching weapons incurs a GCD, which depending on the timing could be potentially annoying.  Weaving SoR and SoV is certainly the highest threat you can do, provided that the SoV stack doesn't drop off.  And since SoV is a proc per minute refresh (PPM / swings per minute = chance of application per swing - faster weapon means more swings per minutes means less chance per swing), there's no "perfect" time to switch between SoV and SoR to insure a refresh.  Your mileage might vary, but if too many stack drop off, then you're removing the entire benefit of SoV over SoR in the first place.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>"time till oom" is meaningless. The fight will last a certain duration regardless of how long you can last, and you want to maximize your threat during that time.<br>
<br>
If the fight is 5 minutes for example, wether you go oom in 2.5 minutes or 7 minutes doesn't matter. What matters is the amount of threat you put out, which depends on a lot more than just how fast you go oom. In fact, since starting mana is so insignificant, the amount of mana regened over those 5 minutes is much more significant than the starting mana.<br>
<br>
To demonstrate with an example:<br>
Let's say I spend 200 mana/sec, and gain 199 mana/sec. After a certain time T I will go oom. Now I gemmed 5 extra mp5. I will never go oom. My "time till oom" is infinitely longer than before. By your "time till oom" factor you're saying that adding that 5 mp5 will make me infinitely better, while it's not really true - reality is at best it'll add TPS equal to 1 X TPM, which is much much smaller than infinity.<br>
<br>
Don't be mislead by "time till oom" calculations. Lasting twice as long is not twice as good. The actual benefit of lasting twice as long depends on other factors (mostly your regen and efficiency), to the point where you can simply ignore the actual "time till oom" and just figure out how much threat you can do with the mana you have available on the given fight.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_623179">Basically pally tanks will always take a lot more damage unless you take a lot of small hits and block a large portion of them, which is the strength of the paladin. Improved righteous fury and 16k armor just doesn't beat a bear's armor cap or a warrior with defensive stance (+improved def stance vs spell warding when spell dmg is involved).<br>
<br>
He's using a lot of spell damage over tanking stats (in both gems and actual items), and has no expertese. While fixing that won't make him take a lot less damage to the point where you'll feel he doesn't take much, having expertese neck and bracers to reduce parries and increase HP will help as well as possibly socketing more stam/hp. Also make sure he has enough avoidance to be uncrushable (102.4% chance to be missed+dodge+parry+block against a lvl70 with holy shield active) for bosses. Rings and cloaks with armor (kara/badge/mag) are also very nice for staying alive.<br>
<br>
Note that on FLK both the hunter and his pet hit kinda hard, so I'm not surprised whoever is tanking BOTH them would take a considerable amount of damage. If your healers aren't having a hard time to heal him with the damage he takes and his HP then it's alright, but if you're having difficulties it helps to bring an extra tank - no deaths is more important than having that 1 extra dpser as the fight is very easy to beat enrage-wise if nobody dies.</div>

</div>A couple of notes:<br>
<br>
1.  On bosses that don't crush (kalatheras adds, bear boss, lynx boss, etc), you will take less damage than him in a lot of cases since his advantage in removing crushing blows is lost.<br>
<br>
2.  He doesn't have much of any avoidance, which would probably account for why yall took the same amount of overall damage.  <br>
<br>
In general, he took smaller hits than you did on average, but he took more of them, so it evened out in the overall damage department.  You have a lot more avoidance than he does.  It would be a guess, but I would be willing to be that would explain your bear boss as well.  He probably has less avoidance than the other tanks (But that is merely a guess).  Also, since the bear boss doesn't crush, he would probably be taking more damage than a bear tank (generalized statement which can be affected by gear levels obviously).<br>
<br>
The short answer is if you are happy with his threat and can live with his damage intake for now, leave him be, but talk to him about building a tanking set with some more dodge/parry/miss in it for when he might need it.</div>

		<!-- message -->
		<div id="post_message_623386">It's largely a class difference. A paladin will (generally) take more damage than other tanks when tanking by him or herself. That's due to a simple combination of factors:<br>
<br>
- Gearing is largely equal to what a Warrior can use. So lower armor than a feral druid.<br>
- Paladins don't have an equivalent to Demoralizing Shout/Roar, also making it so you take a bit more damage. Though typically this will be kept up by a dps warrior or something along those lines in a main tanking situation, if you're tanking a mob away from everyone else by yourself that's not the case.<br>
- Also despite having the same type of gear/avoidance that a warrior has, we don't have Thunder Clap. Which is also something that causes you to take more damage compared to a warrior (An exception would be a paladin with Thunderfury, but those are few and far between, and Thunderfury is a fairly significant threat downgrade).<br>
<br>
So typically when you compare each tank a paladin will take more damage over time than a warrior or druid. There's a few exceptions, e.g. on a fast attacking mob that does low damage per hit our higher blocking reliability can possibly mean we take less damage. Also obviously if we're talking about tanking a mob that's being debuffed with Thunder Clap and Demoralizing Shout by a warrior than damage taken will be comparable to that of a warrior.<br>
<br>
The debuffs are really the big reason, I'm personally a fan of giving Prot Paladins an attack speed debuff like Warriors, but make it weaker than Thunder Clap (15% as opposed to 20% or similar). But that's beside the point. That'd also mean that there's at least one other source than warriors for attack speed debuffs in raids (There's three separate sources for AP debuffs, but only Warriors for attack speed).</div>

		<div id="post_message_624364">Hm, usually I'm giving advice and not asking for one, but I'm a bit confused.<br>
Since the last patch I've noticed a massive loss of threat (~20%) and I can't really see why. I didn't change my specc and only switched a few items. At the moment the armory shows my avoidance gear (370ish spelldmg), my more paladin-ish gear set has something around 480 spelldmg, but it doesn't close that 20%-gap.<br>
<br>
I didn't change my rotation or anything so I feel really lost. The only really logical explanations that come to my mind would be<br>
a) Omen/Threat-1.0 shows wrong stuff (we had some problems with Omen in the last weeks) and I'm just too paranoid.<br>
b) Our warlocks and hunters just can't play, my threat is fine and I should let them die instead of feeling guilty.<br>
c) I'm way too stupid to press my 4 buttons.<br>
d) I'm bugged...<br>
<br>
Dunno whats happening here, but wandering from 1000 single target tps to 700-800 feeds me some very solid amount of confusion. Any ideas?<br>
<br>
PS: Just to say it again, I changed almost nothing - Battlemaster enchant on my mace has been there for a long time and I found it really worth it, especially due to the global threat in Hyjal and yet the missing of +40 spelldmg hasn't been an issue. Btw, as far as I can see from WWS, the Battlemaster proc seems to scale with spelldmg.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I'm posting here on behalf of our own prot paladin...<br>
<br>
I'm usually OTing along him during raids, but I recently healed 2 different ZA runs in a quick succession (Thursday and Friday). I noticed how much damage he was tanking on the bear boss versus how much damage the other 3 tanks I healed over those runs... Most of them have about the same general gear level, so that's not the problem.. He said he had a lot of problems with "hard-hitting" (or semi-hard, this is still the bear boss) mobs in general, and that he was always tanking a lot of damage.. He's not sure what he's doing wrong, or if he is doing anything wrong and we just have to get used to it and heal through it...<br>
<br>

<br>
The WWS is from Karathress, and we're killing the hunter + pet first (he tanks both)... over the course of the fight, I took as much damage as I did on the shaman, who died second... He knows I'm an avid reader of these boards and asked me to look for help...<br>
<br>
Keep in mind his AoE tanking is fine (or I'd think so, we haven't had any problems with it yet) and his threat output seems quite nice when I happen to be in cat, I'm looking at the problem from a pure mitigation perspective...<br>
<br>
Many thanks</div>

</div>Just chiming in on this guy -- his gear/spec don't really throw out any red flags.  His HP and avoidance are a <i>little</i> on the low side and he doesn't have BoK (which doesn't matter with other pallies in the raid), but nothing to really worry about.  As mentioned earlier, the raw spell damage gem choice is part of the problem.  It appears that he's focusing a bit too much on threat and not enough on survival with his gear choices; case in point would be the ruby serpent for a trinket instead of a more traditional tanking piece.  His cloak is an obvious choice to upgrade, but he probably knows that already.  He can use the badge chest item for a notable upgrade,  and even though he'll lose the 2-pc T4 bonus in doing so, he has plenty of spell damage on his gear as-is and his threat generation should still be ample for the content you're facing.  He shouldn't abandon his spell damage pieces entirely, but rather collect multiple gearsets to mix and match based on the current encounter (i.e. threat set for VR, survival set for FLK).<br>
<br>
EDIT: Have him go with the agility glove enchant over the spell damage enchant when survivability is a concern.<br>
<br>
As an aside, an often-overlooked stat when tanking multiple mobs and/or fast hitters is block value.  I'm personally around 460 damage shaved off per block in my survival gearset, which is huge on fast hitters like bear and lynx in ZA, or when tanking multiple targets like FLK's hunter and AoE packs on Morogrim and Solarian.</div>

		<div id="post_message_625014">Paladins take more damage than warriors or druids under most circumstances. This isn't the end of the world; they make up for this by being much harder to crush than warriors and taking less damage as their health drops further into the AD zone. And usually, they take less spiky damage than druids (no crushes) or warriors (less parry gibs/random crushes) so it ends up not being as much a problem.<br>
<br>
But it's a weakness of a paladin, and if you believe that damage intake is the be-all, end all of tanking they're the worst tanking class. Keep in mind that the difference is not a huge one regardless.</div>

</div>With 3 ZA items, I'm at about 580 blocking in my mob AOE tanking gear.  There was an analysis a few pages back on the relative importance of various tanking aspects; the comment was something to the effect that at high levels of blocking value it gets powerful.  I can vouch for this - the healers are commenting that I don't seem to take much damage, especially in AOE tanking situations and with rapid-hitting bosses (e.g Prince in Kara, Bear boss in ZA).<br>
<br>
The downsides to the ZA gear is a real struggle to stay at or above 490 defense (i've been re-gemming to <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=24062"><span><span class="bluename">[Enduring Talasite]</span></span></a> over <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=24033"><span><span class="bluename">[Solid Star of Elune]</span></span></a> - which negatively affects hit points), and a lower damage and healing level - I'm finding the odd thing is being pulled off me in AOE tanking situations, where before I'd have and keep them all.  The loss of threat is something I'm concerned about, but so far it has seemed manageable, especially considering how much the block value seems to have improved my survivability.<br>
<br>
I think... the ZA gear and block value gear in general... will have a permanent place in my various wardrobes.  I'd highly recommend investing a month or two and getting it all from ZA - with a 3 day reset window, it's only about 30/60 days (with leather/plate 2nd tank) to have more or less got everything, assuming you can find a similarly committed group of 9 other players.  My group's ZA runs are getting shorter as we get more experience/gear - I think they'll hit one and a half hours complete clear before we're done with the place, right now running about 2.5 hours.</div>

<br>
For Akhtal.  Tell you friend to come check out this thread.  I learned a lot here. (thanks guys/gals) He just needs to gear like a warrior when it comes to tanking hard hitting mobs/bosses.  There is a point when he gear is further improved, that things will swing for the better.  My pally used to be the same way.  Hit really freaking hard and seemed pointless to have me tank things. Few more upgrades here and there, I now have more mitigation and avoidance that the guild warriors.  This will change of course, at least I hope it does.  But.  He's on the right track and will get there soon enough.  I threw up my Armory if he'd like to check it out by all means.  Here is also a paladin I compare myself with time to time to see what gear I will be rolling on.   <br>

Overall, my thought is gear like a warrior slap on a spell damage weapon and holy shield/consecrate to death add a seal here and there  = Win\<br>

</div>I heard and seen this a lot.  Agility in the long run, imo, seems like wasted materials.  None, not a single piece of gear paladin do pick up has even one point of agility.  No tier piece has it.  No random trash loot from any 25 man raid has it.  Agility is just not a stat Paladins have the luxury of stacking.  15 agi  to gloves compared to 2% threat or 10 stam leather working kit.  Just doesn't compare.  This is also why a Warrior, who gets plenty of agi, would put agi on cloak. Where paladin should just go for the dodge it'll do more for your avoidance overall.  Until they decide to add more stats to Pally tier gear that is.  I wish they would change it. Until then, go with Stam or threat on them gloves don't waste mats.  OR  This is something I tend to do.  Get multiple sets of gear, if able of course,  Gem/chant them up in different fashions see what works best for you.  It is possible to stack agi i suppose proper use of gem slots and all that.  Heck as stated way in the beginning of this post.  Having gear for +spell damage and mobs tanking and gear for bosses isn't a bad idea,  For  mobs you do not need 490 defense so you get a little slack in the gear chioces.<br>
<br>
<br>
Overall Hardening up that shell, stack stamina, gem stamina. Find the right gear and you just get the avoidance you need.  Nothing better than having a prot warrior jealous at you for having more hp.  Which is quite a feat I have to add. enjoy</div>

</div>You don't need to stack agility for it to be useful.  15 agility is effectively 0.66% dodge, 33 armor, and a tiny amount of melee crit for a paladin after BoK.  Compare that to 126 hp gained from 10 stamina, and agility is going to come out ahead the vast majority of the time.  If they ever add a +dodge enchant for gloves I'll agree with you, but for now agility is king for glove enchants when it comes to survivability.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">"time till oom" is meaningless. The fight will last a certain duration regardless of how long you can last, and you want to maximize your threat during that time.<br>
<br>
If the fight is 5 minutes for example, wether you go oom in 2.5 minutes or 7 minutes doesn't matter. What matters is the amount of threat you put out, which depends on a lot more than just how fast you go oom. In fact, since starting mana is so insignificant, the amount of mana regened over those 5 minutes is much more significant than the starting mana.</div>

</div>Where on earth did I say this applied to all fights?  Where did I say that you needed your mana to last longer than the fight?  For that matter, where did I suggest that gearing up mp5 was even remotely a good idea?  You're engaging in a staggering degree of strawman-arguing and over-generalization.<br>
<br>
I'm talking about specific situations, such as:  1) Voidreaver, where you need to be able to put out threat for up to 2-3 minutes while OTing in between getting full mana refills from SA, and 2) Tanking Al'ar adds, where you need to be able to put out significant threat so that dps can open up quickly., despite the fact that you're not taking a lot of damage.<br>
<br>
In both of these cases, having a bit of intellect on your gear makes a non-trivial difference in the amount of time you can spend generating threat, and in fact buys you far more utility than you'd get from stacking exclusively spelldamage and relying only on your base ~3.5k mana pool.<br>

				You don't need to stack agility for it to be useful. 15 agility is effectively 0.66% dodge, 33 armor, and a tiny amount of melee crit for a paladin after BoK. Compare that to 126 hp gained from 10 stamina, and agility is going to come out ahead the vast majority of the time. If they ever add a +dodge enchant for gloves I'll agree with you, but for now agility is king for glove enchants when it comes to survivability.

</div><br>
I would agree with +dodge to gloves, Let's hope we see that in the future.  .66% to dodge is nothing compared to what actual dodge rating from gear would get you.  If you need the dodge that much find an item with dodge rating on it.  Horde paladins are short on HP, proven fact.  Use your gear to get our survivability where you need it, Use the gems and chants to A: ensure being uncrushable  B: stack hps.  In all honesty if you need .66% to dodge in order to help you survive what is your gear looking like?  <br>
<br>
33 armor?  really 33 armor I don't even wanna think about calculating what 33 armor gives you.  33 armor isn't gonna push you over to a new % of damage reduction, well I take that back it could, but really 33 armor.  <br>
<br>
And for melee crit.  yup melee crit.  If i had to rely on my weapon swings critting in order to help threat the raid would never dps.   <br>
<br>
Don't get me wrong.  I understand what you are saying.  It could indeed be very helpful if you happen to have heroic gear that has agi, str, and stam on them, hell throw that enchant on there.  Paladin Tier gear though......nothing.  It focuses on what is most important.  <br>
<br>
This of course is my opinion.  In the long run it all comes down to what you need most.  Being a Paladin you have the so many options available to you.  Sometimes you just have to think about getting two different set to accomplish one goal.  Raid boss you want avoidance throw that agi up there if it'll help ya out.  Aoe tanking spell damage or stam is the way to go.  or hell 2% base threat added to everything, I can't complain.</div>

		<div id="post_message_626436">0.66% dodge might sound insignificant, but if there were magically a 15 dodge rating enchant we could use instead, that would only add 0.79% dodge.  Toss in the 33 armor and the two would be very comparable.<br>
<br>
Also, I'm not talking about gear.  I'm talking about enchants.  Just because agility isn't an overly desirable stat to look for on gear doesn't mean we should rule it out when looking at enchants.<br>

		<div id="post_message_626628">I find that block value is very useful for a protadin, and probably our best source of mitigation against multiple mobs.<br>
<br>
For tanking trash in MH (which we have just started to do a week or so ago) I have about 580 block value.  Mobs hit for around 1k, so I am reducing the damage I take on a hit by a bit more than half and the damage is coming in quite steadily without bursts.  In tier 5 and 6 instances it wouldn't be all that hard to raise this block value to the 700 area or beyond.<br>
<br>
I have an avoidance set as well, which has something like 12% more dodge, parry and miss than my aoe set but only about 340 block value and a lot less spell damage since it's made from "random" tank gear rather than T5.  When taking a lot of small hits, even this difference in avoidance is made up for by the block value in terms of overall damage incoming.  I'm not sure how it would stack up to compare tier 5 and 6 for aoe tanking, since tier 6 is almost entirely dodge/parry rather than block.  Apparently, T6 is for tanking heavy hitters and T5 is for Hyjal.<br>
<br>
In any case, my block set gives me a lot more threat than the dodge one would, at least until I get t6, so it makes life easier for the dps.  The simple fact that I've blocked an attack means I've hit the mob with a couple of hundred damage - and much more than that in threat.<br>
<br>
The decision on whether to wear the block or avoidance set is based on how hard I'm likely to be hit.  If a mob is hitting me for more than about 2k at a time then block starts to look less attractive I think.  That tends to mean that I wear my block set most of the time, since most of the time I'll be tanking a fast hitter or multiple mobs, and other tanks will have the big stuff.<br>
<br>
I do think it makes sense to go for an all or nothing approach to block value.  After all, we don't get extra threat from it or anything like that.  Its only function for us is mitigation.  If you are tanking a mob that hits for 8k then you want to 1% more dodge, not 50 block value (or whatever the relative item cost is), so there is no point wasting a single item point on block value.  On the other hand you quite often get mobs that hit for less than your block value, and they take damage when you block, so why would you want to dodge or parry?</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Hm, usually I'm giving advice and not asking for one, but I'm a bit confused.<br>
Since the last patch I've noticed a massive loss of threat (~20%) and I can't really see why. I didn't change my specc and only switched a few items. At the moment the armory shows my avoidance gear (370ish spelldmg), my more paladin-ish gear set has something around 480 spelldmg, but it doesn't close that 20%-gap.<br>
<br>
I didn't change my rotation or anything so I feel really lost. The only really logical explanations that come to my mind would be<br>
a) Omen/Threat-1.0 shows wrong stuff (we had some problems with Omen in the last weeks) and I'm just too paranoid.<br>
b) Our warlocks and hunters just can't play, my threat is fine and I should let them die instead of feeling guilty.<br>
c) I'm way too stupid to press my 4 buttons.<br>
d) I'm bugged...<br>
<br>
Dunno whats happening here, but wandering from 1000 single target tps to 700-800 feeds me some very solid amount of confusion. Any ideas?<br>
<br>
PS: Just to say it again, I changed almost nothing - Battlemaster enchant on my mace has been there for a long time and I found it really worth it, especially due to the global threat in Hyjal and yet the missing of +40 spelldmg hasn't been an issue. Btw, as far as I can see from WWS, the Battlemaster proc seems to scale with spelldmg.</div>

</div>The big 'gotcha' with +damage as opposed to 2% threat is a fairly significant amount of our threat comes from SA returns, as well as the seal/reseal mechanic, and the calculations I've run myself seem to back them up.   2% threat is a not insignifcant amount while dealing with threat capped DPS (because of the 100/110/130), so I'm pretty happy with my choice.<br>
<br>
And now I just remembered my gorefiend gloves are unenchanted.  D'oh.</div>

</div>The only thing I can think of that he could possibly mean is that for a Horde Paladin health would be lower compared to what a Tauren Warrior or a Druid would have (Because of the Tauren racial), while for Alliance Paladins there are no serious racial differences in health between any tank race/class combination beyond the base health differences.<br>
<br>
I can honestly say in practice that it isn't that big a deal. While 5% health is quite a bit with current health values, having 5% less health doesn't make you all that much weaker, especially considering not all Horde Warriors in the world are Tauren.<br>
<br>
More on the subject of enchants, on gloves Threat is basically the best threat enchant you can get. Even if we make a high assumption of the TPS gain from spellpower so it's 15 TPS, you'll be outdoing the threat that gives with a threat enchant as long as you do at least 750 TPS, and I can't remember being at a gear level at which I did less than 800ish TPS on a single target. For AoE tanking the crossover point is when your consecration does ~120 damage per tick. Of course I still have spell power on my gloves, but that's more because I still need to re-enchant them with threat; I originally had them enchanted with spell power as they were my grinding gloves as well.<br>
<br>
For survivability, it's basically a case of 11.66 stamina, versus 0.66% dodge and 33 armor, versus 240 armor (Or 264 if it works with Toughness).</div>

</div>Thanks for the correction on Slow.<br>
<br>
Hurricane certainly is of limited use in general situations, but for the specific use of quelling a periodic enrage, or easing a phase transition, I think it would be quite useful. Hurricane is actually a greater reduction than Improved Thunderclap, so in an infinite mana situation with zero DPS concerns it's worth using every cooldown anyway.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Our old main tank is on extended hiatus, and I'm going prot on raids these days.  It's looking possible that I'll tank Illidan this week, and had a couple questions.<br>
<br>
I heard once that shear cannot miss, so you need to gear such that you have 102.4 avoidance without factoring in miss rate.  Is this correct?   And assuming I do get screwed by the lag gap between holy shields, can you divine shield shear off?  Thanks.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">The big 'gotcha' with +damage as opposed to 2% threat is a fairly significant amount of our threat comes from SA returns, as well as the seal/reseal mechanic, and the calculations I've run myself seem to back them up.   2% threat is a not insignifcant amount while dealing with threat capped DPS (because of the 100/110/130), so I'm pretty happy with my choice.<br>

This is the Tankadin Gear Calculator. Not a Keylogger.<br>

This is a interactive database listing every single possible item you could want to use to tank with. It then calculates your end stats, avoidance, and even threat. Still under development; this is first release and would really appreciate some people testing it out to iron out all the issues.<br>
You can socket gems, enchant items, calculate buffs on yourself.<br>
Basically this is a help to all those struggling to work out if a certain upgrade will leave them Crushable, to see wether its worth the Gold spent on one belt compared to the badges for another...<br>

This requires Excel 2007 to work fully. The gem socketting fuctionality will not work completely with 2003, but i will work on a downgraded version.<br>

That looks like a <i>really</i> nice tool you are developing. I just spent half my lunch break playing with it and I was impressed. However, I did see a few shortcomings/issues which I want to examine:<br>
<br>
(1) In the gear selection, you seem to have hard-coded values for the Agility -&gt; Dodge conversion (and the other rating conversions too). Do you account for Blessing of Kings anywhere? BoK can make up a good bit of uncrushability; I'm just trying to figure out where it is accounted for.<br>
<br>
(2) Similarly, you have full talent trees implemented, but you seem to have 30% block (for Holy Shield) hard coded into your avoidance tally. You should probably change this to support the talent tree, ie, check to see if Holy Shield is selected. (This can help non-prot pallies determine if they can viably tank stuff - like heroics, for example.)<br>
<br>
(3) In the talent trees, if you have any talents there just for show (IE, you don't implement them), I would indicate that in some way. (They are still helpful for people building their talent trees, but people should realize that the talents won't "work".) In various other sheets, I've seen <b>implemented </b>talents in bold and <i>unimplemented </i>ones in unbolded typeface, but in italics.<br>
<br>
(4) Is there support for downranking spells? Will there be?<br>
<br>
(5) Similarly, maybe you could implement an option for incoming damage, compare that to the healing needed to sustain a rotation, and run an OOM calculation. (Or is this there somewhere and I'm missing it?)<br>
<br>
Overall, it looks really nice. I'll definitely be playing with it more.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_630007"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hello, figured this was a decently appropriate thread. Quick question: Is the damage reflected by a shield spike (Iron, Mithril, Felsteel, etc), affected by armor? I don't have any spikes, anywhere, ingame, or craftable by anyone I know, or on the AH, to test.<br>
<br>
Edit- Got a crafter, tested, and they are not affected by armor. (But they are affected by defensive stance penalty in an odd way)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

@ Left<br>
<br>
1), 2). Good idea. The Agi-&gt; Dodge is correctly calculated on the actual Character sheet, but the individual gear pieces only show agi/25. I'll update this in the next release. Same with Holy Shield, though the reason this was not fully implemented is simply that I expect anyone using the calculator to spec into HS.<br>
<br>
<br>
(3) In the talent trees, if you have any talents there just for show (IE, you don't implement them), I would indicate that in some way. (They are still helpful for people building their talent trees, but people should realize that the talents won't "work".) In various other sheets, I've seen <b>implemented </b>talents in bold and <i>unimplemented </i>ones in unbolded typeface, but in italics.<br>
<br>
4) Downranking was not implemented for first release as the coefficient changes for lower ranks were a little difficult to implement (still not sure if even the highest rank of SoR is correct, let alone lower ranks, for example). I have worked out how to code this though and will look at it in future.<br>
<br>
5) There should be a box in the top right of the Threat tab showing the healing needed per second to sustain your mana usage, and also the threat generated from Spiritual Attunement.<br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks for replying, it seems that the requirement to have excel 2007 is a bit much for some people but it was the only way to implement Gems the way I wanted to .<br>
Any more feedback much appreciated.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Right, I saw that. It is definitely helpful in some ways. However, in practice you can't control your incoming DPS, but you <i>can</i> control your mana usage. Thus, currently all that figure is telling you is the minimum fight where you can go all-out on threat without going OOM, rather than helping to chart a course for not going OOM at lower incoming DPS levels.<br>
<br>
I'll keep playing with it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I think noone answered yet.<br>
<br>
You need 101.8% without miss to be immune to shear which is fairly managable. As for lag delays: If it looks like it could happen that shear will occur just at the end of your HS-cooldown, just wait 2-4 seconds. I'm not sure about DS since I can't think of any person who would do this. It's risky, even with a cancelaura macro.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Im the typical 0/49/12 tank build. i understand that SoR scales with SpDmg...where as SoC scales with AP. when AoE multi mob grinding isnt an option... how best can a prot pally do DPS? If i was to move 1pt into Command...get myself a big slow 2hander and ret type gear would i do more dmg (single target) Or should i stay as is, stack Sp Dmg with a one hander + shield and just keep judging ?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Mana Burning mobs are just going to be a pain though. But typically for soloing I use consecration rank 3 in addition to my other gear. I have ~750 spell damage in the gear I use when soloing which makes that rank of consecration cause 100 damage per tick. I (mostly) use my healing gear set for soloing as well, the mana/5 on it is very nice to have, it means I may not kill fast, but at least I can keep it up for a while.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_636764"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I was wondering if you could help me out... having taken a break from raiding for a while, and only having the time now to raid on the occasional evening, I'm looking forward to the removal of BT/Hyjal attunements, and trying to get my tanking gear up to snuff for a bit of offtanking.<br>
<br>
I'm gathering a lot of Badges, and trying to figure out which items represent the best upgrades for me. I already have the BP, and am trying to figure out which other items represent the best upgrade over my current gear, taking badge cost into account. <br>
<br>
A lot of the badge gear seems to be dropping Defence and avoidance stats for Stamina and Expertise, and I'm obviously keen to stay uncrittable and uncrushable, preferably while being able to wear the new 2.4 +57 Sta trinket, and the Furies Deck card, rather than leaning on the Figurine of the Collossus. I'm also not sure just how good Expertise is for a paladin.. only really increasing threat from white + SoR damage, plus even taking Reckoning into account, we throw fewer melee hits at a mob to be potentially parry-gibbed.<br>
<br>
With that in mind, what priority should I give the badge upgrades? (Though I'll hang onto my badges awhile to see if this mythical t6 badge gear vendor ever appears)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I'm not a Prot paladin, but a tanking druid, and that new Commendation trinket makes me drool just thinking about it.  If the fight is not very agro sensitive, the proc from the Furies deck is next to pointless.  I'd use the new trinket over Furies 100% of the time as a Feral Druid.  That is a significant amount of dodge rating, and 35% is a number you'll see fairly frequently on heavier hitting bosses.<br>
<br>
Also, I forgot to mention, that + Ardent Defender is a really nice combo for when you dip low.  Pretty much any and all tanks should get this trinket as soon as possible.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_638777"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The Commendation is simply one of the best tanking trinkets out there. It's better than any of the stamina trinkets, and while it doesn't have the manual control of a normal avoidance trinket (Which can be handy at times), the benefit of having a server-side addition of 20% extra dodge when you drop below 35% health is simply amazing.<br>
<br>
The darkmoon card doesn't even compare. The threat boost from it isn't that big; I'd say the threat boost has never been the reason to use the darkmoon card anyway.<br>

I poked through this thread a bit trying to find a post about a spell damage goal for tanking off various tiers of DPSers, and couldn't find anything. E.g. t4: Recommend __ - __ spell damage, t5: Recommend __ - __ spell damage, etc. I felt like I was really hitting a wall back when I was playing my tankadin, as I had to slot for pure stam to survive against 2.0/2.1 SSC/TK trash, and I really had no chance of surviving the hits unless I put on the offset kara warrior gear for raw avoidance and stam over the spell damage of prot t4. I felt like I was having to make a choice between appropriate threat generation and the ability to survive, and I never was even satisfied with either side no matter how I stacked my gear. Eventually I realized I was not measuring up to the bulls and bears, and rather than go holy simply stopped raiding.<br>
 <br>
Fast forward a few months, I reroll a resto shaman to be able to catch up with my guild in t6 content. Now I'm seeing dozens of prot pallies with obscene gear. 4/5 t6, the helm off illidan, bulwark, ToC main hand. Clearly there are people out there making it work, and I can't help but think I was just doing it wrong. DId I make a mistake stacking solid stars in my gear? Should I have bid on more of the tier gear and gotten 4/5 t4? I miss tanking really bad and I really want my assumptions on tankadin viability to be wrong, even though it's probably too late for me to get caught up in gear enough to tank in BC cutting edge content.<br>

Ultimately how you play the game is up to you.  If your guild really needs the resto shaman, then id suggest taking that route if raiding is your main form of fun.  On the other hand if being a tank and making it work is how you have fun, and your guild is ok with your choice, then by all means go for it.  Paladins have tanked everything in the game including Illidan, so the class as a whole has definitely made immense progress.  <br>

</div>The period when you're just coming into SSC/TK is like hitting puberty.  It's not pretty.  Druids have massive healthpoints at that level, and kara plate gear is aimed at tanking warriors or healing paladins.  There's no decent weapon that drops in kara.  It's basically a miserable time.  The only even halfway decent tanking weapon upgrades till Mt. Hyjal are Leo's sword, and well that's it.  Especially Pre-2.3, our hp was crap, our available gear was decent at best, and people weren't used to us tanking which made it all the more difficult.  Now, badge loot can effectively gear up your chest, legs, wrist, cape, boots and belt(? don't remember) to T5 levels, with spell damage on the chest, boots and belt(?).  Still hosed for a weapon, not really sure why Blizzard hates us itemization-wise on that, but can get enough warriorish gear to flask/food/weapon oil the necessary spell damage.<br>
<br>
As for levels, I did ok with ~300-350 in T5 content, and am perfectly happy with ~450/500 in the beginning of T6 content.<br>
<br>
Specifically, grab some of the badge gear.  If you're exalted with LC, get <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30832" target="_blank">[Gavel of Unearthed Secrets]</a>, or do arena for the season 2 mace.  Keep gemming solid stars, and build your avoidance stats as best you can.  Part of the hard work is altering perception.  There are a lot of people who discount a prot pally as even being good to tank.  Once people figure out your strengths and weaknesses and play to them, your life will get a lot easier.<br>
<br>
Anyway, best of luck.  For me at least, tanking has definitely been worth the trouble getting here.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Like I said, it's probably too late for me to try to gear from t4 up to BT/Hyjal tankadin gear - my guild has three t6-decked prot warriors and two equally decked ferals, and I doubt any competant guild would want to take on such a charity case. But I do miss it enough to start shooting for some of that yummy badge gear, and grab at least a s1 hammer for a 70 spell damage upgrade over continuum.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_639764"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Chicken, there's a big difference between a guild who's just killed Kael, in mostly t5 with some t4 (I'm the inverse of that), and a guild that's been farming t6 for months. I don't have the spell damage to hold aggro off AoE-ers with 1300 spell damage, and my low gear level would force the healers to work pretty hard; it's most likely I'd just go tits up on nearly every pull. There's also that small issue of getting Hyjal attuned. This probably sounds like whining; I don't mean for it to, I'm just saying that it's very unlikely I'll be able to pull up to my guild's content, especially since they do not value prot paladins. Hell, look at Gurg's comment in the 2.4 PTR thread: "paladins are still garbage." <b>[Edit:] I actually PM'd Gurg about this, and he was making a joke on Dares' guildname. He values both prot and holy paladins greatly in any cutting-edge content raid.</b><br>
 <br>
Emily, we don't run ZA anymore. There's been zero healer interest since about a month after 2.3 hit. Most of our shamans and pallies have the mp5 trinket off Malacrass anyway, and typically log on and off their mains about five minutes before and after raids (myself included). The alts also don't have the gear to handle ZA, so the only off-night instance we run is Kara. I suppose I should probably make some friends in t5-level guilds and try to hit up some ZAs.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Not true if you can just get a badge piece or two and farm up a better weapon.  In Hyjal you use spell damage food, adept's elixir and superior wizard oil, and have the group constructed so you have a shaman for wrath of air.  If you're north of 500-550 spell damage after that, you can hold aggro sufficiently well even off T6 AOE.<br>
<br>
The survivability issue isn't really one, as long as your other tanks are getting Aboms off you.  Having said that, make sure to have several stacks of Free Action potions and don't be shy about using them on Abom pulls if they're going to be sticking to you.<br>

</div>You're right, it does sound like whining. There are plenty of people in this thread telling you that they made Hyjal work at a ~T4/badge gear level - and having geared healers is only going to increase your survivability. You've been presented with a multitude of ways to increase your viability for this job - farm the arena gavel, use threat consumables, get the badge gear - and that's really all it takes.<br>
<br>
If your guild is simply unwilling to try you out in this slot or let you switch main characters, you have a guild problem, not a paladin tanking problem.

</div>Ya, I mean Bryne comes across harsh there, but he's right.  The gear and paladin talents have gotten substantially better since the last time you tried tanking.  Badge and ZA gear is awesomesauce, and even without ZA, badge gear alone will get you to a pretty decent place.<br>
<br>
As for Hyjal trash, you're going to be doing a lot more average threat per mob than whomever you have tanking it at the moment.  Even with 300 spell damage against T6 tanks.  Things going in your favor: It's undead (mmm Holy Wrath and exorcism), there's a lot of mobs coming from one spot( yay consecration ), and CC is limited to a few shackles and sheep at best.<br>
<br>
Getting into Hyjal is a different story, but even then you're still pretty useful.  Al'ar and Solarian are definitely easier with a prot pally.  Same with KT and the weapons/phoenixes.  In SSC, Leo/TW, Vashj, and if you have the resist gear Hydross are all made slightly easier with a prot pally (much easier for TW ).  Getting into runs might be hard, but you may be able to convince a guild that's just one Vashj or KT to bring you along in return for you valuable insight to those fights.<br>
<br>
Anyway, if you don't really want to tank, then that's a different issue.  But if you're committed, you can definitely find a way to get it done.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

So I try to offload as much holy damage as possible without 'taunting'.  If I start with Avengine Wrath...

There is 450 spell damage, from never setting foot into a single raid.  I typically tank Hyjal with no consumables, and have typically ran around 500-530 spell damage. And I haven't had issue holding aggro except against focused single target attacks, which I can just taunt anyways.<br>

</div>Same deal, but while maintaining secondary aggro, putting up JotC is incredibly important, and you have no excuse for not putting it up immediately.<br>

Consecration is mandatory while maintaining secondary aggro as well.  If you can not consecrate due to CC, move the target.  There will be no way, unless your DPS is very terrible, that you will keep up with secondary threat if you can't consecrate.<br>

		<div id="post_message_639939"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->As Zedrich pointed out, spelldamage consumables can provide quite a bit of threat on their own.<br>
<br>
Also, as mentioned earlier in the thread, Stratholme Holy Water can provide a huge burst of instant AoE threat.  What makes it great is that (a) it scales with spelldamage gear, (b) it's holy damage so gets the RF threat multiplier, and (c) it can crit.  You'd have to farm up a ton of it if you want to use it for every pull (although you could do it, since it has a 1-minute cooldown), but if you alternate holy water with AW on pulls, you should be able to use one or the other every time.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Good day,<br>
<br>
I recently respecced Protection from Holy due to a lack of tanks for a few weeks and that the current Paladin Tank is actually an alt of a mage and he is being asked to run with his mage as it normally out-dpses better geared mages all te time.<br>
<br>
The MT in my guild is continuously banging the OT drum.  He wants me to practice OTing as opposed to  MTing Karazhan (for example).  He says I need to master being able to keep up threat generation to complement the MT.  I haven't studied strats for BT/MH but the only times I have seen a requirement for an OT is when we do Gruul (and we don't do that anymore hence I am still wearing Kara warrior shoulders )<br>
<br>
I have tried to OT trash just to try and keep up with the warrior tanking the add (the robot pairs in TK on the way to VR or Solarian for example).  So I try to offload as much holy damage as possible without 'taunting'.  If I start with Avengine Wrath... I have a better chance at keeping up, but I am OTing on an add/boss that isn't hitting me, so no HS hits, and not taking enough damage to re-gain back mana from SA.<br>
<br>
When I single target trash tank, or MT in Kara, I normally:<br>
1- Prep HS<br>
2- Put up SoR<br>
3- Pull using AS (if I can without messing up the pull for the other tanks) or JoR (and reload SoR immediately)<br>
4- Pull mob back out of range of CC and consecrate<br>
5- HS again... Jor-&gt;SoR -&gt; consecrate (throw in an Exorcism or AS if I have cool down time)<br>
<br>
Some times I'll use AW at the start... depends if I remember <br>
<br>
For OTing...<br>
1- SoR<br>
2- JoR - SoR<br>
3 - Consecrate (if no CC around)<br>
4 - AS (if no CC around)<br>
<br>
Repeat...  (Sometimes I hit AW to try and stay up with the MT)<br>
<br>
I am really noob to tanking, this post and others at maintankadin have helped me figure out a great many thing.  My armory is linked in my sig block, be gentle </div>

<br>
I personally feel your MT is off the mark by asking you to OT Kara with the gear you have and the fact that you're working T5 content.  Ultimately, your threat generation suffers a LOT by not getting attacked, so it's not realistic to expect that you'll be able to match his threat generation.  Threat from Holy Shield + Retribution Aura + Thorns (etc) is non-trivial, and contributes a good chunk of threat along with receiving SA mana gains for you to sustain it.  And besides, you don't need to match him, you need to provide "enough" threat for DPS to unload while not being a burden on your healing core.  Your spell rotation looks fine, and your gear has ample spelldamage for the content you're up against.  If anything, I'd say you might have too much spell damage given where your max HP is at.<br>
<br>
On top of that, you're going to get more practice with the added stress of knowing that if you screw up a DPS will pull aggro -- sometimes it's good to have that pressure to keep you with your A game rather than just doing enough to get by.  The best way to get you into the mix is to start you off as OT for a bit, then once you're comfortable with that take the reins for a bit as MT.  Kara is a perfect place for that when you're in a guild at your progression level.  Personally, the past few weeks we've only run Kara with 1 tank-specced person (me), and we just have a fury warrior put on tank gear for the very few spots you actually need 2 tanks.  It's worked incredibly well, and I'm sure a feral druid would do even better in this situation.<br>

</div>This quote is in regard to spell rotation on trash pulls, and in most cases I completely disagree.  JoR right off the bat gives you a solid chunk of threat and virtually eliminates DPS pulling aggro with a string of early (un)lucky crits.  Most trash mobs don't live long enough for the added threat from JotC to matter.  If your target is #2 or later to be killed, the <i>only</i> thing that matters is initial threat, because by the time the first mob dies you should have enough threat for you to go AFK if you wanted.  And JoR is especially critical in scenarios with CC'd mobs, since Consecration becomes a double-edged sword (admittedly though, you shouldn't be tanking the 1st DPS target in these cases because overall threat generation suffers greatly).  I used to be an advocate of JotC on trash, but it's gotten me into too much trouble to continue using it.  I've lost threat too many times on targets that changed directions after I judged JotC because a warrior popped Bloodrage before the pull and a tick of +1 rage put him above my 0 threat.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Well, our guild is pushing 5/6 SSC and 3/4 TK hoping to at least down Vash and Kael just to say we did it, and do it before 2.4   We're a casual raiding guild so our progression isn't as accelerated as others.<br>
<br>
I tank Kara with an arms/fury Warrior or Druid Bear OT too, been doing Kara since April and I continue to do it for badges.  I like tanking it, it's fun and relatively easy instance to do it with my gear.  And OTing VR... did that a week ago... my AS hit VR just before the MT hit it... ops .  So I ended up staying on top of the meter until he was dead... FUN!... then we did Gruul... I wasn't the OT, but I was expected to maintain threat (like I did on VR), I am thinking so they can say: 'See? It's not as easy at it looks!'... Of course, I wasn't able to keep up with the DPS.<br>

		<div id="post_message_640053"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->A quick note on Paladin tanking auras since I didn't see it posted anywhere else, and it's a question that's come up.<br>
<br>
Retribution aura is ideal for multi-mob tanking for an agro boost where you're not at a high risk of death, especially for really large aoe groups like the murloc packs on Morogrim.<br>
<br>
Devotion is the way to go for single target boss tanking, even though the armor benefit reduction is only around 1-2% depending on your current armor it still adds up over the course of the fight.<br>
<br>
Obviously resistance auras are the natural choice where applicable.<br>
<br>
Concentration can be very nice if you happen to have casters, especially healers in your group where a relatively constant aoe source is going to effect their casting ie. Netherspite or Vashj, since them getting the heals off timely will be far more valuable than other factors auras might provide.<br>
<br>
Crusader aura, it's kind of like leaving a riding crop on for the whole group, funny at first but people are just gonna laugh at you.<br>
<br>
Sanctity is far too deep into the Ret tree to really be specced for without leaving major holes in your protection, but on the off chance your guild raids with both a Ret pally and a Prot pally the two of you should be inseparable.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yes, I apologize for seeming so mopey. I had enough people I respected telling me "Pally tanks are worthless in t5 content and beyond" that I bought it, and it sapped my enthusiasm. To quote our MT: "I will give every one of our DPS warriors a full set of prot gear before throwing any to a pally." I held these assumptions up until very recently starting to armory various high-end pallies and finding them quite decked in t6-level prot gear, and now I'm kind of bummed that I gave up when I hit the t5 wall. But to be clear, I've been highly motivated by this thread to make it happen. <div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px; ">

				<div style="font-style:italic">This quote is in regard to spell rotation on trash pulls, and in most cases I completely disagree.  JoR right off the bat gives you a solid chunk of threat and virtually eliminates DPS pulling aggro with a string of early (un)lucky crits.

If your target is #2 or later to be killed, the <i>only</i> thing that matters is initial threat, because by the time the first mob dies you should have enough threat for you to go AFK if you wanted.  And JoR is especially critical in scenarios with CC'd mobs, since Consecration becomes a double-edged sword (admittedly though, you shouldn't be tanking the 1st DPS target in these cases because overall threat generation suffers greatly).  I used to be an advocate of JotC on trash, but it's gotten me into too much trouble to continue using it.  I've lost threat too many times on targets that changed directions after I judged JotC because a warrior popped Bloodrage before the pull and a tick of +1 rage put him above my 0 threat.</div>

</div>Well the situation quoted was OT'ing one of those Crystalcore Devastators in TK.  I'd absolutely want to JoTC first, then pop AW and have at it.<br>
<br>
However most of the time I agree.  If the expected life of a trash mob is very short, it's not worth judging Crusader, and I view judging Righteousness as analogous to our "Shield Slam" -- snap aggro move.   I guess this also depends if it's a pull you can use AS on.  If I can use AS and then Consecrate, I'm much more likely to judge Crusader.  If I can do neither then I'm judging Righteousness and I'll get Crusader up on the next Judgement cooldown.</div>

</div>I think this will be a great meta gem for pallies, especially once you start to get a nice high block value.<br>
<br>
Question I'm wondering on it is it 10% off the top, or 10% onto your base block value.<br>
<br>
Shield specialization gives 30%<br>
So say your natural block value is 300 (which is reasonable for SSC/TK) would give you 390bv with talents.<br>
<br>
So is this extra 10% making it 10% more than the 390, or the 300?<br>
<br>
300*(.3+.1) = 120bv total<br>
390*.1 = 129bv total<br>
<br>
So in this example it's an extra 30 or 39 block value.<br>
<br>
Especially for fast hitting mobs, blocking an extra 30 damage per swing will add up pretty quick, and with health pools around 22k+ with buffs for an SSC/TK gear level this might be the spot to shave off a few hit points for survival.</div>

</div>A mob only has to live something like 8 seconds before the threat from JotC catches up due to Holy Shield, Consecration, SoR, and eventually another JoR, and like I said earlier, if you need snap aggro on the mob, judge JoR first.  If the mob's at 30% health before you can do a second judgement, quite obviously you wouldn't put up JotC.  But in a large majority of circumstances, JotC is useful.  Being a second tank, I would always put up JotC because it just gives such a significant threat bonus. <br>
<br>
I can put out 1100 or so TPS on trash, and DPS still has to somewhat limit themselves to avoid pulling aggro on occasion.  But even so, this question was not about me, it was about the fellow who was having a hard time holding aggro.<br>
<br>
If you lost aggro to the warrior due to bloodrage you're doing it wrong.  As I said, you can make a macro that immediately seals righteousness.  Melee hits with the seal is going to get you aggro.  Sealing gives you some threat.  If you need more than that, then yes, judge righteousness first.  Hell, the warrior has to hit it to get any appreciable threat, so should you.  But like I said, if you have to absolutely guarantee you get aggro off the bat, judge righteousness and pray that you don't get a resist. (JotC can not be resisted, JoR has a 13% chance with precision)<br>
<br>
Consecration can almost always be used.  You're the tank, so 99% of the time, you control where the mob is positioned.  Move it away from the CC, and then consecrate. You're not going to generate much threat at all if you're just using SoR/JoR/Holy Shield without even judging crusader.<br>
<br>
I see by your gear that you're mostly in ten man and tier 4 content.  So maybe that's where we have a disconnect.  Scaling gear up you get very marginal gains in terms of spell damage for the prot paladin, while DPS potential of your DPS classes skyrocket. When I started to notice that my threat wasn't pulling it's weight, the first, and most effective change I made was to start using JotC again.  Now someone at a different level than myself is having an issue with threat, and so I'm just giving the same advice I used myself.<br>
<br>
Use consecration even if there is CC in the pull, do it by moving the pull out of consecration range of the target.  <br>
JotC gives increased TPS at a decreased initial burst threat value.  This is typically fine because most classes have some amount of ramp-up time as they build rage/CP/debuffs/sunder etc.  If you need to secure initial threat, you can still judge righteousness first, but JotC gives great longer term benefit.</div>

</div>Really depends on why you even want to be uncrushable.  A lot of people work really hard for this, despite the fact that they're typically running as offtanks or secondary tanks.<br>
<br>
If you're tanking in 25 mans, and plan on tanking bosses, then you can assume you will have every class's buffs, so ensure you're uncrushable buffed.<br>
<br>
If you're tanking in 25 mans, but primarily trash tanking or offtanking boss adds like embers of al'ar, coilfang guardians, murlocs, which aren't even 73+ don't even worry about being uncrushable.<br>
<br>
If you're tanking 10 mans, and plan on tanking bosses, then ensure you're uncrushable even without buffs, because some classes might not even be there.</div>

</div>In my opinion it is fine to rely on buffs as long as you are sure you are getting them. My pally alt always runs with a druid every Kara run (usually 2 or 3 of them), so I factor Kings + Mark into my uncrushable calculation.<br>
<br>
Alternatively, if you are worried about it, grab yourself an alternate trinket for more avoidance, check your avoidance prior to every boss fight using the macro in the first post of the thread, and adjust your trinket prior to the fight if you have to make it up. Also, realize that for dual-wielding bosses you can afford to drop some avoidance, as their miss rates are higher.</div>

</div>You should always have Kings (self-buff) and the elixir/flask/etc buffs, so definitely count those.  Otherwise, like others have said, don't worry about it.  Make your gear the best possible and you'll be ready for with-buffs or just slightly less ready for without buffs.  Unlikely that anyplace where you wouldn't expect every buff it'll be the make or break difference.</div>

		<div id="post_message_640391">Hi there, this is my first time posting here since I'm mainly ret in raids (you'll find me on the EJ ret forum a lot ) and only occasionally go prot or holy these days.<br>
<br>
Still, I've managed to tank all trash in Hyjal, MT the first 3 bosses in Hyjal and some random bosses/trash in BT, including Sharhraz/Council rogue/Illidan flame adds/MT Illidan amongst others and until now my usual theory has been "if it doesn't kill me and I can keep aggro, I'm doing fine" (besides all the basic crit/crush immunity etc) vs ret theory where it's about point by point damage improvement.<br>
<br>
However recently I'd like to nail down some things I'm not too sure of and optimize as much as I can, this is where this thread comes in. Anyway, I digress, just to explain my background for the relevant info. <br>
<br>
I think I'm well versed about the mitigation/avoidance stuff (had a warrior alt pre-TBC which tanked up to 10 bosses in Naxx), my questions are mainly all about maximising threat further.<br>
<br>
<b>1. SoR vs SoV:</b><br>
<br>
I know SoV can have some debuff upkeep issues (which are minimized by the new extra long duration last patch), but simply put: Over a 10 min fight where you can keep SoV stacks up (no phases where you can't hit the boss like illidan), which provides more threat? SoR or SoV? And at which spelldamage level is SoR/SoV better?<br>
<br>
Unbuffed, I'm currently at 528 spelldamage with 2% threat on gloves (my armory profile should show my tanking gear atm).<br>
<br>
I usually start off with SoR to gain some good aggro, before I start stacking SoV and then switch to that, other times I just stick to SoR all fight, I'd like to know which is better (at 528 spelldamage unbuffed), especially since they improved SoV now (with holy damage when fully stacked from the seal hits).<br>

<b>2. 1h spec vs Reckoning:</b><br>
<br>
This is my usual prot spec: <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?talent=sZVhtIx0dgMqtVbx" target="_blank">Talent Calculator - World of Warcraft</a><br>
<br>
While this is a pretty solid spec, I've been considering getting 1h spec over reckoning.<br>
<br>
What's the general agreed on norm here? Which causes more threat when tanking a boss with no adds? Does reckoning proc when you parry? Or only block/hit?<br>
<br>
I also have 4 piece T6 bonus (+10% damage/threat from consecration) so that should tilt things slightly more in favor of 1h spec.<br>
<br>
What do people advise? Or is there a spec that makes sense which has both without losing too much other stuff? (Dropping Ardent Defender maybe? Not sure)<br>

<b>3. Windfury vs Wrath of Air (101 spelldamage) totem:</b><br>
<br>
Normally I ask for Wrath of Air, but have been considering Windfury as an alternative. Anyone done research on this? Do the extra procs + seal procs outweigh the added threat from WoA totem or is it not worth it?<br>
<br>
Considering prot paladins don't have as many synergies as prot warriors to increase threat (feral druid/battle shout is worthless to us), is there any other party synergies that can be recommended besides Shaman/Ret pala? (SP misery in raid, but not in party)<br>

</div>Not to sound like a jerk, but who cares if you get a significant threat bonus on the target that DPS isn't focusing on?  All you need to do is outpace the healers, which SoR alone should do.  By the time the first target dies you should have a commanding threat lead and it really doesn't matter much what you do.  Seems to me JoW would be better to put up after you have an ample threat lead on the healers (2nd judgement, basically).  That way your DPS can get a little mana back when they switch to your target. <br>

				If you lost aggro to the warrior due to bloodrage you're doing it wrong.  As I said, you can make a macro that immediately seals righteousness.  Melee hits with the seal is going to get you aggro.  Sealing gives you some threat.  If you need more than that, then yes, judge righteousness first.  Hell, the warrior has to hit it to get any appreciable threat, so should you.  But like I said, if you have to absolutely guarantee you get aggro off the bat, judge righteousness and pray that you don't get a resist. (JotC can not be resisted, JoR has a 13% chance with precision<br>
<br>
Consecration can almost always be used.  You're the tank, so 99% of the time, you control where the mob is positioned.  Move it away from the CC, and then consecrate. You're not going to generate much threat at all if you're just using SoR/JoR/Holy Shield without even judging crusader.)

</div>What is "doing it right" then, assuming some other tank body pulls or shoots a target to initiate a pull?  If your answer is judge-&gt;reseal-&gt;melee, then I'll refer you to my earlier post about how that's failed for me.  If I taunt, I end up with 3 on me in a hurry, with the other tanks in a bind because of HS threat on me (not to mention giving the healers a heart attack).  If I use AS, it's even worse.  I can judge JotC which doesn't cause any initial threat and then have a chance at my first attack seeing a miss/dodge/parry, or worse it might change directions before I even get a swing in.  Or I can juse JoR and virtually guarantee a mob locked onto me the moment it's within 10 yards of me.  We're talking trash here, too, which is almost always level of 72 or lower, with a 3% chance at a resist on JoR (1.4% for me, given the spellhit on my mace) or less.  That's a lot lower chance than that first melee swing failing to connect.<br>
<br>
I also use AW liberally.  That 3 min cooldown comes back pretty darn quick.<br>

				I see by your gear that you're mostly in ten man and tier 4 content.  So maybe that's where we have a disconnect.  Scaling gear up you get very marginal gains in terms of spell damage for the prot paladin, while DPS potential of your DPS classes skyrocket. When I started to notice that my threat wasn't pulling it's weight, the first, and most effective change I made was to start using JotC again.  Now someone at a different level than myself is having an issue with threat, and so I'm just giving the same advice I used myself.<br>
<br>
Use consecration even if there is CC in the pull, do it by moving the pull out of consecration range of the target.  <br>
JotC gives increased TPS at a decreased initial burst threat value.  This is typically fine because most classes have some amount of ramp-up time as they build rage/CP/debuffs/sunder etc.  If you need to secure initial threat, you can still judge righteousness first, but JotC gives great longer term benefit.

</div>I can see where it looks like I'm doing T4 stuff from my gear, but my guild is one of the many 5/6 SSC 3/4 TK guilds at this point (ZA fully cleared), with me filling some sort of tank role on every boss in those zones.  My DKP was screwy for a few months because my mage was my main that I accumulated a ton of DKP on, and that didn't get squared away until recently even though I've been tanking this stuff a good 5 months now.  In fact, the main reason I care so much about alpha threat is because of my mage and nuking behind tanks that couldn't quickly snap aggro onto themselves.  I use a different gearset for trash with ~550 spell damage and the Al'ar trinket, which might be why I'm having success with this.<br>
<br>
I really don't want to sound like I'm bashing SotC, as it is an exceptional tool for sustained threat generation.  But at least for me, it rarely ever sees the light of day unless I'm tanking something that will live longer than 20 seconds and is #1 target for DPS.</div>

</div>1hws does slightly better than reckoning on a single target given around 50% avoidance. We are not talking a whole lot, one way or another. The main reasons to not take reckoning over 1hws is the increased parry chances and lack of consistency on a single target. However, a lot of end-game tanks are taking it.<br>
<br>
Reckoning only procs on hits that cause damage. Parries do not trigger reckoning. Reckoning actually promotes SoV slightly, as it's more likely you'll keep a 5-stack on and can interleave SoR a bit more readily. <br>

</div>I ran the numbers for totem comparison using some generic baseline stats earlier in the thread, <a href="#post606646" target="_blank">HERE</a>.  One major thing to note is if you use WF you cannot use wizard oil.  WoA + oil is better in most cases, but if you're grouped with warrior tanks WF will still give you a substantial threat boost while benefiting them as well.<br>
<br>
As an aside, Reckoning + WF + SoV means you'll almost never need to worry about losing the stack.  However, as you get in more swings SoR's effectiveness jumps up greatly.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I think this will be a great meta gem for pallies, especially once you start to get a nice high block value.<br>
<br>
Question I'm wondering on it is it 10% off the top, or 10% onto your base block value.<br>
<br>
Shield specialization gives 30%<br>
So say your natural block value is 300 (which is reasonable for SSC/TK) would give you 390bv with talents.<br>
<br>
So is this extra 10% making it 10% more than the 390, or the 300?<br>
<br>
300*(.3+.1) = 120bv total<br>
390*.1 = 129bv total<br>
<br>
So in this example it's an extra 30 or 39 block value.<br>
<br>
Especially for fast hitting mobs, blocking an extra 30 damage per swing will add up pretty quick, and with health pools around 22k+ with buffs for an SSC/TK gear level this might be the spot to shave off a few hit points for survival.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>I think the actual question here is:<br>
Is the +10% added to the 30% to equal a +40% increase? {[Base] x (1 + 0.3 + 0.1)}<br>
Or is the +10% multiplied into the total? {[Base] x 1.3 x 1.1}<br>
<br>
It doesn't matter if it is {[Base] x 1.3 x 1.1} or {[Base] x 1.1 x 1.3}, the result is the same. I am inclined to believe that this will be the case, but verification from someone on the PTR would be great.</div>

</div>Reckoning will only proc when you take damage from a melee or ranged physical attack. It will not proc on Miss, Dodge, Parry, or Full Block. It will only proc on Partial Block, Hit, Crit, or Crush. As your gear scales up, you eliminate more and more of the hits on yourself that would proc it.<br>
<br>
1hws increases all damage however, including fire shield, thorns, retribution aura, holy shield, avenger shield, seals, judgements, consecration, and white damage. The increase across the board from this is hard to ignore compared with the diminishing returns from reckoning as you gear up.<br>
However, at the highest current gear levels, there are more and more circumstances where increasing all damage is a bit less important than keeping that SoV up. I am not at that point yet, so others here may be able to answer you better.<br>
<br>
I haven't seen many specs that go with both Reckoning and 1hws, though if you were to drop 5 points for reckoning, then the best place would probably be to pull them from Deflection, since Deflection specifically decreases the chance for reckoning to proc. The only time Ardent Defender is worth dropping is if you are getting hit for 36% or more of your health per hit, which is very rare, and normally a warrior or bear would be tanking instead.</div>

 Well I'm just curious if anyone has noticed any issues with threat generation. In particular is there a TPS cap?<br>
I typically out TPS anyone in my raid, I even can pull agro off our MT after he has initial threat on it. Meaning he's already been taking hits and I pull mob off without RD or HS threat.<br>
<br>
However lately I've been having a harder time and my DPSers are often agroing off me and I have no reason why!<br>
I even have a ret pally in my group generally, I've added 2% threat to my gloves and had some upgrades to my gear. Which says to me I should have less and less problems generating threat and holding mobs on me. In particular I'm noticing problems on single target adds.<br>
<br>
Is this a bug?<br>
<br>
my only other idea is that our tanks are getting better since I'm out performing them in threat and thusly they needed to step up their game and/or our DPS classes have gotten use to my threat generation and are thusly DPSing sooner then they should. (which I know happens, nothing worse then a pyroblast when your Judgement of Righteousness misses).<br>
<br>
Incidentally, does anyone know how to see TPS from wowwebstats?</div>

I even have a ret pally in my group generally, I've added 2% threat to my gloves and had some upgrades to my gear. Which says to me I should have less and less problems generating threat and holding mobs on me. In particular I'm noticing problems on single target adds.<br>
<br>
Is this a bug?<br>
<br>
my only other idea is that our tanks are getting better since I'm out performing them in threat and thusly they needed to step up their game and/or our DPS classes have gotten use to my threat generation and are thusly DPSing sooner then they should. (which I know happens, nothing worse then a pyroblast when your Judgement of Righteousness misses).<br>
<br>
Incidentally, does anyone know how to see TPS from wowwebstats?</div>

</div>With your ~630 spell damage, you shouldn't have any trouble holding aggro. MY gut tells me that it is the Righeous Fury bug cropping up for you. Try re-casting Righteous Fury before every fight like I do now. See if the problem goes away or diminishes.<br>
<br>
Doing this has eliminated the bug for me, and with ~500 spell damage, I easily hold threat over my BT geared DPSers, though the gap IS slowly closing. There is no reasonable reason why your DPSers would be passing you in SSC/TK gear with your level of spell damage.</div>

		<div id="post_message_641489">Thank you for the quick response. I did here about the RF bug and I do always make sure i have it rebuffed before bosses. However I don't necessarily do it before every trash pull. I wonder if Blizzard has confirmed this to be an actual bug.<br>
<br>
Hmm going to have to check some TPS meters to see if I can narrow the problem down. I was concerned there was a threat cap I didn't know about.</div>

		<div id="post_message_642107">I'm quickly levelling a tankadin as an alt for usage in 5-man heroics/10-mans, as within my guild and group of friends there seems to be a dearth of tanks willing to run these (all our 25-man tanks log off/respec the moment Hyjal and BT are cleared for the week). Admittedly I've never played a tanking class before, and as a healing lead the majority of my understanding of paladin mechanics only relates to their healing and utility capabilities, but I'm doing my best to educate myself so I can be ready to jump right in at 70.<br>
<br>
However, I have a couple of questions about some observations about tankadins I've seen, and theorycrafting I've seen posted on other paladin boards.<br>
<br>
The primary question I have is about gearing for Mitigation vs. Avoidance as a tankadin, and closely related to that, the usage of Reckoning. I was shocked to find that hardly any high-end pally tanks spec for Reckoning, as I was under the impression that this, along with Righteous Fury, was the single most powerful threat tool in the tankadin's arsenal. I thought the whole point of foregoing CC in order to hold threat on multiple mobs in instance pulls was to be able to get as many creatures beating on you as possible and therefore proccing Reckoning as often as possible, allowing you to easily build threat. As such, I figured that the best gearing strategy for a beginning tankadin, once Defense cap is met, would be to gear towards block rating and block value; parrying and dodging weren't really in my best interest, as I would actually WANT to get hit, but of course try to soften the blows of these many hits through Stamina, AC and block rating/value.<br>
<br>
However it seems that most tankadins are gearing for avoidance instead of mitigation, and dropping Reckoning altogether. Is this a strategy that only becomes necessary in 25-mans with extremely hard-hitting raid bosses, and for the sort of content I'm planning on using my tankadin for, Reckoning + mitigation gear is going to serve me well? Or is it silly to gear/spec for mitigation even in heroics and 10-mans?</div>

</div>It's not that high end tanks don't want Reckoning (Trust me I miss it while soloing.  Dishing out 2.5k damage in one swing as prot? ), it's that all things considered there's better places to put your talents.  Most people have chosen either Reckoning or 1-handed spec for their threat points.<br>
<br>
Reckoning excels in two places.  The first is with a fast hitting boss, like Prince in Kara.  The second is when you have a lot of things beating on you at once.  The problem with the second, is that when you do have multiple mobs hitting you, Reckoning's threat increase will only affect the one mob you're attacking.  1-handed spec affects all sorts of threat sources, like consecration, holy shield, etc.<br>
<br>
Mitigation gear will serve you well in heroics and 10-mans, although you'll notice you want to up your avoidance a bit for places like ZA.  I also doubt you're actually seeing a lot of paladins gearing up specifically for avoidance.  Most of the banter in this thread and the ones it replaces leads me to believe that most pallies gear similar to protection warriors a lot of the time.  Less emphasis and hit and expertise, with that devoted to spell damage instead, but pretty similar.<br>
<br>
About wanting to get hit.  Turns out that this is only really the case for when you overgear someplace.  On any progression content (even if it's only progression for your alt...), you should get plenty enough mana returned from SA, even if you're gearing a bit not to get hit.  And once you get overgeared, then you can do things like removing your shield (yay Al'ar's adds...), or turning your back, in order to take more damage.</div>

		<div id="post_message_642815">I've been told there's currently some sort of a weird bug with Prince and paladin threat mechanics. Maybe you guys know something about this.<br>
<br>
I was brought in for Prince last night on my tankadin. Fine, no problem, tanked him dozens of times. When he got into phase 2, I'd actually be low on mana from taking so little damage, never spiking below 80% health, and then suddenly BAM.<br>
<br>

<br>
That's 17k damage instantly. I didn't get parried or anything. It's like he charged up an old school reckoning bomb and laid me out with it. (not sure why those unblocked hits, either he ate through my holy shield charges or caught me in the gap between uses. I do have &gt;103% avoidance unbuffed using the macro in the top post.)<br>
<br>
Can anyone explain this?</div>

		<div id="post_message_643007">Prince Malchezaar has the ability "Thrash", which is a chance on hit to instantly get another two hits. He also typically swings his main and off-hand at the same time in phase two. In this case his main-hand procced Thrash, creating two extra hits, and his off-hand hit you too. That happens and there isn't much you can do about it if you're unlucky and get hit by all blows.<br>

I'd ask about the lack of blocks but I know from experience that dual wielding mobs can go through your Holy Shield charges pretty quick if you're unlucky.</div>

		<div id="post_message_643015">Hi Guys,<br>
<br>
I'm new to the forum, and I've been working hard at getting my tankadin up to speed. I'm not sure if i am posting this in the right place, please don't flame me if it is.<br>
I've only been playing the game for  just over a year now, and our guild has only starting raiding Kara for the past couple of months. Two weeks ago was the 1st time we took down the dragons, thus clearing the whole thing. I am just over half way "Kara-geared" and up till now have been focusing primarily on Stam while trying to keep up some Spell Damage to keep up threat.<br>
My healers have been complaining a bit about how i need so many heals, as compared to our other tanks - a druid and warrior. This has lead me to the forums which I now realize that my avoidance is not up to par. I have recently made a couple of changes at the expense of Stam and Spell Damage. After doing this, the change in my avoidance was quite small and I am quite disheartened about the whole thing. <br>
<br>
Could anyone that has some time to help a fellow prot pally, check out my toon on the armory and send me any feedback?<br>
<br>
My avoidance currently is at 82.6.</div>

<br>
The short version is that you are ignoring defensive stats in favor of threat. Until you're knocking on the door of 102.4% avoidance you should not be socketing or wearing items with spell damage over those with avoidance stats (except for your weapon). Respec and take Deflection. Buy the <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29388"><span><span class="purplename">[Libram of Repentance]</span></span></a>.

Is the +10% added to the 30% to equal a +40% increase? {[Base] x (1 + 0.3 + 0.1)}<br>
Or is the +10% multiplied into the total? {[Base] x 1.3 x 1.1}<br>
<br>
It doesn't matter if it is {[Base] x 1.3 x 1.1} or {[Base] x 1.1 x 1.3}, the result is the same. I am inclined to believe that this will be the case, but verification from someone on the PTR would be great.</div>

</div>So the actual question is the same question...<br>
<br>
Assuming the same 300 base.<br>
<br>
(300*1.3*1.1)=429 or 129 extra<br>
300*(1+0.1+0.3)=420 or 120 extra<br>
<br>
You used the exact same formulas as I did, just stated them differantly ;D<br>
<br>
But at least we agree that's the question we'd like answered.<br>
<br>
Working on the reputation on the test server myself to test this out, but if someone beats me to the punch please post it.</div>

		<div id="post_message_643416">There is definitely something odd about Prince and paladins. The other day I was tanking him, and dropped from full to dead in a split second. Grim Reaper showed me as having been healed up to full, hit once for 2k, then I parried and dodged, then a 3k heal, and then a 2k hit, with that last 2k hit killing me.<br>
<br>
No enfeeble in the log, and no idea how I could have gotten hit with one anyway. Everyone had Omen, and I was well above everyone else on the threat list. Which even if you figure in some sort of issue with him and paladin threat (Maybe RF not effective threat as far as enfeeble checks the threat table), you would figure that it would show up in the log still.<br>
<br>
I've tanked Prince plenty of times, and only had this happen once, so I figure it's best to just write the occurrence off, and continue on. Would be nice if it got fixed, though</div>

</div>Speaking as someone that has it, POJ does actually work to help resist abilities in PvE. However the chance seems lower than expected; ever since I specced it I've seen full resists on abilities like High Warlord Naj'entus's Tidal Burst where I'd never seen one before I had it.<br>
<br>
It still works out worse on overall damage reduction than Spell Warding does however.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">There is definitely something odd about Prince and paladins. The other day I was tanking him, and dropped from full to dead in a split second. Grim Reaper showed me as having been healed up to full, hit once for 2k, then I parried and dodged, then a 3k heal, and then a 2k hit, with that last 2k hit killing me.<br>
<br>
No enfeeble in the log, and no idea how I could have gotten hit with one anyway. Everyone had Omen, and I was well above everyone else on the threat list. Which even if you figure in some sort of issue with him and paladin threat (Maybe RF not effective threat as far as enfeeble checks the threat table), you would figure that it would show up in the log still.<br>
<br>
I've tanked Prince plenty of times, and only had this happen once, so I figure it's best to just write the occurrence off, and continue on. Would be nice if it got fixed, though</div>

</div>Things don't always appear in the combat log in the same order they happen on the server, and you can get weird effects where the server reports your death first, and then doesn't bother reporting the enfeeble that came right before it.<br>
<br>
I've personally experieced at least one case where as a tank I got enfeebled on the transition from phase 1 to phase 2 even when I've got a clear threat lead, and I've heard secondhand reports of it happening several more times.<br>
<br>
So basically: (a) enfeeble bugs out sometimes, and (b) don't rule it out just because the combat log doesn't show it.</div>

</div>I have had PoJ for a while, it gives 3% spell miss on NPC as well as PVP targets.  Note that mobs and players already have a high chance to hit, so you would have to be hit by many spells before the talent's 3% spell miss shows off.</div>

</div>I'm not sure it is only Prince; I think there is an issue with some other Karazhan bosses as well. (I was tanking Illhoof the other day on my Paladin alt, and had Omen showing me at a ~25-30% threat lead over the hunters when Illhoof decided he was bored of me, went and one-shotted a hunter and then a shaman healer.) The issue may just may be more noticeable on Prince because of enfeeble.<br>
<br>
Just out of curiosity, does enfeeble not hit his current target or not hit the highest threat target? If someone is operating at, say, 105% threat but hasn't yet pulled agro, would that cause a tank enfeeble?<br>
<br>
All in all, I wish I could figure out what the RF bug is and fix it, as the glitchiness is somewhat annoying.</div>

		<div id="post_message_644377">Your threat on Illhoof can seem lower than it is because the threat from your mana gains from Spiritual Attunement gets divided by the amount of aggro targets. With the amount of adds in the Illhoof encounter, that basically means that Spiritual Attunement doesn't generate much threat at all, but Omen still attributes the normal amount of threat for it. Our hunters also constantly complain about Feign not properly resetting aggro despite the threat meter showing otherwise, and them using it as normal, that might be a factor too.<br>
<br>
Though him attacking a resto shaman after that is pretty strange. Healing threat is always the easiest to outaggro speaking as a Paladin, and that is even more the case on an encounter with many adds like Illhoof (For the same reason as Spiritual Attunement threat being less).<br>
<br>
As far as I know Enfeeble at least ignores the target with highest threat; which doesn't necessarily mean his current target. However, the ability is also bugged as far as I know that it ignores it's standard targeting rules if cast during a phase shift.</div>

</div>Good to know; I had not thought about that. Although, somehow it seems like it shouldn't be 25-30% off; I don't take that much damage.<br>
<br>
The shaman in question was PvP specced (no threat reduction), chain healing, and unsalved. So I can see where he came in second to the hunter, but I honestly didn't expect it to be an issue... especially since healing threat is supposed to get split among all targets just like SA threat is.</div>

</div>I'm quite intrigued by this bug, mostly because I haven't seen any direct evidence of it myself.  Sure, I'll "randomly" lose aggro at times, but most often it's easily attributed to a mistake I made or a DPS blindly mashing buttons with zero regard to threat.  Hunters are extremely prone to pulling aggro simply because they have no inherent threat reduction from talents, and paladins generally give them might and wisdom before salv (Feign Death lol), so mabye that has something to do with your experience.  I've run into a number of hunters who simply beat the hell out of their Steady Shot macro then blame me for lack of threat generation, which is always a fun conversation to have.<br>
<br>
At any rate, if you think you've experienced this bug, there are a few questions to be asked before we can have any hope of identifying the problem.<br>
<br>
* Which fight was it?<br>
* If you were fighting a specific add, which one was it?<br>
* What was your general spell selection used to maintain threat generation?<br>
* What threat meter are you using?<br>
* What threat meter is the aggro puller using?<br>
* Are the two of you using the same version?<br>
* Are the two of you using the most current version?<br>
* How much of a threat lead did you have before the person pulled?<br>
* Most importantly, did you actually have Righteous Fury buffed for the entire duration of the fight?<br>
<br>
TBH, I'm more inclined to trust Blizzard's threat mechanics over a mod that someone has created to estimate how much threat is actually on a given target.  That's not to say that RF is infalliable, as it is certainly possible there is a bug in Blizzard's code, but I'm going to be far more suspicious of 3rd party programs and human error when it comes to tracking down this sort of problem.<br>
<br>
PS - In regards to Feign Death, it frequently needs a second to actually perform the threat wipe (client-server latency issue, perhaps).  Having a hunter myself, I've run into cases where the FD cooldown was used and I went back to shooting, only to pull aggro almost immediately.  If your hunters frequently have this problem, have them wait a second before breaking feign before they start shooting again.</div>

</div>Most likely close, but not the same. Seems like there's a new Omen out every day, almost, so we're all in various degrees of updatedness. I keep mine up-to-date within 2-3 weeks of the release; not sure about the hunters in question.<br>

</div>Hard to say in terms of numbers, because I had not checked specifically. At about 30-45 seconds into the fight, I checked in at a 25% or so threat lead above the closest DPS, which was the hunter. At my TPS (which admittedly is not that high), that should have been around an 7k-9k threat lead.<br>
<br>
The threat pull happened on a demon chains a few seconds after I had last checked threat. I switched to the chains to drop a judgment and Illhoof deagroed me and ran at the hunter. I can't say 100% that the hunter did not do an insane string of crits just prior to the chains, but it seemed pretty odd. It's more likely that I just wasn't as far ahead as Omen reported me to be.<br>
<br>
Come to think of it, I wonder if Omen reports damage done to imps via consecrate as threat for me on Illhoof? If so, that would cause a lot of padding in my threat numbers that really isn't there. (We have a warlock "tanking" the imps, but even so I am damaging - and agroing - some of them with consecrate.)<br>

		<div id="post_message_645354">First, in regards to the current thread of discussion:<br>
<br>
1: I've seen the enfeeble bug (tank instantly dieing) on a warrior during that fight.  We made fun of him for weeks <br>
<br>
2: The threat issue.  This is not just a paladin issue.  Twice in one night during Kael'thas attempts a few months back, our warrior prot tank who has never had threat issues and has been one of the best warriors on the server, both pre-bc and now, lost aggro on Kael'thas.  Not just lost aggro, killed a stupid hunter or mage, and went back to him.  Even after he went back in to melee range of KT, he went straight down the aggro list, even chasing down healers.  It's a game bug, not a Paladin bug.<br>
<br>
3: Threat meters suck.  Our guild uses them on Bloodboil only and nothing else.  They are inaccurate due to it being a user mod using guesstimate numbers, they are a crutch players start to rely on and then use as a defense (but the meter said I was ok!), and for me, it takes up more room on my screen   Players should know their own dps, know their tanks TPS, especially in high-end guilds.<br>
<br>
Edit #1: In response to KRIS about his gear level, tanking in hyjal etc.<br>

</div>Armory me. I still have blue bracers, and kara gear mostly.  My shield is the Crest of Shatar.  My trinket is still Adamantite.  My helm? /sigh  My chest? it's heroic gear.  My shoulders/gloves? T4.  I tank all 4 trash waves hyjal, lots of trash in BT, can tank RoS p3, OT'd Mother, and am currently tanking 1 of the Illidari council with no problems.  Paladins are a lot different than warriors.  And my healers rock ^^<br>
<br>
Looking at your armory, you have put way too much emphasis on spell damage, and I notice you still have healing items as part of your tanking gear.  You are crushable and critable, and that should be your #1 priority.  Drop all that spell damage stuff, socket dodge/defense to get 490 defense and 97% avoidance.  618 spell damage is what you need to hold aggro in late-stage bt, not karazhan. As well, when you don't have 490 defense, I question why you would put points in to Reckoning over the extra 4 defense.<br>
<br>
<br>
Going a little OT to the previous threads.<br>
<br>
So, we killed Mother for the first time last week.  Really easy, just sat next to some druid bear thingie and pushed some heal thingie in my tanking gear.  With only 2 bosses left in the game until 2.4, we're getting pretty excited.<br>
<br>
My question/thought/whatever is the following: how important is Ardent Defender?  And I'm talking overall, not just MT but trash tanks etc.  I know it's been discussed before, but for five talent points, it's saved me twice 9 weeks of tanking as a paladin.  It seems it could go to something more useful, such as imp might (for the raid) or something like that.  Any thoughts?</div>

</div>Haha, no no no. That is not my tank gear, I completely forgot I'd logged in that last night. That's a "how much spell damage can I squeeze out" set that I use to rush lowbie friends through SM/ZF and such (the answer, FYI, was 666). Try it again now.<br>
<br>
This is my "normal" tanking set. I'm uncrittable and just shy of uncrushable. I do need full buffs to reach uncrushable in this set, but I have a couple other non-pally tank pieces I can use for 102.9 when needed.<br>
<br>
You asked why I've put two points in Reckoning rather than avoidance talents. I find 4% is my magic number to have Reck up in nearly every trash pull. It gives me the threat boost needed on the first assist target, and then I've got a sizeable threat lead on the other mobs.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Hi Guys,<br>
<br>
I'm new to the forum, and I've been working hard at getting my tankadin up to speed. I'm not sure if i am posting this in the right place, please don't flame me if it is.<br>
I've only been playing the game for  just over a year now, and our guild has only starting raiding Kara for the past couple of months. Two weeks ago was the 1st time we took down the dragons, thus clearing the whole thing. I am just over half way "Kara-geared" and up till now have been focusing primarily on Stam while trying to keep up some Spell Damage to keep up threat.<br>
My healers have been complaining a bit about how i need so many heals, as compared to our other tanks - a druid and warrior. This has lead me to the forums which I now realize that my avoidance is not up to par. I have recently made a couple of changes at the expense of Stam and Spell Damage. After doing this, the change in my avoidance was quite small and I am quite disheartened about the whole thing. <br>
<br>
Could anyone that has some time to help a fellow prot pally, check out my toon on the armory and send me any feedback?<br>
<br>
My avoidance currently is at 82.6.</div>

</div>First, your spec. It's okay except you're missing spell warding. That will reduce the spell damage you're taking. <br>
<br>
Second, you can reduce your defense rating to 490 and increase your dodge and parry rating. <br>
<br>
Third, you can look for gear that will increase your dodge and parry. Currently, you're crushable, which is probably the source of your damage.</div>

Even once you're uncrushable, defense is only slightly worse than dodge, and still slightly better than parry or agility.</div>

</div>Your armory shows 483 defense.  With a flask, you're still below uncritable.  As well, with a flask and all raid buffs, my math still shows you ~9% shy of uncrushable with Libram'd HS activated.  You might want to log in and recheck your math <br>

Quite frankly, taking the 3 points of out of Precision and putting them in to spell warding and the last piece of defense will increase your tanking ability.  At 462 spell damage, you're fine for threat for a long time.  <br>

</div>At what point during trash/aoe tanking do you ever fall below 35%?  Even with 18k hp, that's below 6300 hp.  If my healers let me go below 6300hp for more than a second, they're doing something wrong.  I could see the points being more useful by putting them in to the ret tree, getting imp judgement if you have mother libram, might if you have a lot of melee dps, hell even pursuit of justice for times when you need to run across hyjal to grab a mob that your stupid elemental shaman pulled.<br>

</div>Sorry Aes, I didn't see this post earlier.  Be glad to respond now.<br>
<br>
A couple pointers no one else mentioned: <br>
<br>
1: Get exalted with your scryer/aldor faction.  The shoulder enchant is a nice little boost to avoidance. <br>
2: 12 dodge, not 12 agility on cloak<br>
3: Do a little pvp, pick up a s1 mace and enchant it.  Then take your spell damage sockets out.  <br>
4: Unless you're having mana problems, take 3 points out of DInt and put 1 in sword spec for more aggro, 2 in spell warding for more survivability.<br>
5: Change your chest piece sockets to dodge or defense/stam trinkets.  That set bonus is baaaad for you.  As well, I strongly suggest upgrading to the Heroic piece.  If you have kara on farm, it should be easy to get, and it's the best chest piece for you pre-BT.<br>
6: I'm not sure about the resilience gem in your helm. If you were trying to match the socket, an 8dodge would've been better.<br>
7: What's up with your helm enchant?  Get a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080228003123/http://www.wowdb.com/item.aspx?id=29186" target="_blank">Glyph of the Defender</a><br>

</div> I can't even get armory to load at all to verify. If that's what it's showing, it's being wonky and showing me in a hybrid set I use to run heroics, which is not what I logged out wearing. I have 504 defense in full tank gear if my memory serves. That said, though, you're missing that I <i>am </i>uncrittable in the combo set. The resil on the S1 mace puts me over.  <br>

</div> Even in my heroics set with the Kara trash holy cape, at over 500 spell damage, I still struggle to put out enough threat against psycho DPSers in t6 with close to 1400 spell damage. Of course, I don't think I'm doing anything wrong - they're just way too overzealous and not respectful of aggro in anything less than t6 content. When your mage pulls with Pyroblast every time, you know they're not taking it seriously, but then they're all "wtf, paladins suck at tanking" when they die!<br>

<a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?talent=sZVhxIx0zggqtV0x" target="_blank">0/51/10</a><br>
<br>
The cookie-cutter 0/49/12 is a good spec in my opinion but I don't see why i should waste points in Spell Warding and Improved Judgement if i could grab Reckoning which really pulls out some nice DPS while farming and on trash waves.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I can't even get armory to load at all to verify. If that's what it's showing, it's being wonky and showing me in a hybrid set I use to run heroics, which is not what I logged out wearing. I have 504 defense in full tank gear if my memory serves. That said, though, you're missing that I <i>am </i>uncrittable in the combo set. The resil on the S1 mace puts me over.  <br>
<br>
EDIT: Yep, armory is showing old data for some reason. I've logged in and out a few times trying to get it to refresh, and no dice.<br>
 I definitely can't afford to do that. I already see ridiculous numbers of resists popping up, and Avenger's Shield wiffs at least one of its three targets nearly every single time, prompting laughter from my group at the wildly-careening spell graphic. If anything I've been thinking about getting some more hit.<br>
<br>
 Even in my heroics set with the Kara trash holy cape, at over 500 spell damage, I still struggle to put out enough threat against psycho DPSers in t6 with close to 1400 spell damage. Of course, I don't think I'm doing anything wrong - they're just way too overzealous and not respectful of aggro in anything less than t6 content. When your mage pulls with Pyroblast every time, you know they're not taking it seriously, but then they're all "wtf, paladins suck at tanking" when they die!<br>
<br>
 This wasn't directed at me, but thanks a ton for pointing it out! Back when I got the Illhoof cloak that enchant didn't EXIST on our server, due to poor luck in AQ. I'll probably just wait and pick up a Slikk first.</div>

	</tbody></table>
</div>I don't usually count resilience, completely an oversight.<br>
<br>
Your avenger's shield misses?  I'm rocking basically no hit with no precision and I rarely miss.  As well, I hold aggro just fine in a t6 guild, with 470 spell damage.  It's not your fault your DPS is dumb.  You shouldn't need that much.  So basically, all the questions about holding aggro etc. can't be answered here - you will have to talk to your DPS and explain what threat is.  As for survivability, my suggestions still stand.  <br>

				Hello everybody,<br>
<br>
I'm a really excited reader of this thread!<br>
<br>
I have a question about a talent spec I'm considering for 70 - Heroics, Karazhan, Zul'Aman till we decide to raid 25's.<br>
<br>
0/51/10<br>
<br>

</div>1: There are spell caster trash mobs.  4% adds up quickly.<br>
2: I don't usually use Imp judgment.  That will change when Mother decides she wants to drop my libram, of course, but for now I find that normal judgment is just fine.<br>
3: Reckoning is ok, sure, but if you want to go 0/51/10, take 2 points of it or precision and put them in spell warding.<br>
<br>
<br>
The talent tree you see on my character is 15 days old - that's how long it's been since armory updated me.  I change specs at least 3 times a week due to switching between holy and prot depending on the guilds needs.  I've experimented with 20/41/0, 13/48/0, 13/41/7 etc. etc. etc.  Lots of different combinations.  All in all, I find 0/49/12 or 0/41/17 to be the most stable.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">At what point during trash/aoe tanking do you ever fall below 35%?  Even with 18k hp, that's below 6300 hp.  If my healers let me go below 6300hp for more than a second, they're doing something wrong.  I could see the points being more useful by putting them in to the ret tree, getting imp judgement if you have mother libram, might if you have a lot of melee dps, hell even pursuit of justice for times when you need to run across hyjal to grab a mob that your stupid elemental shaman pulled.</div>

</div>Hiya, I see your point. I happen to have PoJ and I got rid of Imp Judgement because we actually have a raiding retadin.<br>
<br>
I guess my response is that shit happens in a raid. Since noone can generate more threat then me often I'm picking up loose adds, saving CCers when CC breaks, etc. On morogrim maybe my healer gets Graved from not paying attention, and I need that little bit to stay alive. Then there are trash pulls like in ZA where Ardent defender goes along way.<br>
<br>
I happen to like it for everything except boss fights, but that's just me.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

To me, this is one of the most valuable talents we can take. In the inevitable comparisons to warriors as tanks, Shield Wall is always brought up. This is our constant passive Shield Wall. And for me, it is active ALOT. Probably more than it should be, but even if healers kept me 90%+ 100% of the time, I would still take the talent, because we can't ensure that healers will always on top of their healing on me. Whether switching to new targets, sudden LoS issues, spell pushback, etc. On RoS Phase 1 (first attempt last week), I was holding cycle after cycle with Ardent Defender. I would drop steadily till 35%, then the 30% reduction is enough to be able to almost full block incoming attacks, and my health takes forever to drop from there.<br>
<br>
One thing that many people don't realize, is that even with T5 level gear, Ardent Defender is active for nearly as much health as the priests and mages have. Giving us even more reduction during that range of health to allow the healers to shift if needed is massive.<br>
<br>
<br>
Re: Spell Hit<br>
I have been seeing more and more comments on Precision and Spell Hit / Melee Hit. Most people seem to regard it as useless. I also see alot of comments about Vengeance not being reliable enough. On single target fights, I run around +8% spell hit and +5% melee hit, and the ONLY time I drop a Vengeance 5-stack is if I can't (or don't) swing on the target for at least 8 seconds. I have even been very successful in weaving Vengeance and Righteousness because my Vengeance proc rate and reliability has been so good. I have even been able to toss off Holy Lights while offtanking and still be able to keep 5-stack up.<br>
<br>
I recognize that Spell Hit is nearly useless in AoE tanking, but don't ignore it for the single pulls or the bosses. It really does make a difference. 2.4 is pushing that even more with Spell Hit on so much of our specific gear. (As they give us less Block Rating and more single-target tanking stats)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_647352"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I personally see the value in having spell hit as well, however, in it's current form spell hit is largely useless because there is almost no gear which provides both good spell hit and good other tanking stats at the same time. And as I've said previously, outside of situational cases I consider survivability to be the first priority in gearing.<br>
<br>
I haven't properly checked out the 2.4 gear however; if it really does provide a good mix of tanking stats, spell damage and spell hit I'd be pleased.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_647402"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The biggest problem I have with my paladin is our tanking stats are so spread out its really hard to focus on all the particular stats you need to improve your overall performance.  The bulk of my threat is righteous and consecrate and current itemization makes it very difficult to maximize tps with those tools without making big tanking sacrifices.  As opposed to say a warrior whose gear requirements seem much more vertical, if you would.  <br>
<br>
I can't see giving up shaving 2 seconds off my judgment.  Single target threat is too valuable to me at the t5 stage of the game.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

And with regard to:Judgement of Vengeance/Blood - 0.81 threat per hit (0.08 threat per second)<br>

The text below somewhat implies that this is per stack. So a 5-stack of Vengeance is .4 threat per second. Is that correct?<br>

What is a good amount of TPS for T5 level pally to produce?  And what are some ways to help them with that threat?   We recently brought in a prot pally to round out our tanking lineup.   We have BT on farm, and are almost fully geared.   he's coming in with mostly T5 level loot.   So far, threat is a pretty big issue for him.    People are capped a ton.  For example, on Naj'entus, people were reporting him at ~high 600 to low 800 TPS.     As a raid leader, I really want to give it my best shot to make this work.    But we really need to buff his threat output.   Now clearly gear will help that, but how much can I reasonbly expect from him, even fully geared (which may take some time)?    <br>
<br>
For our raids tonight and next week, I am planning on trying to give him a shadow priest for mana on low incoming damage fights, as well as a resto shaman for WoA totem.   What else can I to pump the numbers for him?<br>

</div>I would recommend eating the first pyro, then using the shield for the 2nd.    The reason?   It gives your healers a long time to get you healed back to full.   Also, I don't think you can DS it (maybe with perfect timing).   he's casting it on someone, if it's not  you, it's a DPS.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>That seems somewhat low.  Make sure he's using spell damage food and Superior Wizard Oil along with that Wrath of Air Totem.  Flask of Blinding Light would be preferred for him, since I'm assuming your healers can keep him up with BT on farm.  (alternatively, using a Mark of the Illidari for just a Supreme Power flask would work)   Personally I sacrifice a  bit of mitigation for damage when I find myself surrounded with T6 people, as I assume the survivability is less of a concern.<br>
<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">What is a good amount of TPS for T5 level pally to produce?  And what are some ways to help them with that threat?   We recently brought in a prot pally to round out our tanking lineup.   We have BT on farm, and are almost fully geared.   he's coming in with mostly T5 level loot.   So far, threat is a pretty big issue for him.    People are capped a ton.  For example, on Naj'entus, people were reporting him at ~high 600 to low 800 TPS.     As a raid leader, I really want to give it my best shot to make this work.</div>

	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Well 600 to 800 TPS is really low for a T5 pally, my guess is that he is using too much mitigation gear and not enough spell damage, I have seen a lot of prot pallies that commit that mistake while gearing up, there has tobe always a balance , and of course you need to have different sets for every situation. I personally have just 2 sets one for Mitigation/Stamina, mainly Mting in 25 man, and the threat set for AOE taning , offtanking etc... <br>
If he is T5 he would need to have at least 400 to 500 spell damage unbuffed and thats is really enough for sustaining from 1000 to 1200 tps, and thats offtanking trash , you should have even more by offtanking bosses adds or heavy hitters.<br>
<br>
Another thing that can help with his threat is, using spell damage food, wizard oil in his weapon, and even a spell damage flask if things are really bad, thats like 140 more spell damage right there.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>As the prot pally in our SSC/TK raids (just killed Vashj, for progression information), this is my big question.  How much mitigation is enough for different fights?<br>
<br>
Just because I manage to live through a fight with a certain mitigation level, doesn't mean its a good one.  Maybe my healers just rocked that night, but next time it'll be trouble.<br>
<br>
I admit I spent some time reading the prot warrior first post the other day, despite head-hurting calculus, and it really just made me wonder even more what a good mix of gear is.<br>
<br>
Aside from the how much +dmg vs. mitigation to use in t5 and t6 instances for different bosses, I am having some trouble finding any common wisdom around at what point shield block rating should be deferred in favor of dodge/parry or even armor.<br>
<br>
i.e. Once uncrushable (it is unquestionable that shield block rating is supreme for quickly becoming ucnrushable), should my entire goal be to start replacing block rating with dodge/parry...should I value shield block rating less or even consider it useless outside of AOE tanking situations once uncrushable?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Well its really difficult to generalize, so the best thing you can do is to know the fight and know what are u going to be tanking, lets put an example if you are tanking multiple weapons in Kael, first thing you need to know is which weapons are you gonna tank, what abilities do they have , and how much damage do they do, knowing that you can then make up a gear plan, in my case for example when Im tanking 3 weapons, usually mace, swords shield, those things can hit pretty hard, so I use my mitigation gear, but with a spell damage flask to balance things out and to have good threat.<br>
<br>
So the idea is just to inform you, or if you are learning an encounter for example you could just use your threat gear for the first tries and then add some mitigation if needed, trial and error since you are still learning the fight it really doesnt matter, you just gotta perfect the job you are supposed to do.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I am going to assume the Pally in question is Megor, as his gear sources seem to point more to being a main than the other Prot Pally I found in your guild. He is sitting at 512 spell damage, which is just shy of what it should be against T6 DPS. Flasking/Potting + Oil + Food should put him well over +600 spell damage, which is into the range that he needs. Adding a shaman for Wrath of Air is something all prot pallys pray for, and would definately give his threat a significant boost.<br>
<br>
If he is cycling his threat correctly or even close to correctly, but still having threat issues, then have him re-gem for less stamina and more spell damage. Your healers should be able to keep him up with as much as 2k less health.<br>
<br>
If this can help you gauge what kind of threat he should be generating, last night I did some testing against my guild since I noticed that our DPS was slowly catching me at buffed +489 spell damage as the raids progressed. I re-geared re-gemmed slightly to put me up to +635 spell damage, with Tome of Fiery Redemption proccing me to +925 frequently, and I was leaving our DPS in the dust in threat, even when they would open up as I engaged. (MH 5/5, BT 5/9)<br>
<br>
If he can get to these ranges and is still having trouble, then point him here so we can chat with him to figure it out.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_649313"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Here's the deal.<br>
<br>
I wore what I consider to be my average tanking suit for Najenteus that night (what you see in my current armory) because it was my first time ever tanking him. Mana was not an issue (although I did pot), yet the end result for that fight was poor TPS (600-800).<br>
<br>
On the other hand, in that very same gear, I have no problem sustaining 1300-1400 TPS (with frequent 1700 spikes) on Teron and 1100-1200 or so on Supremus. Parsing the threat from Exorcism, undead and demonic targets only grant me another 115 TPS on average, so Exorcism is not a magic wand for paladin tanking undead/demons (besides the insane initial and ranged burst). I run the exact same rotation on all of the above mentioned bosses (with Exorcism being the only exception, of course), and yet the massive contrast of threat I am capable of out putting from one encounter to another is staggering. My only theoretical explanation for this is Holy Shield. Against mobs that tend to eat up five or so blocks per cooldown, my TPS is easily over 1k all the time at a minimum (one good example is the sustained 2k TPS I can put out against the Malicious Instructor mobs in Shadow Labs).<br>
<br>
Fully buffed I run with around +600 spell damage (oil + spirit, WoA is not always made available to me). I generally flask up with fort to increase my survival against most BT encounters (including Teron, Supremus). Obviously, I will have to re-think Najenteus next time and try a flask of blinding light instead to see how far that pushes me. I will also attempt to aquire a pair of T4 or T5 legs and gloves as soon as possible in order to deal with this TPS issue in any way that I possibly can. I have deliberately avoided T5 in the past as there was never any logical reason to use it for the poor mitigation and health it offered in previous T4-5 guilds where TPS was never an issue for me.<br>
<br>
The very frustrating outcome of this conclusion, however, is that I am never in direct control of the quality of my TPS once combat has initiated. In situations where I equip extremely high spell damage gear (hitting +600 in gear alone) in effort to resolve the issue of my "horrible TPS" on trash, I often end up dead on the floor as the spike damage I can suffer in such gear is outrageous. Ultimately, my formulating opinion on paladin tanks is that we are only truly reliable on AoE trash and a small handful of bosses that inately make the most out of Holy Shield. I do not see the point of sacking my mitigation to such an extreme degree for a boss like Najenteus in which a warrior could simply mitigate better while pushing the same TPS.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_649332"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I've got a couple of questions about mid-to-late BT tanking. (We're at 7/9 and working on the Council.)<br>
<br>
1) Is anyone else noticing that while offtanking Voidreaver took a fair amount of effort (had to flask for spelldamage, chain-chug mana pots, etc), offtanking Gurtogg is almost <i>too</i> easy?  The first time we tried this I used threat consumables and ended up generating just insane amounts of threat.  Even after switching to fort/stam consumables, I still had to watch Omen very carefully to make sure I could pass off aggro before the bleed stacked to unmanageable numbers.<br>
<br>
Anyone else had similar experiences?  And if so, do you think this is due to mechanics differences between the two fights, or is it a result of some kind of insane gear-scaling?<br>
<br>
2) Any particular tips for tanking Veras (the rogue)?  I read in the IC thread here that he only moves 20 yards or so during stealth; is it possible to position him in such a way that you can drop a consecrate in the right spot at the right time and have a high likelihood of picking him up with it?<br>
<br>
Does AS count as a physical or magic attack?  (i.e., which blessing do I have to worry about?)  I picked up <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28767" target="_blank">[The Decapitator]</a> on a Karazhan speed-run earlier this week thinking I might need it as a physical alternative to AS.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>1) On Gurtogg I have noticed the absolute same thing you are talking about. OT'ing VR is a mana drain fest in complete contrast to Gurtogg. For one, the stacking debuff forces a ton of healing on all the tanks, which keeps our mana topped off almost non-stop (besides when we reset our debuff, but it VERY quicly comes back). Secondly, Gurtogg has several "drop aggro" moves, which greatly help in keeping the tanks close to one other on threat as well. Thirdly, I also believe that he hits fairly fast and thus makes good use of our Holy Shield on top of all that (comparitively to VR's constant de-targeting for "pounding").<br>
<br>

Is anyone else noticing that while offtanking Voidreaver took a fair amount of effort (had to flask for spelldamage, chain-chug mana pots, etc), offtanking Gurtogg is almost <i>too</i> easy?  The first time we tried this I used threat consumables and ended up generating just insane amounts of threat.  Even after switching to fort/stam consumables, I still had to watch Omen very carefully to make sure I could pass off aggro before the bleed stacked to unmanageable numbers.<br>
<br>
Anyone else had similar experiences?  And if so, do you think this is due to mechanics differences between the two fights, or is it a result of some kind of insane gear-scaling?</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>I would attribute this 100% to the sustained offtank damage with Bloodboil. Void Reaver has a much lower damage intake when you don't have the focus compared to Bloodboil. I struggle and pot to keep enough mana to keep a sustained threat on void reaver, until he turns to me, and then I don't lose him after that. Bloodboil has enough offtank damage that you shouldn't have mana issues. (I haven't tanked Bloodboil yet, first downed him last week on our 5th attempt, and was healing)<br>
<br>
Megor:<br>
It sounds like you know what you are doing, and your gear level should be sufficient. I don't see a quick explanation to the problem. My gut tells me that it is a difference in the fights that some aspect to your threat isn't up and running for Naj'entus. (like reflections not all reflecting for Naj'entus)  Holy shield is a partial answer, but doubt that it is the complete answer.<br>
<br>
On a side note, we went back to TK last night, and had a really wierd aggro drop problem on holding Telonicus, Phase 1. As far as I can tell, he simply dropped me from his aggro table. I engaged him and positioned him normally, was building threat on him. Then suddenly I disappeared from Omen and he went wild killing DPS, and as I attempted to get him back, Omen was showing threat as if I had just engaged, 25th out of 25 on the meter, and a bare sliver at that.<br>
<br>
Hopefully this was a 1-time freak bug. I held him fine for the next 2 attempts (attempts, due to one of our new warriors not handling pyros well)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>That is correct.  I mentioned it because it can cause a problem if you're mid-fight and think, "I need to throw my axe now," but you have your normal tanking weapon equipped.  If you wait to swap it you'll run into the problem where it won't be ready for another 30 seconds.  Or if you swap early, that's 30+ seconds without the added spell damage from your normal weapon.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_650185"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I recently tanked Veras and found a basically foolproof strat for him.  He appears near where he vanished, but has about a 15 yard wander range.  I just tanked him way off to one side and when he was due back I positioned myself in the middle of the raid facing the area where he vanished and mashed<br>
<br>
/targetexact Veras Darkshadow<br>
/cast Avenger's Shield<br>
<br>
I used <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32263" target="_blank">[Praetorian's Legguards]</a>, <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30896" target="_blank">[Glory of the Defender]</a> and <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30889" target="_blank">[Kaz'rogal's Hardened Heart]</a>.  That much hit combined with 3/3 Precision puts me missing 1.5% of the time or so but means at least I am facing him and in a good position to intercept him if I do miss.  Stacking some random + hit gear for this job seems prudent though since he doesn't hit all that hard.  I picked him up once with spell warding on but I just got lucky, he was near me and I bonked him with my stick for a bit and somehow got him to stick to me.<br>
<br>
One idea for picking him up with SW up is LOH.  You could just find a person at low health and LOH them and drink a mana pot.  It isn't ideal, but it does make some threat and hopefully puts you above other healers.  I have never done this on Veras, but I did use it on Illidan once.  I was tanking him and I died just as human phase started and had to be rezzed.  I stood up and dropped LOH.  Turns out that was plenty of threat to get him on me and we continued from there minus a dpser or two.  I don't know if LOH has a 50% normal threat modifier like other pally spells but healing myself for 18k or so was enough.  As a note though, my LOH heroics on Illidan were for nought, we died anyway.  I did tank our first kill for him though, which made me no end of pleased!<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I combed over the WWS log, and see absolutely no buff/debuff gains on the warlock tank that could explain anything like this.<br>

Perhaps Omen picks up on it when someone that is the listed MT suddenly loses aggro to someone that it thinks should be way below him on threat?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_650347"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Re: Spell hit<br>
<br>
I've been looking into the relative value of spell hit, hit, and expertise a bit and found <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080416142956/http://maintankadin.failsafedesign.com/viewtopic.php?t=3678" target="_blank">this analysis</a> which seems about the same as the numbers I ran. Does anyone know if this is correct? If so the conclusion should be added to the first post, namely for a single non-undead target  1 spell hit rating = 1 spell damage at a threat output of about 900 tps, 1 hit rating = 1 spell damage at about 1660 tps, and 1 expertise rating = 1 spell damage at about 825 tps. And in aoe situations spell damage is even more valuable. <br>
<br>
I don't know if that accounts for how SoV plays into things for alliance but it doesn't look like it. That would bring up the value of spell hit, but I don't think it would be a huge amount. Has anyone on EJ done a full analysis of the hit values that I have missed? I only skimmed through the thread I linked but it looks like their numbers are reasonable but are based on assumptions that may not be entirely accurate.<br>
<br>
What all of this ignores is the value of having a smoother threat generation that having higher hit gives us. Over time spell damage is more valuable until high tps if these numbers are accurate. However over the short term being able to reliable generate threat can be more important such as fights with repeated agro drops where missing a few attacks may cause problems.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_650461"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hi guys, <br>
  I see up above people are looking for good ways to pull mobs to them.<br>
<br>
On several different fights I use Healing threat. Essentially I have two warlocks assigned to me that life-tap down to about 60% of their HP. Every healer in our raid knows not to heal these two warlocks at certain moments. I heal them. This generates the required threat to pull mobs to me. In particular I use it effectively for <br>
<br>
Al'ar - Add tanking. I stand in the doorway into Al'Ar's room. When the add's spawn during Phase 1 I heal the warlocks lifetapping and the add's come straight for me. During phase 2 I position myself under the ledge of either ramp (because of the knockback I don't move in this position) and heal to bring the adds to me "IF" they spawn to far away for me to easily AS them. (we always have hunter's misdirecting too, FYI).<br>
<br>
Morogrim - I tank add's in a corner where I can not be Graved. When the adds pop I heal the two warlocks up with holy light or FoL and all the adds come straight to me, I consecrate when they get their and they're mine. It's quite beautiful in it's simplicity.<br>
<br>
Of course it's helpful when all healers have BoSalv on (including paladins) I usually do this blessing so I always remember to BoSanc. myself. Also it's important for no other pallies to have on RF, other than you of course.<br>
<br>
Try it out, it's great and sounds like it would work fine on that boss you in BT, which I have not seen yet.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">2) Any particular tips for tanking Veras (the rogue)?  I read in the IC thread here that he only moves 20 yards or so during stealth; is it possible to position him in such a way that you can drop a consecrate in the right spot at the right time and have a high likelihood of picking him up with it?<br>
<br>
Does AS count as a physical or magic attack?  (i.e., which blessing do I have to worry about?)  I picked up <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28767" target="_blank">[The Decapitator]</a> on a Karazhan speed-run earlier this week thinking I might need it as a physical alternative to AS.</div>

</div>Like Redcape mentioned, if you keep Veras on the far side away from Gathios/the raid you should have plenty of room to pick him up. He stands still for a moment after reappearing, so if you have a mark on him and stand between his vanish point and the raid you should have plenty of time to locate him and get aggro between AS, JoR, Consecration, melee attacks and RD. I normally stand him near the bench on the left side of the room.<br>
<br>
You can AS through BoP, and taunt through the spell warding. White damage with my Sun Eater and SotC has been enough for me to hold aggro for the duration of the spell warding. Capping melee hit is certainly not a bad idea for this fight if the trade-off in avoidance isn't too heavy for your assigned healing.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_650575"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Last time I tanked Veras I actually seem to remember seeing an "Immune" message when I attempted to use Righteous Defense to grab him when he had a Blessing of Spell Warding on him. That's very anecdotal however, I haven't tanked him often, and I've only had a single opportunity to even test this.<br>
<br>
And as the others said, he has to run a fairly large distance to even reach the raid if you tank him a good bit away. The only minor nuisance I've noted is that BigWigs at least (Unsure about other boss mods), does not report it when Veras gets Blessing of Spell Warding, so you have to give a yell in raid yourself if it happens at a bad time.<br>
<br>
I'd also recommend keeping an avoidance trinket and Hammer of Justice ready. While Veras himself doesn't do much damage on you, he's the one source of damage you can easily put a stop to in the fight, which can be useful if you get a Flamestrike and Divine Wrath on you at the same time.<br>
<br>
You also don't really need to use much mana to keep him on you, so you might want to consider helping out on healing people that get Deadly Poison while he's vanished; your Holy Light won't do much healing, but it beats doing nothing, and who knows, that 2.5k heal might mean someone just survives where he wouldn't have otherwise.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_650587"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->From my experience:<br>
<br>
Bloodboil: Yes, I've noticed that offtank aggro generation is considerably less painful. I think it's a combination of gear scaling and fight mechanics (more damage to offtanks - especially those that've been tanking recently and the current tank actively stopping threat generation).<br>
<br>
Veras: You can't totally predict Veras' reappearance spot (so pre-dropping consecration isn't going to work), but as others have said, you can keep him in a rough area of the room. In my experience he reappears and stays in place for a couple of seconds before moving, which should usually be enough time to hit him with AS. If he gets Blessing of Spell Warding immediately after reappearing, a well timed Righteous Defense will usually work unless he's managed to aggro someone out of range. Hvaing hunters ready for emergencies is probably a good plan. Trying to cap +hit (yes, it is useful sometimes!) is very good for the fight, given that both AS and RD misses aren't good. Beyond this I wear two clicky avoidance trinkets and HoJ him each tanking cycle, which results in very low incoming damage (basically what Chicken said).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Once he's close enough hit him with a judement, AS etc.. but get him coming to you by being highest on his threat meter due to healing. I haven't done the fight but my guess is noone else is touching and thusly he's going for healers first, you out threat them on healing meters and he's yours. Once he gets to you it's threat generation as normal.<br>

I see it like this<br>
he stealths (or whatever), warlocks life tap, you spam holy light on them, he pops, aggros you, consecrate, heal heal heal, gets to judge range,  judge righteousness, *GG*<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_650620"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Due to the nature of the Illidari Council fight (It has extremely heavy random raid damage) having a Warlock life tap to very low amounts of health is as likely to result in a dead warlock as it is likely to result in Veras heading for you.

For anyone who's wondering, Decapitator works like a charm when spell warding is up.  It's instant-cast with what appears to be a 40-yard range, which makes it very nice for this particular fight.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_650653"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Decapitator is always enough threat to get him.  Unless it misses.<br>
<br>
You also have a few seconds after he spawns where he's stealthed that you can get a melee hit or two on him generally, if you're quick about identifying his position and getting there. Obviously macro target him, and spin your camera so you see him as soon as he's up.   I don't know that I've ever had him get spell warding while he was still in the "stealth" position.  But that's not to say it can't happen.<br>
<br>
I normally find that unless you're distracted, you can get into melee range.  Of course, you have the bad-luck-combo occasionally where there's a blizzard spawning on you forcing you to take the long way around, and then you get a resist on your judgement and the decapitator misses, and you're stuck chasing him after your healers.  <br>
<br>
Anyways, I would hardly say in general you're screwed when he gets spell warding.  It is only difficult when he gets spell warding and starts moving before you have a chance to get into melee range, and decapitator misses or is on cooldown.  That requires a particular set of circumstances, and I've still recovered in those cases, though we might lose a priest &gt;_&gt;.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

If everyone is taking heavy damage then it makes it even easier for us to heal and get threat. Because you don't have to heal warlocks, just heal anyone who needs healed. If everything is working great for you awesome. I'm just saying if you have an issue picking him up you may want to try my suggestion. I was skeptical at first until I saw how awesome it worked and it only fails if I don't have RF up and healers aren't salved.<br>
<br>
However take this with a grain of salt since I have never seen the fight and don't know the specifics. I know alot of folks are hesitant to try healing threat with pally tanks. It works awesomely when applied correctly.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

The thought behind that is that we have a parryable attack once every [your weapon speed here] seconds; or twice in that time if you have Reckoning up. Warriors, on the other hand, will achieve a parryable attack once every [weapon speed here] seconds and close to every global cooldown. (There's some further muddling due to Parries speeding up your swings, but I'm choosing to ignore that since parry is theoretically equal between both our classes)<br>
<br>
Expertise also shouldn't be underestimated as a threat stat for a Prot Paladin; it's actually the best single target threat stat that isn't spell damage by a small margin due to it's high returns per rating. This post by PsiVen has the numbers on it: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080416142956/http://elitistjerks.com/535650-post186.html" target="_blank">http://elitistjerks.com/535650-post186.html</a><br>
<br>
Anecdotally I can add that I can't really remember parry strings causing high burst damage on me, but that's also in part because I typically leave the harder hitting bosses to other tanks. You can't build up an experience on stuff like that without actually experiencing it.<br>

Warriors, on the other hand, will achieve a parryable attack once every [weapon speed here] seconds and close to every global cooldown.<br>

Expertise also shouldn't be underestimated as a threat stat for a Prot Paladin; it's actually the best single target threat stat that isn't spell damage by a small margin due to it's high returns per rating. This post by PsiVen has the numbers on it: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080416142956/http://elitistjerks.com/535650-post186.html" target="_blank">http://elitistjerks.com/535650-post186.html</a><br>

Anecdotally I can add that I can't really remember parry strings causing high burst damage on me, but that's also in part because I typically leave the harder hitting bosses to other tanks. You can't build up an experience on stuff like that without actually experiencing it.<br>

</div>That post by PsiVen is wonderful, I'm going to bookmark it. I'm not that interested on the threat component of expertise but it's certainly better than I myself expected and it's good to know when considering tradeoffs.<br>
<br>
Regarding experience, why lie, I haven't tanked anything harder than Gruul (my guild has just reached the critical mass where we are able to put out 25-mans regularly). But after checking some of my logs, a big % of my deaths in - for us - challenging content were due to parry haste by the boss, so I'm intrigued if mitigating that kind of spikes was a feasible way to improve my performance. <br>
<br>
Those warrior posts you linked have also some very interesting block value math which is also something I'm researching on. I've neglected it and it's probably a much better point per point mitigation stat that I've personally credited it for.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_652923"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->According to Dorvan, who has done the math on maintankadin, "1 expertise rating = 1 spell damage at about 825 tps." This would, of course, cap to equal to the hit rating once dodge is off the table. Thus "1 hit rating = 1 spell damage at about 1660 tps."<br>
<br>
For council I tried a long time to Righteous Defense first with /tar Veras as the first line. The problem is Veras is selectable out of stealth before he attacks. He can often sit there for 3-5 seconds doing nothing, at which point the RD debuff wears off and he kills your healers.<br>
<br>
A far more effective strategy is to first rely on Avenger's Shield. A macro such as:<br>
/tar Veras<br>
/cast "Avenger's Shield"<br>
<br>
If the avenger's shield fails, he is going to be behind you. The target will go through as normal, though, and you can then rely on righteous defense as the debuff will more assuredly last long enough for you to throw a judgement at him.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_652967"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Regarding Veras, I'd like to second Beccas post, i do the target/AS macro as well, and keep RD as an emergency backup for the rare cases AS misses, but the fight is quite easy to shift your gear around, so you can easily be hit capped there, provided you have some warrior gear around. It's about the only fight i'm glad I picked the ring of Supremus... <br>
Since Aggro is a non-issue there, besides a few random DoTs no damage done to Veras, I switch to a "real" weapon there as soon as he gets the spell shield - not that it makes a huge difference, but like in any other fights where threads doesn't matter, it's good to have a warrior tank weapon around, those get dissed anyway once the one or two warriors got them, so pick one as well once you have the opportunity. Happens not often, but there are indeed cases where we can make good use of them <br>
<br>
However, I did read most of this thread, but mostly the first few, and about the last ten pages, and i've never seen Ashtongue Talisman of Zeal (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080416142956/http://www.wowdb.com/item.aspx?id=32489" target="_blank">Ashtongue Talisman of Zeal - Items - WOWDB</a>) mentioned. I've never done any math how this compares thread-wise to a spelldmg trinket, or the Tome of A'alar, but it's realy a 50% procc chance for 480 Holy damage, so it's up very often, especially with the Imp. Judgement talent. I use it quite often, especialy when i'm seriously overgeared (heroics, kara, hell, even in ssc/tk) and the extra aggro it provides is very helpfull for me.<br>
Like i said, never done the math how it compares to other aggro boosting trinkets at all, but for me it has worked like a charm, so i wanted to share this. <!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_653124"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->3 new bosses for me to comment on tanking on last night:<br>
<br>
Bloodboil:<br>
Our 2nd kill, I was tanking instead of healing. We killed him on the 3rd pass, but the issue I was having was too much threat. I was holding just below the 2 warriors until I picked him up as the 3rd tank in the cycle. I had him for ~8 seconds before he enraged, and in that time my threat climbed 40% past the warriors. After the enrage, I had to bubble after a bit to get him off me. On the killing pass, one of the 2 warriors went down, and the other warrior was having a ton of trouble staying ahead of the Circle of Healing priests by around 25%, and I was using bare minimum to hold him above healing, trying to give him a short of distance as possible to catch me. For the last 15%, he dropped to 7th on the meter, behind nearly all the healers (but still ahead of the DPS),  and my only option was to keep him, and I full-threat burned on him to keep him on me in the de-aggro, and was hitting single target TPS around 1800-2100, without burning my +30%.<br>
<br>
I agree, there is something more than just having unlimited mana at your disposal in that fight. The warriors had no rage issues at all, but were struggling.<br>
<br>
Mother: (First kill!)<br>
I offtanked for this ridiculously easy fight. My contribution was enough SR and health to soak, and keeping up judgement of wisdom. Not much else about it. She dropped my Tome though <br>
<br>
Council: (8% best pass)<br>
I tanked Veras, and our first 2 wipes were almost entirely due to Veras getting loose, so I thought I would post up my observations for any other pallys that enter that fight fresh.<br>
<br>
The first wipe was due to one of the holy pallys getting aggro from Veras from BoPing the mage that ran in to pull. I took over BoPing from there on, and it pulled him to me 100% of the time after that on initial pull.<br>
<br>
The 2nd wipe was due my mis-understanding of how he de-vanished. 'Random Location' often mentioned wasn't clarified, and I was running all over the room looking for him. The location is random, but within 15 yards or so of where he vanished. Holding him away from the raid makes picking him back up a piece of cake.<br>
<br>
3rd pass and on, I held him fine. I have a macro to /target Veras, /cast Judgement. I found this works better than Avenger Shield, since I can be on the run and still judge, where if I stop to throw my shield, and it misses, I often have more room to make up to get to him and no time to do it, as he is now moving. If judgement is resisted, then RD pops him back to me. Twice he came out of stealth with the magic immune shield, and RD worked perfectly to grab him, and then put up crusader to hold him on me, and it held fine, though with risky threat (healers reaching to 129% of my threat). Next attempts, I am going to be bringing the DPS 1 hander from ZA (forget the name, Pheonix boss drops it), and hot-swap it to help during the shield.<br>
<br>
My only healer, a holy pally, had no issues keeping me up, so we ended up tanking him almost in the raid so that her mana pool wouldn't be wasted, and she could heal the rest of the raid during the vanish, especially the poisoned ones. Later attempts, I got into a shadow priest group, and then was tossing flashes around while Veras was vanished. We didn't have a melee Dranaei available, so I only had one of them, but remember that if you are Alliance and having trouble with spell hit or melee hit on this fight, ask your raid leader to help stack your group to give you the racial bonus for both melee and spell hit.<br>
<br>
I also started taking alot of Envenom hits once I tanked him closer to the raid, which I preferred over a priest getting it. Not sure if my proximity matters, or if this was just luck of the draw, but by the end of the night when I was nearly in the raid, I was getting hit with the poison almost every vanish.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_653278">One of the other reasons Gurtogg is so easy to hold especially once he's turned to you is that he's got the attack speed of a dual wielding mob without the hit penalty. In other words, he's Holy Shield heaven; while I'd say a normal average per Holy Shield cast would get, say, 2 or 3 charges used on a single mob, Gurtogg will easily use up twice that, making Holy Shield cause twice as much threat as usual... And even with the 2 to 3 charges used it's already one of the higher threat abilities we have.<br>
<br>
It's also helpful you can swap to Seal of Wisdom during Fel Rage phases to regenerate some mana. While a Paladin's spirit regen isn't much, if you combine it with Seal of Wisdom it actually ends up giving a nice amount of mana back for each Fel Rage, meaning there's far less worry about running OOM.</div>

<br>
My guild is 5/6 SSC and 3/4 TK, and I've only been 70 for 3 weeks so my Reps are a little weak.<br>
<br>
I almost have enough badges to buy the <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33522"><span><span class="purplename">[Chestguard of the Stoic Guardian]</span></span></a>, but there will be an upgrade over that in 2.4.  That could be a month away, however; and the vendor spawning even later than that.<br>
<br>
Alternatively, I could buy the <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32083"><span><span class="purplename">[Faceguard of Determination]</span></span></a> since I only have 1.3 (although we always get R&amp;J) chances per week of an upgrade from Kara.<br>
<br>
I'm working on my Sha'tar rep to get that shield while I cross my fingers for a Nightbane/Gruul/Dragonhawk drop.<br>

I'm not sure where to go with my necklace, I guess just wait for a <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28516"><span><span class="purplename">[Barbed Choker of Discipline]</span></span></a>.<br>

</div>The last thread you cited here contains some wonderful insights for how various stats compare to one another in realistic encounters (i.e. boss fights) rather than theoretical "utopia" environments that we'll never see.  Thanks for the post.<br>
<br>
On that note, I'm wondering if anyone has done similar maths for paladins.  If so, I'd love to see it.  There are some pretty drastic differences between the classes when comparing stats such as block value and expertise.  The mechanics of holy shield alone throw a substantial wrench into things, along with added itemization budget needed for spell damage and spell hit.  On top of that, we need a raidbitch warrior to sacrifice personal DPS to keep up things like demo shout and thunder clap in order for us to obtain ideal values for each boss (and not every boss calls for excessive melee debuffs), and such a person would need to be seriously dedicated to the raid's success to keep 100% uptime on these two things.  Chances are this task has <i>not</i> been tackled, but probably should be.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">For those of you who do not plan on *main* tanking bosses, do not waste points on hit rating, expertise, or the hit talent.  They are not useful and the points and items can be used to buff other things, such as spell damage for threat or stamina/dodge/defense for survivability.  The only things that really matter that can miss/be resisted are the first tick of consecration (all the others automatically hit) and your taunt, which you shouldn't need while OT'ing bosses and has few resists as it is on trash.  While I agree they are good single target aggro holding abilities, I want to remind those of you who will not be *main* tanking 'real' bosses that these suggestions are for just those.</div>

</div>As a tank who has tanked through Illidan Phase 2, I think I'm quite competent for my class.  Expertise and hit help for single target threat.  Every trash pull in hyjal and many in BT are all about the aoe threat, which is based on consecration primarily.  As you have multiple targets hitting you, you need more mit, and as 90% of your threat is based off a spell, spell damage is more useful than either expertise or hit rating.</div>

		<div id="post_message_654532">Non-boss tanking isn't all AoE tanking. There are plenty of trash mobs that get single-tanked, and the vast majority of them do not hit hard enough to make min-maxing your survivability matter.<br>
<br>
Taunt, while in theory never necessary, in practice often is, and resists tend to cause deaths which leads to time lost. (Snap threat in general - i.e., not having your opening threat moves miss/dodged/parried/resisted - tends to be more important on trash where no one is going to spot you a 3 second lead before opening up.)<br>
<br>
So in summary I disagree, if you are speaking about non-boss tanking in general. You are of course correct that for strict AoE tanking hit and spell hit provide marginal use (taunting or judging mobs that break off after a DPSer or healer, mostly) and expertise is virtually useless.</div>

If you get lazy and don't judge when available or keep consecrate up or keep HS up, that's a skill problem, not a statistic problem.<br>

I heard something very nice from our Retribution Brothers. Vindiction procs Judgment of Wisdom. And now the nice thing, even on a immune target.<br>
<br>
Think about it. 1 Talent point spend on this will generate about 500-700 mana per Minute. <br>
<br>
I tried it while tanking in SSC and it is just incredible useful. I did not have to worry about my mana. Overall I needed less then 1/3 of the mana potions I usually drink.<br>

Anyhow, I just hope they are not going to change this in 2.4 (currently works in PTR).</div>

</div>The "Warrior" tanking chest in the new badge loot is far better than Stoic Guardian, especially since you can make up the spell power by buying the Paladin tank legs. (I'm going to guess you have or want to get the current badge tanking legs, as most of Paladin T5 prot sucks ass)<br>

To be honest, you'll eventually want to get them all, as the new Paladin tank chest is really good when you're AE tanking mobs that don't crush, and can stack spell power over avoidance.</div>

I can see how your comments are intended to be of assistance to new protection pallys, however the comments are being applied so globally without much explanation or detail, and it appears mis-leading. I believe that you do know the value of different sets for different fights, and that not being a main tank can mean many things, and that your gear should matcdh the fight. AoE tanking, yes, spell damage and block is king. Offtanking single targets with a Hurtful Strike type ability only, threat isn't important, only survival and mitigation. Offtanking tank-switching bosses like Bloodboil or Void Reaver, single target threat is much more important, and even then, more important for Void Reaver than for Bloodboil. Threat and mitigation isn't that important in Council tanking Veras, but spell hit and melee hit are critical to be able to keep him from running wild. <br>
<br>
So the changing fights require changes in gear, and if only 1 set of gear is getting you successfully through every fight through T5 and T6, then the rest of the raid is getting capped by you somehow, in threat or in how many healers they have to add to you to keep you up, depending on the fight. Or you are healing for every boss fight and your only tanking duty is trash.<br>
<br>
Granted, Blood Elves need less +hit of either type, due to Seal of Blood, but again, don't apply a statement globaly without clarifying. Alliance paladins need much more +hit since our comparative seal needs to hit with our weapon to get a chance to proc, then get the proc to hit, then get the proc to be unresisted. We can get blocked 1 of 3 ways, where yours can't miss. <br>
<br>
Again, I see your helpful intentions, but try to be less abrupt and vague with your statements, lest they be taken wrong.<br>
<br>
You can get by with limited choices of gear, but to be the best possible prot pally tank, go with multiple sets of gear, learn the fights, and swap gear as needed depending on the fight. That is the material point.</div>

		<div id="post_message_654889">Well said, Yenadar.<br>
<br>
Just to add another tought regarding different gear for different fights: Even if your regular duty is not maintanking bosses, it's never wrong to carry the gear that enables you to do so. I almost never do the tanking part in our "progression" kills (if you don't count Bosses that require multiple tanks, anyway), however I ended up doing so for Teron Gorefiend, and I can assure you, I was glad to take this job for a change. Why just stick with one set, if swapping around a few peaces will enable you to do a better job, enable you do do anything? <br>
<br>
There may be differences between Horde and Aliance Paladins, however, it can't be wrong to collect a few pieces of "warrior" gear with meleehit, so that AS just almost always hits Veras, regardless. Nor is it wrong to carry a physical tank weapon around, so I can swap once Veras gets the Spell Shield, or for the few occassions where there doesn't matter, but mitigation is king.</div>

</div>I don't think his comments are necessarily for new protection pallies.  I think they're for people who know they aren't going to tank bosses and don't want to have to think about how to gear from one encounter to the next.  For those folks, his statements are pretty much dead on.  If you're not going to face anything above level 72, the value of things like spell hit and expertise plummet.  A number of "up and comers" I work with on a regular basis just want one gearset (and spell rotation, for that matter) to do everything for them, and it's really not that simple.  That ties in nicely with your closing statement:<br>

</div>The reality is this: a lot of people don't care about being the best.  They just want to see what life is like as a pally meatshield.  And most likely, those people aren't reading this thread, so it's not worth discussing further.<br>

The rest of us, on the other hand, want to get punched in the face by every boss in this game, and live to tell about it.  </div>

		<div id="post_message_655174">Here is some analysis of the usefulness of <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30447"><span><span class="purplename">[Tome of Fiery Redemption]</span></span></a> and 5/5 Reckoning that might be useful to newer paladins considering either the item or the talent, and their benefit to TPS.  It would have helped me when I was deciding on the trinket, anyway.<br>
<br>
Note: These stats are pulled from a single VR kill.  I obviously could have been very lucky/unlucky compared to a norm with proc rates or the like, but its nice to see a solid example sometimes.<br>
<br>
This particular VR kill is a good sample for a pally tank, as I tanked VR from first pull to dead without losing aggro (stacked TPS consumables and managed to dodge/parry 83% of the knock-backs).<br>
<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302000554/http://wowwebstats.com/keqqltftrxqim?a=18&amp;s=12906-13257#buffs" target="_blank">WWS Link to Buffs Page for the VR Fight</a><br>

<a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30447"><span><span class="purplename">[Tome of Fiery Redemption]</span></span></a><br>
7 Procs, including (and this is almost always the case) during the first 1-2 spells casts as I pulled, meaning my initial threat build-up was fantastic with AW up.<br>
<br>
Blessing of Righteousness is the name of the buff.  It had an uptime of 105s during the 352s fight, so 29.8%.<br>
That comes out to an average +dmg gain of 86.4 over the whole fight, but keep in mind that I had the full 290 during at least the first AW use.<br>
<br>
Assuming 1 spell damage gives us around 0.5 threat per second, conservatively the trinket added 43.2 TPS over the whole fight.<br>
<br>
<b>Reckoning</b><br>
7 Procs, 33 extra hits.  Average melee hit for me was 122.  Average SoR hit was 214.<br>
Threat from an average hit then should be (122 + 214*1.9) = 528.6 threat.<br>
So 528.6*33 = 17,443.8 Threat generated over 352s.<br>
That comes out to an average boost of 49.6 TPS.<br>
<br>
Note that on this fight in particular, the boss hits like a little girl, so trading Ardent Defender (useless here) for Reckoning is a no-brainer, particularly with a significant and useful threat boost.<br>
<br>
I will update this post with any corrections made, so feel free to tell me where I went wrong on any calculations.  I originally picked up ToFR as I was first entering TK wondering if I'd REALLY get use out of it, but I have found it procs early and pretty much always during my first AW use, and am now glad I did.</div>

</div>Well, I was giving weight to the Paladin chest vs new paladin chest, but indeed the new 'warrior' chest piece has more desirable stats and the 'paladin' legs are better than current. I was just tunnel visioned in my response on those two pieces, not those three.<br>

Yes, paladin T5 sucks except for the shoulders. Up until recently I did use Tier 5 pants to offset some spell damage I lacked in other spots. Now I'm using the illdari rune shield and badge pants.<br>

</div>102.4% is correct. I assume the number on the first page is to say the avoidance needed from <b>gear and talents</b> which is 97.4%.<br>
<br>
Why the difference? There's a 5% base chance for the boss to miss you.<br>
<br>
So:<br>
<br>
102.4% = 5% base miss chance + 97.4% from gear/talents (which is dodge, parry, block and whatever your defense gives you).<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
As with many multi-tank bosses, once prot pallys reach a certain gear level, they can reduce fights to single-tank bosses. Illhoof and Void Reaver are the 2 most common examples of this. Certain fights will never be reduced to single-tank fights (Lynx in ZA...until level WotLK maybe), but Void Reaver is frequently solo-tanked by a prot pally.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I'm right at the point of trying to Kara/T4 gear my paladin alt right now, and I actually found it quicker to grind up the honor for <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28358" target="_blank">[Gladiator's Shield Wall]</a> (S1 Arena shield ) than to grind the rep for <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29176" target="_blank">[Crest of the Sha'tar]</a>. The only thing you lose with the Sha'tar shield is a bit of defense and a very small amount of dodge; everything else is a gain. The S1 shield has more stamina, more armor, and more block value.<br>
<br>
Also, I have found that the resilience on it is somewhat useful. It allowed me to dance above and below the 490 def. mark by a bit, which means I could equip a Stamina + Block Rating trinket set instead of a Defense + Avoidance trinket set, remaining uncrushable and uncrittable even though I was below 490 def. (I've had some upgrades since then, though, so I'm back above 490.)<br>

</div>The MT heroic trinket is a direct upgrade of the Darkmoon Card in my opinion. Though I would still prefer the Vengeance card over the badge/pvp trinket.<br>
<br>
As for your second question, farming heroics/kara/za (once your gear is good enough) as much as possible is by far the easiest and most efficient way to gear up any class these days.<br>
The NB shield (and in my opinion, the s1 shield aswell) is superior to Sha'tar shield, as grinding the rep doesnt seem to be the most efficient use of your time unless you plan on doing heroic Bota+Arca+Mech each lockout.<br>
<br>
There are a few of easily obtained very potent blue tanking rewards aswell, but those are already linked in stickies on maintankadin like this one: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080412173552/http://maintankadin.failsafedesign.com/viewtopic.php?t=163" target="_blank">Maintankadin :: View topic - Pre-raid Tanking: Theories, Goals and the Gear to Get There</a> .<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Edit: The tooltip does not show 2.4 stats which are: 33 Stamina, 21 Intellect, 21 Spell Haste Rating, 229 Spell Damage.<br>
<br>
Both items almost identical statwise except for the spellhaste vs spellhit, and with the changes to spellhaste lowering global cooldown to a limit of 1.0 versus the current 1.5 global cooldown I am trying to decide if this weapon is worth getting in place of the mace. Aside from stats, the fact that the sword is not a giant pink crystal is a definate plus.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>It's viable, but it's defintely worse than the Hammer is. Lowering the GCD does have some benefit, but even in fights where you use all your threat abilities you'll still be waiting for ability cooldowns to finish, so it isn't going to help much. The only time having spell haste would be a benefit is if you could get enough of it to make it so that you don't have to wait to cast Consecration until after you cast Holy Shield on a mob that crushes, and that takes 315.2 spell haste rating and you'd still be getting a better threat upgrade from using an equal amount of itemization's worth of pretty much any other threat increasing stat.<br>
<br>
It's got slightly lower spell damage too. Hammer of Judgement is pretty much entirely superior.<br>
<br>
2.4 is likely to introduce Season 4 as well; either immediately on it's release or a few weeks after it's release. Making <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32963" target="_blank">[Merciless Gladiator's Gavel]</a> pretty easily available, and while it's slightly worse when it comes to Stamina and spell damage, I'm pretty sure the spellhit makes it average out to be better when it comes to threat.<br>

</div>It actually only offers better uncrushability, not better avoidance. The difference is extremely small though, with the new enchant offering 0.2% dodge, miss and parry (or 0.6% total), versus the 0.63% dodge of the Dodge Rating enchant. It's probably worth using the new one simply since it offers better gear swapping opportunities for resist fights.<br>
<br>
One final edit:<br>
<br>
Has anyone done testing on <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?spell=46578" target="_blank">Enchant Weapon - Deathfrost</a>? I don't really have the time for this myself, and I'm curious how it's uptime is on a single target. It might be a pretty good mitigation enchant if it's got a high enough proc rate and uptime, though it'd probably be wasted if you have someone to keep up Improved Thunderclap since it's unlikely the two stack.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_657454"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->One of my personal goals is to tank VR for the entire fight. I'm rocking about 600spell damage, hitting my avoidance... let's just say I don't die.<br>
<br>
The problem I'm in encountering is two-fold.<br>
1. My raid leader is freaking because VR moves when I get knock backed and I keep agro. It's only about 1yd because I'm quick and hustle back to him on knockback.  But all the same he's worried about it and I can do little to ease this.<br>
<br>
2. I get knockbacked early in the fight before I have a chance to generate enough threat to hold him during a knockback.<br>
<br>
My opinion is that my raid leader shouldn't need to worry if VR moves a few yds during the fight, however if someone has a good way to avoid this (besides not keeping agro through the knockback) let me know.<br>
<br>
Also if anyone knows what sparks the knockback that would be great. I'm fairly certain it's random.<br>
<br>
Question:<br>
 For those tanks who have successfully tanked the entire VR fight. Are the other tanks fighting for agro with you or just sitting back and letting you tank it?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_657768"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->VR's deaggro is casued by a skill called Knock Away -- most boss mods (BigWigs certainly does) should have a timer for it.

<br>
That improves the odds a little bit, but you're still down to luck in the end.  More spell damage certainly helps your initial lead, but given enough Knock Aways, you're ultimately going to lose aggro.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Shields are to armor what weapons are to spelldamage: the slot where you get far greater returns than anywhere else.  It's not uncommon for the shield to account for over 1/3 of your total armor.  For that reason it's often worthwhile going for the highest-armor (and hence highest-ilevel) shield you can get your hands on, even if it doesn't have tanking stats on it.<br>
<br>
EDIT:  Also, even though I've upgraded to the spelldamage shield off of BT trash, I'm finding the PvP shield handy for tanking Flames of Azzinoth.  Crushing blows aren't an issue, and the resilience on the shield makes it easier to cap both defense and FR simultaneously.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I'm currently levelling up a protection paladin, with the intention of tanking when I hit high levels. But something which is a little unclear to me regards the threat from seals and judgements. Obviously, SoR and JoR provide threat through holy damage, and JoC adds extra threat during a longer fight. But what about seals and judgements such as light and wisdom? Do these effects add threat? And if so, who to? I ask specifically about the healing from seal and judgement of light. Does the person receiving the healing get the threat (like in Earth Shield) or does the paladin casting the spell get the threat (like in Vampyric Embrace)?<br>
Obviously if it's the former, then it does little for threat generation, but if it's the latter, and the paladin casting the spell gets all the healing threat, would this make these seals and judgements useful for tanking? Or is it better to stick to righteousness and crusader?<br>

I am in a position with my guild that I go back and forth between Prot and Holy depending on the raid.  While we are clearing trash in MH I am the AOE tank and off-healer on most bosses.  When we Archi or BT I am back to holy.  This makes me carry A LOT of gear.<br>

Anyhow, is Block Value important to a Pally Tank?<br>
<br>
I know Block Rating is needed to become un-crushable and is vital to what we do (from what I know, it goes into determining the percentage of what we block.<br>
<br>
Is Block Value the amount for what we block?  From what I have read, Block Value is important to Warriors as it is a coefficient to the damage in Shield Slam.  Does it have any significance in things Pallies can do (i.e. Holy Shield values?)<br>

		<div id="post_message_658570"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I got the Illidan shield today which brings my prot shield total to 3 (not bad for an offspec, now if only some more illidan healing loot dropped  ).<br>
<br>
Bulwark, ZA shield and spelldamage trash shield.<br>
<br>
I mainly tank ZA speedruns these days and am finding it hard to decide on what shield to use in which situation. Opinions?<br>
<br>
edit: better ignore my armory also, I have no idea in what gear or spec I logged (holy being my raiding spec). I used a blue +def trinket when I'm not wielding the Bulwark to maintain crit immunity but lets ignore this fact for now and just assume I only swap shields and maintain uncritability.

The wording causes me to believe it is governed by a debuff DoT ticking on the target to potentially proc.

				<div style="font-style:italic">Anyhow, is Block Value important to a Pally Tank?<br>
<br>
I know Block Rating is needed to become un-crushable and is vital to what we do (from what I know, it goes into determining the percentage of what we block.<br>
<br>
Is Block Value the amount for what we block?  From what I have read, Block Value is important to Warriors as it is a coefficient to the damage in Shield Slam.  Does it have any significance in things Pallies can do (i.e. Holy Shield values?)<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>
-G</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>First off yes, block value determines how much damage is negated by a successful block, which is based on the shields inherent block value, any items that have block value and a small amount from whatever strength you have.  This is also increased by 30% with the 3/3 shield specialization talent and 10% by the Eternal Earthstorm Diamond coming in the 2.4 patch. If you mouse over your block on the character screen it will say "A successful block stops X damage."<br>
<br>
Unlike warriors we don't gain any sort of offensive or agro bonus from our block value, as it has no effect on holy shield or blessing of sanctuary.<br>
<br>
That being said I find block value to be a nice stat to have once you've got the 102.4% uncrushable, a good amount of stam, and enough spell damage for your agro needs.  Depending on how much dodge/parry/miss you have it will vary, but Blocking is generally speaking going to account for roughly half of all incoming physical attacks (assuming Holy Shield is active of course).  So having a higher value to negate damage on half of the hits you take adds up to a lot of damage over time.<br>
<br>
I find it's especially nice on aoe trash like Hyjal, since you might block for 500 on each of 10 hits that would've done 1000 each, negating 50% total, as opposed to blocking 500 damage out of a single 10k hit for a mere 5%.  It's important to note that aoe tanking will tear through your holy shield charges pretty fast, but while taking so many hits the redoubt talent tends to proc pretty reliably, making Hyjal trash one of the few times the 5/5 redoubt that is usually wasted points (since any additional block rating over the 102.4% is pushed off the table anyway) that you had to take to get the 3/3 shield specialization, actually comes in mighty handy.</div>

</div>If Holy Shield isn't running out of charges before you can refresh it, any Block Rating is essentially worthless if it takes you further past 102.4% yes. An exception would be if you could get your avoidance high enough so that you don't even need Holy Shield to reach the 102.4%, but this has few practical applications. There's not much that can crush that's also likely to go through all your Holy Shield charges.<br>
<br>
Obviously Dodge Rating, Parry Rating, and Defense still have some value past that point in a situation where Holy Shield won't get it's charges used up when it comes to damage reduction, with all of those providing a full damage reduction as opposed to a partial damage reduction like block, as well as them taking precedence over block in how the hit table is calculated.<br>
<br>
In situations where Holy Shield *does* run out of charges, Block Rating does keep it's value as damage reduction; while any blocks you do are likely to reduce damage taken by less than dodging, parrying or being missed, Block Rating scales so much faster that typically it comes out about equal when it comes to total damage reduction (As in those situations the attacks are also typically of low enough damage for your Block Value to reduce the damage they deal a fair bit).</div>

</div>Resilience doesn't affect avoidance at all, and it won't impact your defense skill number.  Resilience simply reduces your chance to take a crit.<br>
<br>
If you're using a mixed resil/defense setup to reach crit-immunity, the only ways to check whether you've reached the mark are (a) add up the crit reduction from defense and the crit reduction from resilience and make sure they reach 5.6% (for a level 73 mob), or (b) use a mod like TankPoints to check that your incoming crit rate is zero.</div>

		<div id="post_message_660146">To bring up a very old topic, what do we know about RD resists, and whether it still works with spell hit?  <br>
<br>
<br>
I tried doing a test on the PTR using the mobs (68-70) + NPCs at the SL entrance.  <br>
<br>
0 spellhit/hit - 20~ casts, 1 resist (was more checking if I would see a resist in a reasonable amount of time)<br>
4.36% spellhit, 0.25% hit - 42 casts, 0 resists<br>
<br>
<br>
The chances of 42 casts seeing no resists, assuming spellhit does not affect RD and that base resist chance is 5%, is .95^42 = 11.6%.    It's not a very large sample size, but I was curious if anyone else had a better set of data or understanding of current RD mechanics?  <br>
<br>
Note:  RD would randomly not show in the combat log and randomly have no effect (again, not showing in combat log, so no indication if it was a resist or a miscast) on the PTR.   That makes my numbers less reliable.  <br>

<br>
<br>
On a slightly random note, I kept Sanctity Aura after resetting talent points on the PTR.  I activated Devo Aura and it's still there, so I'm providing 2 auras to myself.   If this bug goes live, that could be a lot of fun for Prot tanking. = )  <br>

I wish I had something to weigh in with, but nothing solid I'm afraid. I can report that I haven't seen many Righteous Defense resists since the change, but I can't say with any certainty if that's because it gets affected by both stats.

		<div id="post_message_660691">Block value is a waste of a stat when you want to reduce getting gibbed, compared to stamina etc. And if you want to minimize damage taken over time block value is a waste of a stat in comparison to avoidance.<br>
<br>
When you're taking small hits (generally not from a boss, aka AOE tanking trash which is the only real reason to even have a prot pally in the firstplace) block value will reduce a very large amount of damage due to both holy shield and redoubt (meaning you will on average block between 41% and 100% of the hits you take if you're crush immune against bosses - actual % depends on the incoming attack frequency and your block rating). Generally the more hits/second you block the more damage is reduced by block value, and only when you take that many hits will block value be something to seriously look at as a mitigation stat. And even then - if you're going to get stunned stamina and armor (and chance to be missed and crit) is all that will save you - so even for hyjal AOE tanking I'd just stack stamina/armor over anything unless you never get near abominations.</div>
