		<div id="post_message_706861"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Should probably add that the reason there is no clear winner when it comes to spec is that they depend on a lot of factors, mostly fight duration VS mana available, where arcane would clearly win on extremely short fights and fire clearly win on extremely long fights.<br>
<br>
And speaking of videos, considering most of the "my DPS is low what am I doing wrong" are simply caused by not casting enough and/or wasting too much time on movement and sometimes with a little not using cooldowns properly as an extra, actually making a low-medium quality video showing a couple raid fights with fully visible UI could be useful to avoid handling those continuously posting the same questions. And while we're at preventing old questions repeating themselves, you should probably write the first line in the post in bigger letters <!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_706868"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->You skipped over a few points, namely<br>
<br>
Arcane 'rotations' are out for good. This is an indirect effect or the int/spi changes allowing for very high AB dps% (in relation to other spells). Arcane new playstyle is mostly a reverse rotation; you cast AB to refresh the AB debuff to avoid having it fall down. Then you cast fireball/frostbolt in order to <i>generate</i> mana via spriest/JOW/mana regen as a filler spell whenever you can't sustain your AB spammage habits.<br>
<br>
There are a few points of contention as far as TC goes, namely<br>
<br>
for arcane spec (40/0/21)<br>
-&gt; I made an open challenge to anyone to work out the math comparing whether you are better off unstacking IV and bloodlust for the express purpose of being able to spam AB during hightened DPS/DPM times. You can frostbolt with bloodlust and IV stacked, but you fall below the 1s GCD, which is why I proposed someone to check out the math, so that you could continue AB spammage during both bloodlust and IV provided that they are not stacked. Personally my gut feeling says you're better off not stacking them, but its nothing scientific by any means. The math behind it is quite involved to say the least.<br>
<br>
for fire spec<br>
-&gt; TC does not handle 'proper' ignite management and assumes pretty much that every fireball will deliver its ignite dmg. In other words, it ignores the possibility of the boss dying before your ignites have had the time to run their full course. As a contention point there are many strategies for managing that, which are being somewhat contested. The possible options are roughly AB spam, AM, scorch and fireblast for the final 3-5s of a fight (in a context where you do not know how much time is left on a boss and yet have a huge buildup ignite). You know its somewhere between 0s left before boss dies and 5s. This also deals with travel time due to an indirect effect, basically, you want to avoid casts with travel time at that point in time because you want to be sure to maximize how much dmg you can deal given an unknown future. I believe only 1.5s casts should be used for that context, but again, this is debatable. Personally I finish fights with scorch/fireblast spam as a mechanism to lower this, but the practice is very much debatable.<br>
<br>
-&gt; as you hinted in your post, there is a contention point concerning how to stack cooldowns now given that skull does not stack with other trinkets (other than SCB). I personally believe that stacking everything minus [combustion / hex shrunken head] is the optimum choice. This implies that right after the 20s (of your cooldowns being active), you follow it up with [combustion/hex shrunken head] since you're still under the effects of bloodlust/flame cap/drums of battle.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_706917"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->To actually figure out the strategy for end-of-fight you'd have to define how the end-of-fight works, first. That means you'd have to figure out the probability density function for the fight's remaining duration as well as the stacked ignite damage and when is it going to tick off. Without that data there is no basis for any calculations of proper action.<br>
<br>
Anyway isn't the effect of these last few seconds rather small? You'd need a massive rolling ignite into the end of the fight which we already know requires cooldowns and even then still has a low chance to happen and doesn't last long. With you getting at least 1 ignite tick between fireballs the most ignite damage you could ever lose would be 1.5x fireball worth of ignites (0.9 average non-crit fireball damage lost) plus 2s worth of casting (2/3 additional fireball). Losing a whole fireball and only a single ignite tick (if boss died as your last fireball almost hit him and ignite from the fireball before was still waiting to tick) would probably be an actually bigger loss. Overall looks like the maximum damage you can lose, if you're just spamming fireballs at the end, is quite small. And when you think of the alternatives (that I doubt really have a higher success rate if you're not sure of exact fight's remaining duration) it just doesn't look like there's much point.<br>
<br>
Am I missing something and you actually have some huge ignite rolling when the boss dies or something? Or is this just trying to reduce that tiny DPS loss that's probably not possible to reduce by much if you don't know the exact fight's remaining duration?<br>
<br>
<br>
For stacking vs not stacking IV with bloodlust being worth it, I think it's too personal to make a generalization and just use something like rawr.mage to figure it out for your gear and fight.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_706976"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The debate is subtler than that. I define end of fight as 'a point in time where you know theres approximately, at most, 5s left before the boss dies'. It could be 0.1s before the boss death. Dodging away lost ignite ticks is a minor detail for the most part, but it can have impact bigger on other specs, such as arcane/fire, where you want to finish with AB spam (which you would probably end up doing anyway, but point being - you want to avoid if possible losing ignite dmg. The real point is more generic and subtle. Namely, given the context, <i>'are we better off switching to 1.5s- spells at that point in time in order to cast more spells before the boss death, even if those shorter-cast-time spells have lesser DPS than their longer cast counterparts?'</i> Ultimately, it depends on how much of a dps difference there is between your spells. I don't know if we could design a guideline that could give a clear answer to that. As I have hinted, I believe it is worthwhile for firespec to switch to fireblast/scorch at the tail end of a fight, but its nothing really scientific.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_707006"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->It really depends how sure you are of the remaing duration. If you think there are 0-5s left and it's evenly distributed, leaving ignites alone for a sec just for the sake of the example, casting a fireball would have 2/5 chance to land while casting a scorch would have 7/10 chance to land the first, 4/10 to land 2 and 1/10 to land 3. On average you would land 1.2 scorches VS 0.4 fireballs. Taking ignites into account and/or changing the duration range and distribution in any way can significantly affect that result. The sure thing is that the lower your certainity that the fireball will not land the more worthwhile it is to simply continue your rotation.<br>
<br>
Another thing to note is that even if changing spell rotation is optimal, it'll actually increase your variance in DPS (assuming you're still not certain of the time remaining), which may or may not matter. On fights where the wiping factor is an enrage timer you should probably just assume the fight ends when you die rather than it ending when the boss dies, since if the boss dies early you win anyway but if he doesn't you want to do your best possible. Then again even enrage timers aren't accurate enough since they usually don't instagib the raid.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_707027"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Just a quick note... I was 41/0/20 before and after 2.4, and Arcane explosion is rocking now. With Quag's eye, the 50% higher cap on AE, the improved mana regen from spirit/int, I am able to sustain Arcane Explosion spam on Hyjal trash much longer now for more damage, and if I get a haste proc or heroism things get even better. Before seed of corruption warlocks were crushing me on the AoE total output, and now I am competitive.<br>
<br>
AB spamming with 2pcT5 just got better too. Icy veins prevents interruption which offsets one of the big issues with AB...spell pushback. So I can pop all cooldowns in a DPS window and really pump it out without fear of interruption.  Mana regen lets you go longer. I agree with Manly that the new mode is to AB spam til dry then recover with efficient frostbolt spam. I usually lack a shadowpriest and JoW pally, so I just burn down to 20% mana and spam frostbolt until a mana gem or pot comes back, and repeat.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_707289"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Updated with rawr.mage, and i have a few points to disagree with<br>
<br>
Manly: If the object of theorycrafting min/max is to, in the end, use that theorycraft to assist you in killing the boss, then why not take that into consideration?<br>
<br>
Rather, what's the point of discussing letting ignite tick off on a fight like brutallus? Where he's enraged at 3%? Twins? Felmyst? My point is that if it <i>really</i> came down to it, and you're the last dps alive and you can cast one spell to finish him off at 1%, and you have a huge ignite ticking, why not Ice block? Blink away? And if you cant and that's your only spell you can cast, wouldn't fireball be the spell of choice since it does more damage even ignoring ignite?<br>
<br>
The window of saying it's better to cast arcane blast if im the last mage alive (if we're talking about letting ignite tick as fiery veins) if and only if A) I'm the last person alive, so letting ignite tick might be the only way to do enough damage needed to kill him, B) That the damage lost arcane blasting instead of fireballing is enough to kill it, and C) you cannot Ice block, blink, BoP, or any other spell to buy the time to let the ignite tick seems like an awful lot of "If's", with little gain.<br>
<br>
Anyways ignoring the tangent Serpent-braid and hex is the hands down best combo for 40/0/21, especially since it lets you use all the cooldowns at once without going under global.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_707388"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Would like to raise another discussion point.  Because of arcane's new style of play, which is AB spam as much as it is humanely possible. Arcane fares best for fights ranging from 1 min to 4 min or so. (You can comfortably AB with good shammy &amp; SP support plus evoc plus gems+pots up to 4 min).  <br>
<br>
But stacking int/spirit onto gems may lengthen that time at the cost of DPS. Based on Rawr, int/spirit is best. But I question that. I feel that it is all dependent on the fight. For shorter fights where even when gemmed on damage, you won't run oom spamming AB. Then it doesnt make sense to sacrifice DPS by gemming for int/spirit. <br>
<br>
However, for longer fights (which may or may not be that common). Then, gemming for int/spirit allows you to AB that much longer, and it does equate to overal increased DPS when measured over the whole fight.  So, for arcane mages raiding in post 2.4. If there is the luxury, they may want to consider having an altarnate gear set that is gemmed for int/spirit. While having a more standard DPS set for farming/instance and most standard raid boss fights.<br>
<br>
So, for that one or two odd fights in the game which lasts  for 6 minutes or longer, throw on that int/spit gemmed set.  Of course, not every one has that kind of luxury. But some mages who have been farming BT for months probably do.<br>
<br>
Because while gemming for int/spirit may seem to be best for DPS based on Rawr. This is only true if its a long enough fight such that you need that extra mana regen and mana to finish it spamming AB. If you can finish the raid boss fight spamming AB without needing to gem your entire suit with int/spirit. Then, you will achieve higher DPS by gemming for damage.<br>
<br>
So for example. For a 4 minute fight. Perhaps a full out dmg gemmed set will let an arcane mage achieve 2400 DPS spammin AB. For a 6 or 7 minute fight, the same arcane mage will switch to a spirit/int set that allows him to do 2200 DPS by able to AB for most or all of the duration.<br>
<br>
Of course, if your raid is willing to throw all their innervates at you, then just gem for damage cos you won't ever run oom.  <br>
<br>
We must consider that eventually, Sunwell will be a 6 boss fight. Its not going to be just Brutullus. And most BT &amp; Mt Hyjal fights are short. So, it doesn't make as much sense gemming all of your gear for less damage just because you want to be able to AB spam for that one or two long fight. I know most mages are using Brutullas as a benchmark for theorycraft right now. But eventually, when all gates are open, Sunwell won't be defined by just that one fight.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_707505"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hmmm. But let's say its a "short" enough fight such that even gemmed with +dmg gems instead of int/spirit, you can finish the fight spamming AB all the way as well. Yes, you still have to evocate,gem, and pot. But you can spam AB the whole fight without gemming for int/spirit. Then why would it be higher DPS?  <br>
<br>
The frequency of ABs being cast would be the same. But the damage done by the mage with a set gemmed for damage should be higher because his set is gemmed for damage rather than for int/spirit.<br>
<br>
So, for example.  This particular raid boss fight.  It involves the arcane mage casting a total of 40 arcane blasts, eat gem twice, drink mana pot twice, and evocate once. <br>
<br>
Now, assuming that even when gemmed for +dmg, the mage can still spam AB and hence cast that 40 arcane blasts without running out of mana. Then, it should be higher damage right? Cos his average AB will be a higher range than the arcane mage that gemmed for int/spirit.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_707530"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->If by having more int you can use one less tick of evocation that is overall increase in damage. And Fight would have to be ridiculously short that you wouldn't need evocation. If you're really gemmed for dmg it'll be shorter than 1 minute.<br>
<br>
Just do an experiment in Rawr. Select a 1 minute fight and once gem for dmg and then for int and compare total damage. If you get more total damage with dmg gems I'm almost sure you had enough external regen that you didn't even have to evocate.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_707535"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'm a bit uncomfortable with the examples you're using for comparison. Your base example appears to be an ungemmed DPS set, in which you can take down a raid boss without running out of mana (which in itself is unlikely). After this, you compare the dps increase from gemming from +dmg than +int. <br>
<br>
However, the way I see it, broadly speaking for most fights, even if they are "short", it should actually be a comparison between:<br>
<br>
(a) Arcane mage gemmed for +dmg [at cost of mana pool], casting 40 ABs, eat gem x2, drink mana pot x2, evocate<br>
vs<br>
(b) Arcane mage gemmed for +int, casting 40 ABs, Flame Cap x2 (in place of gem CD), destro pot x2, evocate if necessary.<br>
<br>
In these cases, the dps increase doesn't look as obvious for case (a). Besides, any shorter fight and you'd be talking about trash mobs.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_707574"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Most of the encounters in MH/BT are unusually short. Do we have any reason to believe that Brutallus isn't on the short end rather than the long? Kalecgos seems to be 6-7 minutes for most guilds. Felmyst is a 10-minute enrage. The twin eredars, from my initial impressions, are not a short fight. M'uru has at least two phases, which suggests that it's not likely to be over in 4 minutes. And it would surprise me enormously if Kil'Jaeden was not a long encounter.<br>
<br>
To me, Brutallus seems to be about as short an encounter as you're going to get in Sunwell. Of course, several of these fights will become shorter once raids out-gear them, but so what? Presumably progression is our focus, not farming.<br>
<br>
And as has been pointed out, any fight where you have to evocate, int gems will out-do +damage gems. This is because you do not do any damage while evocating. The mage who gems int will cast more blasts than the mage who gems +damage.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yea I'm just imported your profile and set spec to 40/0/21 and it's giving interesting results. It's actually suggesting to use destro pots, molten armor and not using evocation. My guess is that since you don't have 2T5 Arcane Blast is not worth it and apart from some minimal use during cooldown stacking it doesn't even use Arcane Blast. As soon as I equip 2T5 int shoots very high.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

(Briefly - there are no rotations. Keep the AB debuff stacked and cast AB when you have the mana for it and frostbolt when you don't. And deep fire is entirely competitive with and certainly easier and less demanding of raid synergies than arcane. It will out-damage arcane on longer fights.)</div>

</div>I'm not saying use rotation all the time. I said ab spam till oom and then use 3*fb + 1*ab. Its better dps and dpm than frostbolt spam.<br>
<br>
Using <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080415185342/http://www.manoutoftime.org/staticpages/index.php/tcom" target="_blank">Man Out of Time - Theorycraft-o-Matic</a><br>
3,451.60 damage per Arcane Blast / single cast <br>
Manacost  195*1.2 = 234<br>
With one debuff dps is 3451.6 / (2.5 -0.334) = 1593.53dps<br>
<br>
3,705.13 damage per Frostbolt (2.50 seconds)<br>
Manacost 330 * 0.85 = 280.5<br>
DPS 3705.13 /2.5 = 1482.052<br>
<br>
So clearly 3*fb + 1*ab is better than frostbolt spam. Both mana and dps.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_709106"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Well, I was accounting for switching to T5 Helm and Shoulders (unfortunately I skipped over all of t5 so I will have to go back and get it), and even though intellect shoots up, the other gems were still slightly better.  Socketing for int wasn't hurting me that much (like I said, it was like 5 dps difference overall), but nonetheless I thought it was strange.<br>
<br>
<br>
I am also curious about the rotation as well.  Everyone here is saying you should AB spam, then frostbolt until you get some mana back (generally till you can potion?) and then AB spam again.  To me it seems like you will be loosing DPS by using just frostbolt, as opposed to a rotation with AB in it.  Rawr seems to agree, telling me to AB spam, then use (ABFrB)x3FrBx2.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Using my current T6 gear and a brutallus fight/party/buff (fire+IV) setting with Skull as 2nd trinket, it looks like this for the 1st trinket slot:<br>
Hex - 91, (Skull - 89; it's unique), MotChamp - 84, DMCrus - 79, Quag's - 71, Icon - 70, Sextant - 68, Mag's Eye - 60<br>
<br>
Using a non-clicky trinket in slot 2 (47 dmg PvP trinket) and stealing some spell hit elsewhere (JC ring, to cap), it looks like this for slot 1:<br>
Hex - 96, Skull - 94, MotChamp - 82, DMCrus - 77, Icon - 74, Quag's - 70, Sextant - 66, Mag's Eye - 59<br>
<br>
<br>
So, the first clicky trinket you equip performs like 4-6 damage better than average from stacking cooldowns.<br>
Thus, while noticable, the difference isn't as big as one might have expected it. It is slight shift in favour of static trinkets, but it doesn't change the rank of trinkets unless they were about equal to begin with.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

-&gt; I made an open challenge to anyone to work out the math comparing whether you are better off unstacking IV and bloodlust for the express purpose of being able to spam AB during hightened DPS/DPM times. You can frostbolt with bloodlust and IV stacked, but you fall below the 1s GCD, which is why I proposed someone to check out the math, so that you could continue AB spammage during both bloodlust and IV provided that they are not stacked. Personally my gut feeling says you're better off not stacking them, but its nothing scientific by any means. The math behind it is quite involved to say the least.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>I thought a bit about this question and I think I've got at least a reasonable answer, the way I like to go about stuff like this is instead of figuring out damage per 1 spellcast on average after taking crit and stuff, I calculate on a 60 or 120 second basis and that helps me figure out numbers when there are different buffs with different timers and stuff like that involved...heres how I would work it.<br>
<br>
So with IV/BL together I'd see how many spellcasts of frostbolt I'd get with them both stacked, then count the AB casts with bloodlust left over and then just however many AB casts would be left over at the end. Compare those numbers with how many AB casts you get with bloodlust and icy veins chained one after another, divided by 60 (presuming we're counting for only 1 minute) and compare their DPS. These numbers are presuming there is 0 spell haste involved, if there were it wouldnt be too hard to recalculate the denominators by each number after spell haste is taken into account to determine how often spells are cast.<br>
<br>
20/1.25*Frostbolt+20/1.05*AB+20/1.5*AB=Damage with both stacked<br>
<br>
40/1.05*AB+20/1.2*AB=Damage with IV and BL one after another<br>
<br>
If I were to put in numbers (taken from vontres spreadsheet) it looks like I'd get this...<br>
<br>
20/1.25*1212+20/1.05*1607+20/1.5*1607=71428.19048<br>
<br>
<br>
40/1.05*1607+20/1.2*1607=88002.38095<br>
<br>
Obviously there are a few things missing from this, A) it doesnt take into account haste, with different haste ratings the frostbolts and arcane blasts per period would fluctuate, I can rewrite the equations to include haste however if it looks like the theory is on track. B) It doesnt take into account your current mana pool, lets say for example the shaman puts bloodlust on and you dont think you can sustain 1 minute of ABs with what mana you have left and that increased casting rate, you would then probably want to start frostbolt spamming even though its worse DPS simply because you wont run out of mana by the end of it and thus have potentially better DPS than the arcane variation. I think if that were necessary I could run a calculation by figuring out how much net mana each method would use up and after taking mana regen and stuff into account how much mana is available for the 60 second period. C) I dont think trinkets are figured into that equation, after they are thrown in there I would imagine that the frost DPS would look better than it does now in comparison to the AB version, I have no numbers to back that theory up though.<br>
<br>
Anyway...thats pretty much that, what do you all think?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The changes to Arcane Meditation and Spirit mechanics make mage armor invaluable. I was old-school arcane before patch 2.3 (3 AB 1 AM 1 scorch spec 47/11/3) and after the patch changes, 373 mp5 is where I sit with only my current gear level in raid buffs. Remember the purpose of switching to frostbolt spam is to allow you to regenerate mana quickly.<br>
<br>
With mage armor on, not only is your AB spam time extended but your frostbolt time is truncated  to keep you on the high dps side.  If you look at the mana cost of frostbolt: 272 mana per cast (with frost channeling and 2 casts per 5seconds assuming no haste in this model) that's -544 mp5 while you regenerate well over half of that factor on your own mana regeneration alone.  If you chain mana pot as you should, your mana regen is increased by 1800 - 3000 mp120 seconds = 75 - 125 mp5 and if you chain gem as well your mana is increased by approximately 120 mp5 (assuming you have serpent coil braid) this brings my self-sufficient mp5 for the first 6 minutes of a fight to 373 + 120 + 75 (assuming worst potion luck) = 568 mp5.<br>
<br>
With mage armor on, I can regenerate mana without reliance on a shadow priest or shaman totems while spamming frostbolt at approximately 24 mp5 while still dpsing the boss.  Any mana incoming from your shadow priest and shaman (assuming you are in range of mana stream totem) are pure profit on top of your own self-sufficience, and you could refill your mana bar remarkably fast to return to AB spamming it back down.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">The fact that Skull doesn't stack anymore with other trinkets really interests me in what would be the best trinket combo in game now.  I see on the armory that Manly still has the Skull/Hex combo, but is the use of Serpent-Coil Braid at the cost of a Flame Cap worth it to have the haste and extra damage at the same time?  Also, assuming the use of Skull/Hex still, would it be better to use Skull during IV or use it after IV+Hex?<br>
<br>
Last thing, while looking at some of the Nihilum mages on the armory i saw Darmor with a not so textbook spec.<br>

		<div id="post_message_711336"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->We're on our third-ish night of full attempts on them, and I do see the merits of 0/40/21. It's not just double IB, which is almost worth it by itself, but double IV with Pyrogenics active is a lot of DPS, particularly given the first 3min (when you'd have double IV active) is the most crucial. New raid week incoming, but I think I might try once we're through Felmyst again.<br>
<br>
As far as DPS lost... I'd do it with one point out of Playing with Fire, one point out of Emp. Fireball. Assuming 1600-ish damage raid buffed, that's -1% damage done and -3% of the coefficient from Fireball, or about 50 spell damage. As I mentioned though, double IV with Pyrogenics should easily overcome that. It would be a DPS loss for P2, but given that P2 is the easy (ish, anyway) part of the fight, the damage loss wouldn't be especially relevant.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">This is obviously assuming the fight is short enough (as in you have enough mana) for AB rotations to never make you go oom when used alone (no AB spamming and no frostbolts) - otherwise you'd have to compare rotations+frostbolts to spamming+frostbolts instead (in a similar manner) - but as far as I know this never happens seeing the AB spam uptime people keep up.</div>

</div>In regards to AB spam uptime I have to admit I've just started playing with 40/0/21 this week out of curiousity (just reverting from 47/11/3). I noticed that in alot of fights I took part in through Hyjal and BT last night my AB uptime was very high.<br>
<br>
Here's a WWS parse from Az'galor and please ignore the dps, that's not the important part here, my gear isn't where I want it to be yet, the purpose is that if you look at my spells used during the fight you'll note that the majority of casts (95% actually) were arcane blast despite the mana consumption.  My group build for tonight was me + 1 other arcane mage, 1 holy pally (conc aura was nice I guess...), 1 ele shaman, and 1 shadow priest.<br>
<br>
Az'galor <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080421231947/http://wowwebstats.com/p6irkr55qmwqg?s=8568-8898" target="_blank">WWS Loading...</a><br>
<br>
I realise that Az'galor has periods of down time for us shorter ranged dps during which I had some pretty good mana regen.  Most fights I've had so far have been skewed toward arcane in terms of mana regen breaks (Supremus and Najentus were great ones for instance with nice regen breaks between high DPS periods <br>
<br>

<br>
Later this week when I see Illidan I should have a good assessment of more facets of the spec but so far I find it at least as fun as 47/11/3.  I'd like to see it once I have more gear.<br>
<br>
BTW this spec is not for those who are short on cash, I blew 24 super mana potions in tonights raid chain potting to keep the AB spam up, but I'm used to farming about 100 a week in my older arcane spec =).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Well, I was accounting for switching to T5 Helm and Shoulders (unfortunately I skipped over all of t5 so I will have to go back and get it), and even though intellect shoots up, the other gems were still slightly better.  Socketing for int wasn't hurting me that much (like I said, it was like 5 dps difference overall), but nonetheless I thought it was strange.<br>
<br>
<br>
I am also curious about the rotation as well.  Everyone here is saying you should AB spam, then frostbolt until you get some mana back (generally till you can potion?) and then AB spam again.  To me it seems like you will be loosing DPS by using just frostbolt, as opposed to a rotation with AB in it.  Rawr seems to agree, telling me to AB spam, then use (ABFrB)x3FrBx2.</div>

</div>     Well actually one may not necessarily put the 3x FB 1x AB rotation into use due to one of my favorite features of the 40/0/21 spec: Haste.  Untimely heroisms might make the rotation counting too complicated and it may be more benificial to simply spam frostbolt.<br>
<br>
     Spell haste isn't really that awful for arcane anymore if you get into 40/0/21 you would cap out (hit 1.0s AB) at approx 263 haste rating with IV up.  You could lower this imaginary "cap" if you wanted to account for Bloodlust/Heroism as your 1.0s AB mark.  The only "bad" part about the haste is that it is a percentage gain and short cast spells (3 debuff arcane blast spam) get less of a cast time reduction than long cast spells (fireball).  On the other hand, with 263 haste rating you will hit 1.0 seconds on arcane blast while using IV, which I find somewhat enticing in regards to experimentation.  Ultimately with enough of the new T6 pieces and offset sunwell gear one could hit that "cap" reasonably without nerfing too many other stats.<br>
<br>
     Rigid rotations lose the benefit of dynamism, while the most enjoyable and powerful thing about the arcane spec is the challenge of managing your mana to hit 0% when the boss hits 0% and also to be able to mana dump when it's time to crank out massive DPS in a short amount of time.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Neither of the rotations we were discussing involved casting 2 ABs in succession, so this isn't a concern at all.<br>
<br>
As far as haste's effect, that would definately cause a small problem.  I believe you will start running into trouble when you achieve aboive 160 haste rating (~10% haste) because then 3 FrBs and 1 AB will be less than the 8 second debuff.  You could, however, begin throwing in a scorch at the end of the 3xFrB and then AB after that, and I think that would fix it, and that seems like it would still likely be better than simply frostbolt spamming while keeping AB stacked until your mana is higher.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_713717"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'm a relatively poorly geared mage. Some Kara/Gruul/Mag gear, and a piece or two from TK and SSC, where my guild is in progression.<br>
<br>
One thing I noticed is that I had a much harder time keeping mana up than most TCers discuss... with lower int/spi due to poorer gear, and usually no Shadow priest (we have only one Spriest, and the healers get it). After the first time we did Solarian, and my horrible ability to keep mana up, I took another look at my spec (which was 10/0/51 at the time). I went up through the frost tree picking only DPS talents, with very little mitigation or CC. That left me 19 points for Arcane, to get 3/3 Meditation (and a bit more). So my new spec (available from the armory link to the left) is 19/0/42, and if we are to believe Rawr.Mage, it's better than any of the standard specs for my current gear.<br>
<br>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080421231947im_/http://www.dotnet.com/~myrddin/images/Rawr.MageComparison.png" border="0" alt=""><br>
<br>
That is despite me wearing <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30673" target="_blank">[Inferno Waist Cord]</a> on a frost spec! (yes, I have no better... waiting for the armorer to be unlocked on my server). With a more frost-appropriate waist, the difference is even more notable.<br>
<br>
So my whole point is that perhaps this spec, or a similar one based on 18/0/41+2, should be recommended for pre-T5 gearing? It's mana efficiency is tremendous, which is important when you're in older gear and lacking a Spriest. Though, even if I give myself a 150mp5 shadowpriest, Rawr.Mage still shows this spec as best, with my current gear.<br>
<br>
Is this a failure of the Rawr.Mage TC, or is this a valid spec?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

This doesn't mean you should use this spec, but rather means you need to fix your gear. You have an enourmous amount of available upgrades that can be achieved without stepping foot in a raid instance (and some without stepping foot in *any* instance for that matter). Heck your weapon and bracers are enchanted with intelect... Fixing your gear will up your dps with *any* spec by a considerable amount, and probably help fire spec dps more than it helps frost making you better as fire once your gear is fixed.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Actually, I have it set for 600 second fights (which is pretty normal for us, since we're still progressing, and everyone is undergeared... we're fighting the enrage timer on some bosses, like Void Walker). I'm well aware that frost spec is overvalued for any fight close to the 90 second mark (2xFrost Elementals).<br>
<br>
I can get better gear for several slots... but that does not mean the spec is useless. At some point, no matter where you are, you're gonna be passing through about my level of gear... whether you've got thousands of gold to burn on mats, patterns, and primals, or whether you're entering Kara for the first time on progression with your guild... at some point, you're gear is going to suck, and I think this spec is a notable improvement over the standard specs that are listed.<br>
<br>
That said, let me put some better gear on in Rawr... replaced my weapon, bracers, and belt with badge gear (of which I'm actually about 80 badges short to get all 3)... put on my Kara chest <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28602" target="_blank">[Robe of the Elder Scribes]</a> (which I normally don't wear because I need the +hit and haven't spent the cash to buy all the <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=31867" target="_blank">[Veiled Noble Topaz]</a> I'd need to make up for it), and pretended I ran Heroic Slave pens until <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=27683" target="_blank">[Quagmirran's Eye]</a> dropped, then had Rawr regem me with rare gems using Optimize... and my spec is still higher DPS than the standard ones.<br>
<br>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080421231947im_/http://www.dotnet.com/~myrddin/images/Rawr.MageComparison2.png" border="0" alt=""><br>
<br>
So with all my gear pretty good for my current progression, 18/0/41+2 is still doing very well for me... as long as you trust Rawr. This is without a Spriest, but assuming raid buffs of course. Even if I add a 125mp5 Shadowpriest the spec remains tops in Rawr.<br>
<br>
This is either a valid point that this spec is worthwhile and valuable for pre-T5 geared mages, or it's indicating a significant flaw in Rawr's TC. Perhaps someone who is better with the numbers could validate it?<br>
<br>
Edit: Try this... outfit a mage with all T4 level gear... full T4 set, badge loot (bought with all the Kara/Gruul/Mags runs needed to get a full set), and whatever heroic items you think will fill it out. Top it off with whatever rare gems you like. And see if 18/0/41+2 does better DPS. So far, I've been playing with it, and I'm still finding it coming out on top.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>That does explain something. You should reduce that time, or reduce the DPS time from 1 to 0.75 perhaps.<br>
<br>
With some T4 gear, no SP and 10 minutes straight nuking, Fire/IV has 3 minutes of AFKWanding, Fire/CC has 2 minutes. Frost/CC has 90s and Frost/Medi still has 65 seconds of wanding.<br>
<br>
For total damage done, it's Fire/IV &lt; Frost/CC &lt; Fire/CC &lt; Frost/Medi in that gear.<br>
With a 10 minute/no outside mana fight, a mage is pretty screwed due to mana.<br>
<br>
Most fights that take so long in T5 also have some downtime during encounters. Hydross/Leotheras/Lurkeer transitions, Void Reaver/Al'ar/Lurker/Karathress/Morogrim running.<br>
When I reduce the DPS time to 0.75 (75% of the fight), fire pulls ahead again because the mana is there to actually fight.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_714180"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Yeah there is no fight in the game that I know that can last 10 minutes and above while maintaining 100% DPS uptime, no matter how much mana you have - bosses would simply die way before the 10 minute mark if you actually had 100% DPS uptime. So yeah if you're going to model 10 minute fights model much lower DPS uptime. Like said above, it's probably modeling you going so deeply oom and wanding that the mana efficiency of water elemental (which is very high DPM but on a cooldown) becomes a significant DPS increase. Of course if you'd model a reaslistic scenario (shorter fight or lower DPS uptime), you'll find the water elemental's DPM a lot less valueable.<br>
<br>
As for the gear, a dedicated player will probably not even zone in to a raid instance (with possible exception of kara which is extremely easy and is a badge farming source) with that kind of gear, as he'll easily get the better gear. Farming a couple thousand gold doesn't take all that long (to be honest, farming DKP and learning bosses with a raid that takes people with that kind of gearing mentality  takes a lot lot longer and gives inferior gear).<br>
<br>
On a side note, the effective damage from the proc on robes of the elder scribes added to its base stats is still not really enough to even color it purple...<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

But you're not really going oom in any real fight so in reality the mana efficiency of frostbolts+elemental is rather similar to the mana efficiency of fireballs, with fireballs unloading that damage faster and therefore being better (on any fight that is long enough for double elemental+IV to not be good enough).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I don't really think it's a flaw in my usage... it's highlighting an important point. For progression, with lesser gear, mana efficiency is more important than any other stat.<br>
<br>
When we fought Void Reaver, I had a total of 12 OO5SR ticks the entire fight. I don't stop DPSing, and when a bomb is falling on me, I usually blink out. My DPS over the course of the fight was much higher with this spec than with my previous 10/0/51.<br>
<br>
Now, I'll admit that TK helps highlight the benefits of this spec... there's a lot of AOE, and 18 points in Arcane lets me buff up my AE. Void Reaver (for us) is a long fight, where I'm burning mana the whole time. Solarian is also a mana intensive fight, despite the short breaks before AoE waves. And Al'ar (who we haven't touched yet) is hostile to fire specs. So overall, it's pretty much ideal for this spec.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying that this spec is better at DPS than the standard specs everyone knows... I'm saying that its mana efficiency is so high that it highlights an important gap in the specs... a gap that really should be filled, and has an important purpose, that of allowing lesser geared mages to continue DPS an entire fight while progressing through T5 content. I think there are a lot of mages out there that look to EJ as gospel truth and follow all the recommendations here. They're using the given specs and not realizing that if they traded off some raw DPS for mana efficiency, they'd make up for it by quaffing destro pots instead of mana... by DPSing instead of Evocating.<br>

If I model Brut with my target endgame sunwell gear and assume Brut kill time drops to 5 mins (reasonable assuming a decked out sunwell raid), the DPS improvement of 0/40/21 over 2/48/11 is 36 dps.

But you'll still do more DPS as fire. Remember to use gems and pots as soon and as often as possible and only blink when it's the only way to avoid death - the mana cost is probably not worth the time saving (the time you save by blinking in practice is very small), unless you're already not going oom while using destruction potions and flame caps and not evocating, which obviously isn't the case for you. Anyway you'll most likely do quite better with fire, it's simply a more powerful spec for most encounters in game.<br>
<br>
Even for solarian AOE the mobs die so fast the extra regen is probably not worth losing blastwave, and shatter CoC had already been shown to be a waste of a global cooldown on frost nova, not to mention you can't really get shatter with a pve frost spec without making noticeable sacrifices.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I do appreciate the offer Austin, thank you. As far as the belt... I'll get it sometime, but that's a hell of a lot of effort for 20dps (the difference between a belt of blasting and the badge belt). I'll be able to get the badge belt later this week, and that'll be enough of an upgrade for the near future. And I'm working on the mats for shadoweave, but I'm not gonna bother until I get more T4 pieces... the T4p2 bonus is far too worthwhile to give up.<br>
<br>
But there's still something that concerns me... you're all discussing how to spend thousands of gold (or equivalent farming time) in order to gear past the point where this spec is valuable... long fights (progression) in underpowered gear. Maybe it's been so long that you don't remember what progression is like? This is my first 70... I don't have thousands of gold lying around. I don't have time to farm thousands of gold... except for raid nights, I mostly quest with my mother (who is retired). I have a job, and a wife who doesn't appreciate it if I ignore her. ;-)<br>
<br>
My point is that throwing money (and asking someone to buy multi-thousand-gold worth of purple crafted items is throwing money) at a problem isn't necessarily the best fix. A different spec is a hell of a lot cheaper, and if it nets me good DPS (and I'm always somewhere between 2nd and 4th in my raid), I really don't see the sense in killing myself for incrementally better gear... that's why I'm raiding!<br>
<br>
-----<br>
<br>
My claim is that at 600 int, 300 spi, and about +1200 damage raid buffed, 18/0/42+1 is a better progression spec (long fights where everyone is in similar level gear) for TK and SSC than any of the other specs listed. Talk about that. Show me why I'm wrong, or where Rawr is wrong. Show me with numbers... I've already shown my numbers. But don't just tell me I'm wrong without offering some minimal TC to back it up. And don't tell me my gear is shit... I know it. The discussion isn't about the gear, it's about a spec that may be better for people in lower gear. Everyone has to pass through it at some point, and not everyone has a guild that can coddle a shitty player, carrying their sorry asses through Kara Grrul and Mags a dozen times till they have better gear... I'm trying to ask if anyone cane show (with numbers) why this spec is inferior at this gear level. Not for people to tell me how I can get better gear... I posted this in a TC thread, not in Help Me Please.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

The issue I have with your claim is that 600 seconds (10 minutes) is normal for a fight at that gear level, especially now. For void reaver, this means your raid wide DPS is less than 8000. Given that Rawr says, for your gear, that you will do aproximately 980 DPS to Void Reaver for the entirety of the 600 second fight, there's about 7000 more DPS to make up. Let's assume that there are 7 other DPS geared on par with you. They should all be putting out similar numbers. So, with 8 DPS (Yourself + 7 similarly geared people) you should be able to kill void reaver exactly at the enrage timer of ten minutes.<br>
<br>
My point here is simple: your raid is clearly not pulling its weight if 8K rDPS is considered normal for a 25man raid. In my above example of 8 DPSers at your level, there are 17 other slots. We'll assume 4 tanks because that seems to be a ridiculous number. I'm going to use the four tanks' DPS to "balance out" the rDPS to exactly 8K, since you do about 20 short of 1K according to rawr. Four tanks should cover 20 * 8 (160) DPS handily, with change. (One tank could cover that.) This means there are 13 (25-8-4) slots left over that are doing absolutely no damage in this theoretical raid. I think you can see where I'm going with this, but...<br>
<br>
It would appear that your guild is not pulling its weight in 25mans if it truly takes you 10 minutes to do void reaver.<br>
<br>
[Edit: The reason I brought your assumption of a 600 second fight is... from 520 seconds on downwards, other specs beat yours. To get a kill in this time requires approximately 9.2K rDPS]<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_715965"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hey there MyrddinE,<br>
<br>
I think most readers understand your point and it is something noteworthy to bring up. Although as one person mentioned earlier the fight must go for a very long duration for you to obtain any real substantial advantage. <br>
<br>
Most fights in ssc/tk you will not be seeing this 18/0/42 +1 spec outdoing deep fire / IV. No i do not have numbers (my wws reports are now expired) though my total dmg on fights which i have gone oom for over a minute i still managed to out dmg other fellow mages who have followed your current theory by over 100K dmg. Now unless your talking about doing vashj, or even more so kael in blues and random epics, i think my result would stick.<br>
<br>
TBH i dont believe anyone here NEEDS to show you numbers, the numbers are there already in all the respectable spreadsheets and dmg tables. You should go plug some numbers with your gear, gemd with the 'EJ gospel' advice, and im just about certain you will see everything right there.<br>
<br>
With my last spellfire/spellstrike gear, i only went oom after 7 minutes in most fights including aoe encounters. karazhan/gruuls are very short encounters.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The reason, as outlined by others earlier in the thread, is that a 10 minute fight with zero-downtime is a very unrealistic model for any SSC/TK fight. Most fights in SSC or TK have a 10 minute enrage so that is a reasonable upper bound, but none of these fights consist of 100% dps time. Some examples: for Hydross, there is downtime every frost-&gt;nature, nature-&gt;frost transition, and further downtime if ice-tombed. For Leo, every whirlwind and elf-&gt;demon, demon-&gt;elf transition. For VR, every time you are targetted by an orb and have to run away is regeneration time. Even fights without aggro wipes like FLK involve running and retargetting (totems as well as adds).<br>

I think there are a lot of mages out there that look to EJ as gospel truth and follow all the recommendations here. They're using the given specs and not realizing that if they traded off some raw DPS for mana efficiency, they'd make up for it by quaffing destro pots instead of mana... by DPSing instead of Evocating.</div>

</div><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080421235252/http://elitistjerks.com/658230-post3191.html" target="_blank">Roywyn did a very handy analysis</a> that calculates the trade-off value for most if not all mana recovery options - the best trade-off are using mana pots, gems (if fire-spec, otherwise a non-issue) and evocation, with mage armor/respeccing for arcane meditation somewhat worse (although obviously this depends on your spirit/intellect totals). Although mage armor is technically a worse dps tradeoff than arcane meditation, it does have the benefit of being available regardless of spec, affording greater flexibility to higher DPS/lower DPM specs - they can excel on shorter fights and still perform decently on long ones simply by switching armor types.<br>
<br>
If, after using pots, gems et al you still end up OOM on a regular basis then yes, respeccing to include arcane meditation will be a net dps increase. I don't think anyone here would dispute that.<br>
<br>
However, given that many (most?) T5 progressing mages make do without it, I think that either raid composition or group make-up (not enough paladins, no (i)DS priest, no resto/elemental shaman or shadow priest in group) is more likely to be the root of the issue.<br>

</div>Here are some numbers, assume zero haste, 10k mana pool:<br>
<br>
Rank 14 Frostbolt spam (accounting for EP/Frost Channeling): -114 mps<br>
<br>
Super mana pots: +20mps<br>
Gems (reconjure cost is ~ -4.5mps (1670 per 6min), but during this time you aren't frost bolting, so I will approximate as -4mps: +20mps - 4mps = +16mps<br>
Evocate: +14mps (6000 mana per 8min)<br>
Mage armor: +15 - 20mps (depends on your spirit and intellect scores when raid buffed)<br>
<br>
Crappy shadow priest doing 500dps: +25mps<br>
Decent shadow priest doing 800dps: +40mps<br>
Shaman mana spring: +10mps<br>
Resto shaman mana tide: +17mps (3000 mana ever 3min)<br>
BoW: +8mps<br>
BoK: Again depends on your total int/spi and affects many other mana sources (evo, tide, mage armor), but let's estimate at +10mps.<br>
<br>
Total net regen with no group buff support, but full pot/gem/evo/MA use: -49mps (oom in 205 seconds - 3.5 minutes).<br>
Total net regen with the above and BoW, BoK and a crappy shadow priest: -6mps (oom in 1667 seconds - 27 minutes).<br>
Total net regen with the above but a resto shaman instead of a shadow priest: -22mps (oom in 454 seconds - 7.5 minutes).<br>
<br>
If you have a good shadow priest or both a shadow priest and a shaman then your regen becomes positive and you can start switching to molten armor/ditching evocate etc.<br>
<br>
Of course on a real fight you will use IV/other spells than frostbolt, your shaman won't always have their totems down or pop mana tide every time it's up, and VT uptime will often be less than 100% - but this is offset to a greater or lesser degree by movement time, latency, and encounter gimmicks.<br>
<br>
TL;DR: With no group support in a tank-n-spank fight a 18/0/43 build is optimal; but with only minimal support arcane meditation quickly becomes superfluous.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_716013"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'd like to inquire about the value of Spell Haste for Arcane. This has been touched on in this thread, and though I looked through the 2.3 thread I didn't find any posts about it. With the release of <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=35761" target="_blank">[Quick Lionseye]</a>s, the comparison of spell haste to damage has become pretty relevant.<br>
<br>
 The Arcane spec is built around being able to spend all of your mana throughout an encounter. Playing it correctly involves spending all of your mana, while maximizing DPM over the course of the entire fight. Although haste will cause you to spend your mana faster and therefore force you to cast Frostbolt more often, I think that the resultant increase in DPM may outweigh the decrease from your spells hitting softer (A good analog is thinking of spell haste as an increase to the length of the fight). Plugging numbers into RAWR hasn't really given me a clear answer, only showing a 1.5 DPS difference between a Runed Spinel and a Lionseye in favor of the Spinel over a five minute fight.<br>

		<div id="post_message_716017"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->So it was mentioned somewhere in the 2.3 mage TC thread that pairing Icon/Hex with Combustion is a greater gain than pairing Skull with Combustion. But what I've been trying to cope with the fact that there still is that thread about rolling ignites, are they still around and worth any more time on?<br>
<br>
The basis of this post is to find out the best way to force(?) rolling ignites to happen more often, when the difference in cooldown popping to passive haste on gear effects change. Can use Brutallus as the encounter in question to provide timing and such.<br>
<br>
For those of you who never read the rolling ignites thread, or forgot the basics of it, the general assumption was that in order for you to get rolling ignites to happen, you needed to have finished a cast on a Fireball <i>while</i> your previous Fireball was still in the air. This occurs at about max range with ~2sec casts, varies depending upon latency.<br>
<br>
I wouldn't go into such a detailed explanation before any numbers came, but since I'm a Troll, I have a problem with how to compute Berserking properly into a rotation since it can change the outcome of some effects as much as the difference of a Skull can.<br>
<br>
Using 0 passive haste:<br>
Berserking(10%)+IV+Skull: 2.05s Fireballs<br>
Berserking(20%)+IV+Skull: 1.85s Fireballs<br>
Berserking(20%)+IV: ~2.08s Fireballs<br>
IV+Skull: 2.25s Fireballs<br>
<br>
Using 59 passive haste rating: Bracers and BT trash ring<br>
Berserking(10%)+IV+Skull: 1.98s Fireballs<br>
Berserking(20%)+IV+Skull: 1.78s Fireballs<br>
Berserking(20%)+IV: ~2.0s Fireballs<br>
IV+Skull: 2.18s Fireballs<br>
<br>
Typically on Brutallus, I get the 2nd soak group position, and can reliably get a 20% Berserking buff. So using those numbers, the closest to rolling ignites I can get is when I pop Berserking+IV together, using Icon/Hex paired,  and use Skull after. That's all fine and dandy for round 1, but round 2 at 20%, do I selectively pop everything seperate in order to pair Bloodlust as close as I can to get a 2s cast? Or do I follow the same order even with Bloodlust and lose all possibility of rolling ignites?<br>
<br>
Even rolling one ignite, no matter how little is still a dps gain over not rolling an ignite.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>You say arcane spec has not been looked at from a haste perspective and you are wrong. It has been examined and has been found seriously flawed. You mistakenly quote a DPM increase using haste, this is clearly not the case. If like Galzohar you examine DPM in a damage-per-mana-intake-minus-spent rather than damage-per-mana-spent perspective,(ie, taking into account any regen sources) it's a clear DPM drop. In the best case scenario it neither increases nor decreases but that is merely a flaw in terms of calculating: Your overall <i>mana expenditure </i>will be more, even if it stays at the same efficiency. Your mana input however will be <i>the same</i>. As arcane you do not need the help of Haste to increase your burn rate, you can do that just fine and with a lot more control by cycle variation.<br>
<br>
There is no good reason to gem haste rather than either damage or intellect in arcane, and BL-IV making AB 0.96sec cast is bad enough and practically reason enough to either not IV during BL or swap to a non-AB spam.<br>
<br>
Your claim that haste effectively increases fight length is only partially true: it is a fair approximation in terms of your output, however your intake is not modified in the slightest. Your mp5 from spirit will not increase, your mp5 from SP will not increase, and your flat mp5 from mana spring and BoW will not change, it will be exactly the same as it would have been had you gemmed/geared for Runed Spinel. In fact, it will be even less than if you gemmed for Int/Spi.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">So it was mentioned somewhere in the 2.3 mage TC thread that pairing Icon/Hex with Combustion is a greater gain than pairing Skull with Combustion. But what I've been trying to cope with the fact that there still is that thread about rolling ignites, are they still around and worth any more time on?<br>
<br>
The basis of this post is to find out the best way to force(?) rolling ignites to happen more often, when the difference in cooldown popping to passive haste on gear effects change. Can use Brutallus as the encounter in question to provide timing and such.<br>
<br>
For those of you who never read the rolling ignites thread, or forgot the basics of it, the general assumption was that in order for you to get rolling ignites to happen, you needed to have finished a cast on a Fireball <i>while</i> your previous Fireball was still in the air. This occurs at about max range with ~2sec casts, varies depending upon latency.<br>
<br>
I wouldn't go into such a detailed explanation before any numbers came, but since I'm a Troll, I have a problem with how to compute Berserking properly into a rotation since it can change the outcome of some effects as much as the difference of a Skull can.<br>
<br>
Using 0 passive haste:<br>
Berserking(10%)+IV+Skull: 2.05s Fireballs<br>
Berserking(20%)+IV+Skull: 1.85s Fireballs<br>
Berserking(20%)+IV: ~2.08s Fireballs<br>
IV+Skull: 2.25s Fireballs<br>
<br>
Using 59 passive haste rating: Bracers and BT trash ring<br>
Berserking(10%)+IV+Skull: 1.98s Fireballs<br>
Berserking(20%)+IV+Skull: 1.78s Fireballs<br>
Berserking(20%)+IV: ~2.0s Fireballs<br>
IV+Skull: 2.18s Fireballs<br>
<br>
Typically on Brutallus, I get the 2nd soak group position, and can reliably get a 20% Berserking buff. So using those numbers, the closest to rolling ignites I can get is when I pop Berserking+IV together, using Icon/Hex paired,  and use Skull after. That's all fine and dandy for round 1, but round 2 at 20%, do I selectively pop everything seperate in order to pair Bloodlust as close as I can to get a 2s cast? Or do I follow the same order even with Bloodlust and lose all possibility of rolling ignites?<br>
<br>
Even rolling one ignite, no matter how little is still a dps gain over not rolling an ignite.</div>

	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>That's not quite what I tried to illustrate in the rolling ignite thread. In fact, I expect the case of 'fireball ends casting during another fireball being mid-air' to give a case of lost ignite. What I said is that you want your fireballs to be mid-air during the time an ignite tick happens. Try to think of it this way:<br>
<br>
You cast fireball. At the time that you finish casting fireball, you had a 1000 dmg rolling ignite left to tick, on which you add 400 dmg from the current fireball. So once the 'fireball' bolt will land, that bolt will erase whatever ignite was in there and overwrite it with a 1400 dmg ignite to be split in 2 ticks over 4s. In other words, if you cast a fireblast before it lands, then that fireblast will apply say a 1200 ignite total (1000+200). So you get a 1000 ignite, then fireblast lands first, overwriting the ignite with 1200 ignite, then fireball lands, overwriting ignite with 1400 ignite (instead of the expected 1600).<br>
<br>
With this said, I fear your strategy will not last too long for as long as you stay in the 2nd soak group. The better your gear gets, the closer you move to 5min (or shorter obviously). If you use the strat outlined above, you will be gutting yourself out of a set of 2min cooldowns. But ignoring that small detail, credit where credit is due, I like the idea. So lets dig a bit. Here would be my take at it.<br>
<br>
Sadly, I made the choice 3 years ago to roll an undead 'because it looked cool' which means I get to pay a tax and not get my rightful berserking. So berserking is out. So using my current gear as reference;<br>
<br>
(base - 217 / 13.82%)<br>
fireball = 2.64s<br>
fireball + IV = 2.19s<br>
fireball + bloodlust = <b>2.03s</b><br>
fireball + IV + bloodlust = 1.69s<br>
<br>
(base + drums - 297 / 18.92%)<br>
fireball = 2.52s<br>
fireball + IV = <b>2.10s</b> (borderline case)<br>
fireball + bloodlust = 1.94s<br>
fireball + IV + bloodlust = 1.62s<br>
<br>
(base + skull - 392 / 24.97%)<br>
fireball = 2.40s<br>
fireball + IV = <b>2.00s</b><br>
fireball + bloodlust = 1.85s<br>
fireball + IV + bloodlust = 1.54s<br>
<br>
(base + skull + drums - 472 / 30.06%)<br>
fireball = 2.31s<br>
fireball + IV = 1.92s<br>
fireball + bloodlust = 1.77s<br>
fireball + IV + bloodlust = 1.48s<br>
<br>
So this means, in other words, that only 3 of those cases can be used. The practical implications of this are somewhat annoying as it requires a reworking of rotations (assuming of course the benefits of rolling ignite outdoes the loss of doing slightly suboptimal cooldown stacking). This means, in other words, those are the cases we <i>want</i>;<br>

3- &lt;*&gt; skull     &lt; &gt; bloodlust     &lt;*&gt; icy veins    &lt; &gt; drums</pre>
</div>Problems with those: <br>
-case 1 is not realistic. how are you going to get a bloodlust alone and not stack anything with it? I mean, if you assume the theory works and that you can reliably get rolling ignites, then even so it does'nt work. By memory, with 40% base crit rate, and 2s fireballs, if the rolling ignites always roll you get an average 20-25% increased dps from rolling ignites alone. But in revenge you cant stack anything with bloodlust (ie: no IV, no skull, no drums). It strikes me as not realistic at all. Maybe if you get 2 lust on execute range and your brutallus kill is like 6:30 or something.<br>
<br>
-case 2 gives 2.10s, which is probably not workable.<br>
<br>
I don't think anything besides case 3 is realistically usable. skull/IV with no drums is very easy to accomodate, although unnatural.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">The reason, as outlined by others earlier in the thread, is that a 10 minute fight with zero-downtime is a very unrealistic model for any SSC/TK fight. Most fights in SSC or TK have a 10 minute enrage so that is a reasonable upper bound, but none of these fights consist of 100% dps time.</div>

</div>I'd rather spec for the worst case than spec for the best case. The worst case is that we've lost half our DPS and are fighting to kill the boss before it enrages... I want my contribution to that fight to be as high as possible. We're wiping 2/3 of the time for some reason or another. Four weeks ago we killed Void Reaver AFTER the enrage timer (sadly, I was one of the dead). The most important time to still be doing the most damage is when the fight is most critical... if we're downing the boss in 6 minutes, then obviously it's not so critical that I do maximum DPS. If we're catching the boss at 9 minutes and 45 seconds, my total damage over that time is extremely important.<br>

</div>That's an excellent writeup, but it is completely useless for me, because it's comparing the tradeoff of taking AM for a fire spec... that's going to be a really poor trade, obviously. 42 points in Frost however loses no damage, only CC, so there's no damage tradeoff at all making AM a far more palatable choice.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">However, given that many (most?)

</div>That is definitely an issue. The ranged DPS do not get a shaman, a shadowpriest, or JoW. We have one resto shaman normally, who is in with the healers (who get our sole shadowpriest as well). You can discuss the inequity all you like, but it doesn't change the fact that not every mage will get a shadowpriest or a shaman in every raid. In fact, I'm sure many of you have had to do without more than once. You obviously shouldn't spec for something that happens to you occasionally, but our raid is short on regen classes... the few times I've had a spriest it was like a flood of mana filling me with power... sadly, I've rarely had the luck.<br>

Rank 14 Frostbolt spam (accounting for EP/Frost Channeling): -114 mps<br>

Gems (reconjure cost is ~ -4.5mps (1670 per 6min), but during this time you aren't frost bolting, so I will approximate as -4mps: +20mps - 4mps = +16mps<br>

</div>You have to look at the DPS cost of Mana pots, Evocate, and Mage Armor as well, as in the link you provided. The costs aren't as high for me (because my DPS isn't as high as the Sunwell dream gear the linked post considered), but they still exist. By dropping Frost CC/solo/instance talents, that allows me to do normal fights with just Mana Gems. That frees me up to skip Evocate (more DPS), use destro pots (more DPS), or use molten armor rather than mage armor (even more DPS). These are valuable choices not available to a 10/0/51 spec. I can use mage armor, mana pots, and evocate to get through a long Solarian fight with no support... or I can use destro pots, molten armor, and skip evocating to maintain higher DPS on more normal fights.<br>

</div>It never becomes superfluous, because it increases the choices for frost mages while losing them no raid DPS talents (just CC/instance/solo talents). That, and I get the very nice 5 points in improved AE, increasing my AoE damage (which frankly sucks for frost mages).<br>
<br>
Edit: I'm probably going to respec again to make a slight fix... on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080421235252/http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/classes/mage/talents.html?tal=2400052300030000000000000000000000000000000000535002310230010051551" target="_blank">my spec</a> I have 4 points in Arcane Focus... a pointless waste, since I'll be targeting 124 hit rating for Frostbolt. So I moved 1 point out of AF to put into Ice Floes. I *may* also drop Ice Barrier to put another point into Ice Floes, but that I'm less sure of. I don't need it for pushback prevention anymore, but the loss of about 2000 health (start a fight with it on and put it up again during fight) for soloing and instancing is not something I'm sure I can give up, just so Cold Snap can pop 48s sooner.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_716792"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Unless you're trying to carry weights of people that you know are definitely going to die where you will live, saying you want to handle long fights due to dead people can be countered by saying you need to unload your dps before you die yourself. Just like other people might die early and cause you to need an extended DPS period, you also might die making all your extended dps ability moot. That's why I completely ignore "the death issue" when comparing gear/specs, as in reality if I was in a raid where it mattered I wouldn't be a raid because I simply can't stand where everyone keep dying next to me to stuff that are easily survivable. So no matter how you look at it, considering deaths doesn't change the way gear/specs affect your play.<br>
<br>
As for haste and dpm etc, remember at the end stuff like rawr do a good job at evaluating the gains from extra mana efficiency, not just straight DPS. As long as you put realistic conditions and not something rediculess like a 10 minute fight with 100% DPS uptime. If you're going to do 10 minutes (which is reasonable for void reaver learning attempts) be more realistic and put 70-90% DPS uptime - since if the fight takes long it should be because people are running around a lot, not because they're dead and you're doing their job. And to be honest I don't see myself doing anywhere near 100% DPS uptime on void reaver either - it's just too movement intensive.<br>
<br>
Too bad stuff like WWS completely skew DPS uptime. I wish it actually counted your DPS time based on the time it should've taken you to cast your spells rather than the time you spent with damage being dealt within the last 5 seconds which actually allows you to have 50% DPS time with frostbolts but have WWS show 100%, not to mention fireball with the DoT can have as low as 23% DPS uptime while still showing 100% on WWS due to its dot. If you really want to know your DPS uptime count the number of abilities used and apply any relevent haste to it and see how much time you spent casting those abilities VS how long the fight lasted.<br>
<br>
MyrddinE, keep in mind nobody told you to spec back to 10/0/51. 17/0/44 is quite superior for raid DPS, it's just that 2/48/11 is superior to both of those specs.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Dream of working cold snap spec is simply too delicious to dismiss too easily. Though Nurru argued that this topic is already been beaten to death, I believe there is yet another aspect to it that has been overlooked (browsed 2.3 thread from around p90 to end). This aspect is relatively low true value of combustion which leads to a new variant of 0/40/21. <br>
<br>
Proposed variant of 0/40/21 - <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?talent=oZxgz0fMI0gMxihMhRb0o" target="_blank">Talent Calculator - World of Warcraft</a><br>
<br>
Main benefits:<br>
 - 1 additional icy veins<br>
 - 1 additional ice block (aggressive use such as silence at Azgalor while popping cooldowns)<br>
<br>
The losses:<br>
- mana efficiency<br>
- 1% crit<br>
- loss of treath reduction in AE<br>
<br>
The main argument is that combustion's value should be questioned because some of the combustion induced crits will happen regardless of it. I do recall previous posters expressing their doubts on combustion, but I believe this is first attempt to quantify it.<br>
<br>
<b>The math:</b><br>
<br>
I consider quite conservative scenario of cooldown stacking: <br>
- duration 20s<br>
- no heroism, drums (these would make my case stronger)<br>
-&gt; enough haste in order to be able to fit 8 fireball casts into 20s window.<br>
-&gt; with no haste and some lag 7 fireballs should be possible in 20s window.<br>
<br>
What is the probability of combustion being completely irrelevant when stacking cooldowns?<br>

<br>
<b>Value of extra IV:</b><br>
<br>
Roywyn valuated IV as following <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080421235252/http://elitistjerks.com/658230-post3191.html" target="_blank">http://elitistjerks.com/658230-post3191.html</a>:<br>

	<tbody><tr>
		<td class="alt2" style="border:1px inset">
			
				20% haste for 20s every 180s =&gt; 2.2% haste averaged.[...]
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Fundamentally the value of additional IV is inversely related to the duration of encounter. As extension of this line of thought, at 6 minutes 20% haste for 20s averages out to 1,11% haste. In naive comparison, the loss of 1% is not an issue. <br>
<br>
Due to the complexity, I will use more qualitative approach to discuss the potential loss of crit during stacked cooldowns. The offered benefit are situations with 2 non-stacking trinkets and getting more out of a flamecap and possibly molten fury. With 2 trinket scheme, extra IV should allow one additional trinketed fireball vs. lost trinketed crits from combustions(2 rounds). It's worth noting that the 1% crit from pyromaniac should not be forgotten while comparing the benefits.<br>
<br>
As special case where this shines sub-3 minute encounters extra IV allows two rounds of 2 min cooldown stacking against IV. <br>
<br>
As final word, I don't propose this as the new mainstream dps spec but rather as a new perspective to discussion around this particular spec. There is more work to be done before before such statement could be made. Afterall, I do not present mana considerations nor go deeply into valuating the benefits of additional IV. Should my math survive the scrutiny, I hope this bit is a contribution to mage TC community who's insights I have enjoyed for a long time already <!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Personally, I don't really mind whatever spec you go for. However, I can't help but notice that you seem to have the same stance than everyone that asks me questions about specs. The way your post is formulated makes me strongly believe that you do not really seek answers, but rather, expects to get patted in the back somehow. So my question is this. Are you really interested in argumenting about specs, or you really just want to keep your spec no matter what?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>While I agree that in a situation where you are not getting a shadow priest or a shaman (and assuming you ARE actually running out of mana without AM) then yes it will be beneficial.  Also, it's true to an extent that you aren't really giving up strict raiding talents for it either.  However, there IS a point where you can pop destro pots and mana gems, not evocate, and use molten armor with the 10/0/51 build, and when you reach that point (typically when you have a shadow priest and/or a shaman you are there), 10/0/51 is a better build because AM will be worthless because you can do the same things in the 10/0/51 build already so extra mana is giving you no more increased damage.<br>
<br>
One reason would be Ice Floes.  While often times it won't make a difference (ie fights under 6 minutes in length you will only be able to use cold snap once) or possibly too long (over 9 minutes, and assuming 10 minute enrages) you will be able to cold snap twice regardless, there are those fights that will last between ~7-8 minutes, and you will see a DPS increase in those fights by have Ice Floes for the 2nd cold snap and an additional water elemental use.<br>
<br>
With the remaining 9 points, you have several options, including modifying to a 13/0/48 build (to get arcane impact to fix the aoe problem you are complaining about).  You have choices of increased damage from shatter (helps with trash and aoe) and control from imp blizz/permafrost/frostbite.<br>
<br>
At the very least, you should be 13/0/48 as soon as you reach the point where you are not evocating, using molten armor, and popping destro pots and still finishing the fight with mana to spare.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>That is true, I do move around frequently. I specified 100% DPS uptime because Rawr has a bug with idle time... it assumes all idle time is in one huge chunk, which gives very skewed regen amounts. 10% downtime means more like 3-5% of OO5SR regen, since the first 5s of each downtime has no regen. For example, dodging blasts on Void Reaver rarely takes more than 5 seconds, so despite not shooting, I'm also not getting OO5SR regen ticks... but Rawr would count all that dodging with full regen, as if the 5sr was actually the 0sr.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I think that ultimately we cannot easily quantify the worth of coldsnap. It is very dependant upon context. 0/40/21 came back into the light due to Eredar Twins, a fight that is notably far more involved than any other fight before it in terms of healing requirements. Look at any WWS or any killshot of Eredar twins, you will notice 10-13 healers. This is where double ice block really comes in handy. But here comes the tricky part; the worth of cold snap (purely for double ice block, I am ignoring double icy veins) is purely speculative. It <i>might</i> keep you alive longer, but should you really trust your skills and be really really pro at chaffing your potions at the precise time it will save you, then you probably don't need it. Double ice block might also do nothing. Its definately a nice-to-have for that fight, but I do believe the fight is controllable enough that you shouldn't need it if you accept the fact that you will probably be using a major fire protection potion/healthstone during the fight. I know I sure as hell did not respecced for that to ease our first kill.<br>
<br>
However, with all of this said, I am having a very hard time to agree with the build (0/40/21). First, the 2nd icy veins does not have as much synergy because you already used the first one with the 2min cooldowns. Second, the build is totally devoid of aoe tools. You lose blastwave, dragon's breath, -40% threat on arcane explosion (which is now a really good aoe spell, particularly with IV) <i>and</i> possibly even combustion depending on how you spent the points in 0/40/21. Combustion might be relatively a bad talent, but it really shines on aoe. -1% dmg (or -1%crit, again, depending on where you put the points) cannot be ignored either. You also lose a bit on DPM with the particular loss of 1pt master of elements. The DPM losses are fairly minor and unimportant. The core issue i have with the build is really that it is incapable of doing any aoe with any kind of efficiency. And even if that wasn't a major issue, the build is hardly suitable for anything else besides sub-3min fights where your double lust fits in the only lust you get. In almost any other case, the -1% crit loss (pyromaniac) and &gt; ~1% crit loss from lost ignite will put you about on par with 2/48/11 dps. What do you noticeably gain is 100% pushback protection during IV, which can occasionally help, but again, thats kinda like splitting hairs in half.<br>
<br>
I am not debating whether or not the spec can give close numbers to 2/48/11 on single target dps, but I do question heavily its flexibility. <br>
<br>
A good point about combustion average worth depending upon spell haste. But unfortunately, I still strongly believe that trying to value cooldowns as 'averages' for mages is ill. If we could reliably see the <i>absolute</i> worth of a cooldown when stacked with other cooldowns, then I would consider that the average when compared to total damage done.<br>
<br>
also, for an approximate worth of combustion, you might want to be aware of this:<br>
combustion (At 40% crit rate, it gives you 10%, 20%, 30%, 32%, 22%, 9%, 1.4%, 0.1% crit (on average) for casts 1 to 8. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080421235252/http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t16781-mage_help_me_please/p25/#post691365" target="_blank">[Mage] Help me please?</a> )<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>As justification for the 3 crit assumption, it was used to get a upper boundary for combustion's value in order to support my argument that combustion is often irrelevant. The context is specifically cooldown stacking for single target dps. <br>
<br>
My idea was indeed to move away from averages to probabilities and individual events within small time frames. Ironically I ended up presenting another set of average values. The correct valuation is probabilistic in my opinion. For example, as in my previous post: with 40% crit and ability to fit 8 fireballs into 20 second window of cooldown stacking, combustion is meaningless in 68% of cases. In talent discussion, this type of theorycraft information should be viable. Granted, from the spreadsheet and optimization perspective this is probably quite hard to use and average approximations give workable results. <br>
<br>
Hopefully this addition clarified my perspective a bit.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Thank you for the replies! I do agree with the points about aoe capability. In theoretical discussion it's easy to limit the scope and look at certain types of situations - single target dps in this case. <br>
<br>
As justification for the 3 crit assumption, it was used to get a upper boundary for combustion's value in order to support my argument that combustion is often irrelevant. The context is specifically cooldown stacking for single target dps. <br>
<br>
My idea was indeed to move away from averages to probabilities and individual events within small time frames. Ironically I ended up presenting another set of average values. The correct valuation is probabilistic in my opinion. For example, as in my previous post: with 40% crit and ability to fit 8 fireballs into 20 second window of cooldown stacking, combustion is meaningless in 68% of cases. In talent discussion, this type of theorycraft information should be viable. Granted, from the spreadsheet and optimization perspective this is probably quite hard to use and average approximations give workable results. <br>
<br>
Hopefully this addition clarified my perspective a bit.</div>

</div>You have some very big misconceptions. If you crit more than 3 times this does not mean that combustion is meaningless. You will still get more crits because the first 3 crits will happen sooner, or rather while combustion is up you will get more crits than if it wasn't up.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I do appreciate the offer Austin, thank you. As far as the belt... I'll get it sometime, but that's a hell of a lot of effort for 20dps (the difference between a belt of blasting and the badge belt). I'll be able to get the badge belt later this week, and that'll be enough of an upgrade for the near future. And I'm working on the mats for shadoweave, but I'm not gonna bother until I get more T4 pieces... the T4p2 bonus is far too worthwhile to give up.</div>

</div>I think that you're seriously overstating the T4 2 piece bonus, the only place that I would find that useful is on Illhoof, Hex Lord, and Teron Gorefiend, but I don't use them, and I've never used them...and I was frost the time that we were farming Kara and Gruul's Lair.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">But there's still something that concerns me... you're all discussing how to spend thousands of gold (or equivalent farming time) in order to gear past the point where this spec is valuable... long fights (progression) in underpowered gear. Maybe it's been so long that you don't remember what progression is like? This is my first 70... I don't have thousands of gold lying around. I don't have time to farm thousands of gold... except for raid nights, I mostly quest with my mother (who is retired). I have a job, and a wife who doesn't appreciate it if I ignore her. ;-)<br>
<br>
My point is that throwing money (and asking someone to buy multi-thousand-gold worth of purple crafted items is throwing money) at a problem isn't necessarily the best fix. A different spec is a hell of a lot cheaper, and if it nets me good DPS (and I'm always somewhere between 2nd and 4th in my raid), I really don't see the sense in killing myself for incrementally better gear... that's why I'm raiding!</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>I think that I'm talking about less then a week of daily quests worth of gold(the ones that I don't do because I have too much in RL).  I don't see how you're obtaining gear causes your spec to no longer be a viable build, because I see frost as viable, but not the best in terms of ultimate DPS.  I tried out the T5 2 piece bonus with the Lightning Cap, only to have it nerfed into the ground, requiring me to respec and regem all of my gear again, now that's when a spec is no longer viable.<br>
<br>
I started out with the random blue and green for a long time, I made the Spellstrike and retained the Spellstrike 2 piece bonus until I picked up the leggings from Kaz'rogal in Hyjal(3 weeks ago), I used the helm until I replaced it with the helm from the Hex Lord(replaced with T6 2 weeks later, which was last week).  I used the Girdle of Ruination until I replaced it with the Spellfire(when I was able to respec out of Mooncloth), I then replaced it with the Belt of Blasting.  Spellfire chest--&gt;Vestments of the Sea Witch(still use), Spellfire gloves--&gt;Studious Wraps(picked up T6 a week later).<br>
<br>
The crafted items were the best available for me, and it's what I made and used for a long, long time, that's not throwing any gold away.  The 2 easiest things to fix for you are your current spec, and obtaining the crafted/badge gear.  For the most part all of the gear available are incremental upgrades, gone are the upgrading from T0/1--&gt;T2 where it was a huge jump.<br>
<br>
I have always been either top, or within the top 5 in terms of DPS, I'm a DPS class and it's what I need to do.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">My claim is that at 600 int, 300 spi, and about +1200 damage raid buffed, 18/0/42+1 is a better progression spec (long fights where everyone is in similar level gear) for TK and SSC than any of the other specs listed. Talk about that. Show me why I'm wrong, or where Rawr is wrong. Show me with numbers... I've already shown my numbers. But don't just tell me I'm wrong without offering some minimal TC to back it up. And don't tell me my gear is shit... I know it. The discussion isn't about the gear, it's about a spec that may be better for people in lower gear. Everyone has to pass through it at some point, and not everyone has a guild that can coddle a shitty player, carrying their sorry asses through Kara Grrul and Mags a dozen times till they have better gear... I'm trying to ask if anyone cane show (with numbers) why this spec is inferior at this gear level. Not for people to tell me how I can get better gear... I posted this in a TC thread, not in Help Me Please.</div>

</div>For the computations based upon a 10 minute fight, which I don't see as being a valid argument since there are so very few 10 minute fights, i.e. Vashj(I think), Al'ar, and Kael'thas(a lot of downtime though), not sure what else I missed.<br>
<br>
When you start looking at more realistic kill times on the bosses, your theory crafting of the spec no longer holds water.   I have a very mana inefficient build, I drink mana potions all the way until the boss is dead, I use mana gems until &lt;20% where I use Flame Caps, I use Evocation if I need a refill and I'm in between pots, and gems.<br>
<br>
You should do the theory crafting based upon fight times at 5 minutes, 7 minutes, and 9 minutes, the vast majority of the fights will last between 5 and 7 minutes, with the longer fights lasting 9 minutes.<br>
<br>
Don't plan gear, gems and enchants based upon 1 scenario, look at them all and see what works best for all of them, and what works best 80-90% of the time.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Not to mention that as I said earlier the WE is practically "free" damage in terms of mana. If you could only spend a couple hundred mana every 3 minutes frost would actually be many times more powerful than any spec. Setting a fight in a way that runs you oom badly (and exactly 10 mins for 2nd cold snap) brings you just a tad closer to this scenario where frost is useful, but that doesn't happen in reality. In reality fire wins even on a 10-minute void reaver, vashj and kael (well kael you could argue arcane since phase 2 is the only phase that really matters too much where 175% crit AE can do good).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Arcane Explosion scales with haste too. It can crit, works with TLC/AToI, and even without crits it does twice the DPS of Blizzard due to AoE caps (3.6k/tick for Blizzard, 10k/cast for AE).<br>
<br>
Blizzard is a cheap ranged AoE snare. I think it is very versatile and a great tool that no other class has.<br>
It does however not provide good AoE DPS.<br>
<br>
<br>
Oh, another random fact of the day.<br>
4T6 is most likely not a 5% DPS increase, it seems to be additive with Fire Power (+10% damage), not multiplicative.<br>
At least the spell book entry works that way. Fireball is base is 649-821, 746-945 with Fire Power + T6, which is a 1.15 multiplier, and not 1.1*1.05. (Playing with Fire is not reflected in the spellbook at all).<br>
<br>
So, 4T6 is only a 4.54545% damage increase for Fireball. Not the first bug, not the last ...<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Play with the numbers a bit more before jumping to conclusions.<br>
<br>
Running my stats through (but changing shoulders and gloves to T6 for the other 2 specs) I get <br>
<br>
40/0/21 - 5627.05 dps on 8 targets with AE <br>
2/48/11 - 4495.22 dps on 8 targets with AE<br>
0/0/49+ - 4364.29 dps on 8 targets with AE<br>
<br>
0/0/49+ - 4552.62 dps on 8 targets with Blizzard with Icy Veins active.<br>
<br>
Which seems to me to imply that Blizzard would be competitive with Arcane Explosion for a Deep Frost or Deep Fire with Icy Veins.  As for the AToI you can always use Flamestrike to prime it and then Blizzard to take maximum advantage of the haste proc.<br>
<br>
After 8 targets the increased cap does push things in AEs favor but the snare does help out Blizzard's cause as well on packs that are that large.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Oh, another random fact of the day.<br>
4T6 is most likely not a 5% DPS increase, it seems to be additive with Fire Power (+10% damage), not multiplicative.<br>
At least the spell book entry works that way. Fireball is base is 649-821, 746-945 with Fire Power + T6, which is a 1.15 multiplier, and not 1.1*1.05. (Playing with Fire is not reflected in the spellbook at all).<br>
<br>
So, 4T6 is only a 4.54545% damage increase for Fireball. Not the first bug, not the last ...</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>How did you get the numbers with 4T6, afaik the last time I used Blizzard default UI it didn't use stuff like set bonuses. That would mean the calculation is being done by a mod which may or may not be correct. It's true though, % based increases to your own damage, from talents, stack additively (SM + Demon Sacrifice f/e for warlocks). No idea at this time about set bonuses but ... might be the same since it's a self % increase.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>A lot of gear bonuses are actually shown. Range increases (PvP gloves), cooldown reductions, Arcane Blast mana/damage (2T5). Buffs are usually only shown if they change cast time/mana cost.<br>
I'd guess that for warlocks, Emberstorm and 4T6 damage change the damage displayed but Demonic Sacrifiec does not.<br>
<br>
For mages, the Spellbook adds 5% for 4T6, 10% for Fire Power (talent), 15% for both. Playing with Fire (3% to all spells) is not displayed, and I don't remember Arcane Instability.<br>
It may also be that it's calculated in yet another way and the spellbook display is totally wrong (and not just incomplete and mostly meaningless).<br>
The 10-million-damage eploit would be handy to actually test this, damn.<br>
<br>
<br>
Rounce, your numbers seem okay (I'd get slightly more for AE), but why do you compare Blizz+IV to AE without IV? It doesn't really make sense as every about every mage spec has IV.<br>
In your example with 8 mobs, Blizzard is at the AoE cap, while AE is at ~50% of the cap. And Flamstrike-Blizzard rotations with AToI, I'd love to see the numbers how that works out really.<br>
<br>
You've shown that Blizzard during IV is a bit better than AE outside of IV when dealing with 8 targets.<br>
That still makes AE the better AoE DPS spell during IV, outside IV, and especially when going against more targets.<br>
The utility of a slowing ranged AoE is great though.<br>
<br>
<br>
Updated the mana compendium!<br>

<br>
Going OOM is pretty bad. Scorching to avoid OOMing is even worse.<br>
Fire Blast would be quite decent if it didn't cost 3-5 talent points and Ignite wouldn't bug and there was no latency or delay and you'd always be in range.<br>
It's still nigh-worthless for exactly those reasons.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
(I seem to recall manly asking about a WWS of an arcane mage doing over 1600 dps on gorefiend, although that might have been before 2.4, and I did get a power infusion).<br>
Gear is the same as on armory, except <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34917" target="_blank">[Shroud of the Lore`nial]</a> in the chest slot.<br>
<br>
Looking at the buffs and debuffs, I had 8 magic absorption tics.  Looking at the damage recieved, I fully resisted only 2 doom blossom shadow bolts, and no full resists on the immolate.  Partial resists don't add up either, 7 on shadow bolts and 2 on immolate.  I had a look through the log on WWS and it has magic absorption a few times with no reason for it.  Looking at the log file the WWS was generated from yielded the same results.<br>
<br>
Is this a log file problem, not recording something I resisted, or am I missing something?  I had a look at my hyjal logs from and there where was only one case where the number of procs(5) didn't line up with the full resists(4), for kaz'rogal, but I think thats a wws problem, as there where people who had 5 marks, and I had none.<br>
<br>
I remember back when we still killed Tidewalker I would get resist messages from watery tomb even if I was out of range, I never had magic absorption for that, but perhaps it would have proc'd off of that.  Could it be the case that some mechanic of the gorefiend fight that players cannot see is proc'ing magic absorption?  Or does it somehow work differently?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">To state it again (as has been done a ton of times in previous threads), 40/0/21 is perfectly viable for Sunwell provided you have 2pc T5. Depending on group comp and debuffs it's at least competitive if not better than deep fire. But once you have access to Sunwell gear in every slot (say, Twins+), the sheer stats difference from Sunwell gear versus T5 pretty much puts 2/47/11+1 back on top. But presently as we're only just starting to have access to those levels of gear, it's disingenuous to call either spec "better" - it depends heavily on you, your guild, and your playstyle.</div>

</div>I have to say this comment is almost right on. <br>
<br>
I used the 18/0/43 spec for the Illidan fight (and still do for it's benefits <i>besides</i> it's DPS).  What I noticed in application of the spec was this: With an elemental shaman and a shadow priest in your group the mana efficiency is almost excessive while wearing mage armor.  I selected the spec at first because I predicted this excessive mana generation. <br>
<br>
I used the arcane meditation + mage armor to its full advantage for the fight to allow use of my healthstones, and destruction potions.  During heavy raid DPS phases I was able to even use <b>mana shield</b> in combinations with fire ward and ice barrier to avoid most raid-wide damage during the duration of the fight, not to mention being able to HS up just in case it really got heavy.<br>
<br>
Sample Illidan Kill: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080421234918/http://wowwebstats.com/21ud3gpveut6c?s=7729-8624" target="_blank">Wow Web Stats</a>.  No those are not pretty meters by any standards and certainly not my own.<br>
<br>
The overall DPS produced for the fight was far from impressive in regards to what I have generated in other specs (47/11/3, 40/0/21, 6/44/11).  If your goal is to min/max for DPS this spec is not for that.  The applications of it are truly few and far between, being that I would find it preferential in perhaps, one fight so far in all the MH/BT content.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>If you want an arcane mage DPS report for Gorefiend, without PI, post 2.4 here's one from the 10th of April, so long as the only criterion is that it surpasses 1600 dps (despite the pushbacks on that fight): <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080421234918/http://wowwebstats.com/nokxqfad4xhva?s=11538-11743" target="_blank">Wow Web Stats</a>  <br>

Acoro and I were using the arcane spec that I started using since summer of 2007 (47/11/3) up until last week when we started trying 40/0/21 for kicks..  I'm not present in this WWS because I usually sit for Teron Gorefiend and the only one I have with me in was from the 17th of April where I was 40/0/21 but I was also the first ghost so the report is unreliable.<br>
<br>
It's quite easy to pass 1600 dps on any fight in arcane even though I have yet to grab a piece of T6 to boost that damage.  Plus, there's always fights like RoS that are especially fun in arcane due to the threat reduction =).  WWS from this week's shows 5095 dps on Essence of Anger which is always a blast!<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I'm curious. Do these fantom-resists only occur on Twins and possible Zul'jin or is it encountered elsewhere in other content? I recall T5 as not producing any amount of mana that I did not expect but have not specced it since entering T6.<br>

		<div id="post_message_718715"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->It's always had that Pintofbrew, to prevent any sort of strange AE madness or something similar. <br>
<br>
AS for the cause of the phantom resists, it's clearly linked to some mechanic going on behind the fight that we don't see - perhaps a mob targetting system? (As we know that targetting both Zul'Jin and the Twins fights). Mobs that use alternative targetting systems often "cast" something to determine the target (such as RoS fixate in phase 1). Possibly that's going on here, but it's being hidden from the players.<br>
<br>
And just to fourth or whatever the Teron Gorefiend parses - we had mages at 2300 before they picke dup their Skulls of Gul'dan, without flasks or destruction pots. 1600 to 1800 really isn't very good nowadays - proper cooldown stacking shoudl push you much higher.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_718789"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Yea the rational behind the CD makes sense of course, but I was under the impression it was recently implemented, perhaps I just wasn't observant enough when I was playing around with my talents.<br>
<br>
My main wonder is however, how many fights have these mysterious undocumented targettings and how many one can resist. Given arcane mages always raid with Mage Armor, GotW and (for the sake of this experiment) at least 3/5 magic abs, how many bosses can one generate mana from, at what frequency, and does the fight lend it's self to more mana flow? For example, a high-mobility fight costs an arcane mage many AB debuff drop-offs, meaning mana-dumping may not be a veritable option. Typical of this is Illidan past P2: High mobility and phase-changing means merry Christmas trying to dump mana with AB. This means that even if this boss has some invisible resists it wouldn't do much at all for us. If however, Brutallus seemed to do the same, different story.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_719014"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I've just been looking through WWS for my previous raid group at 1 particular mage who I know has Magic Absorption (4/5 points) and found some really odd results.  Not sure if it's just WWS not displaying resists properly or not though.<br>
<br>
So far I've seen the following:<br>
TIC, Illidan, Rage, Anetheron, Kaz'rogal: 6 resists, 6 procs<br>
Teron, RoS, Shahraz: 5 resists, 18 procs<br>
Kaz'rogal, Archimonde: 12 resists, 7 procs (not sure what was going on here - 4 resists were for normal damage so they might not be counted but no idea about the other missed procs)<br>
Shahraz, TIC, Illidan, Rage: 6 resists, 7 procs<br>
Naj'entus, Supremus, Akama, RoS, Teron, Gurtogg: 10 resists, 14 procs<br>
<br>
(I don't have the actual combat logs for these and don't want to link the parses as I'm not part of the raid group now.  I've mainly posted these as more confirmation of something wierd going on and more data points to compare if this is actually related to specific bosses/abilities).<br>
<br>
EDIT: LostnFound:  That parse has 10 resists and 8 procs.  2 of the resists are for normal damage so I assume they're not counted as magic damage.  So basically I think your parse is actually as expected.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Here's one from last night. 2 full Resists and 11 MagAbs procs over the night. (I'm 4/5 Mag Abs)<br>
<br>
Another Mage (Dreadmor) experienced something similar, having 3 resists and 6 procs. (He's 5/5 Mag Abs)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_719613"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Now I may be out in left field here, but here goes anyway.  Maybe the resists that are triggering magic absorption aren't dmg/boss effect based.  It seems like the procs are happening in healing intensive fights, and may be linked to the dispel bug.<br>
<br>
I'm sure most are familiar with the dispel bug, but if not, there's a chance when dispelled/cleansed/decursed/etc to resist the "dispel" when you shouldn't be able to resist it.  Maybe it could a trinket proc, or being at full health and a chain heal "resisting" when it tries to jump to you.  Who knows?<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Does IV still stack with Bloodlust?  The reason I ask is because a Mage in my guild thought it no longer did (due to the patch note wording).  If it does, is the best time to use this in conjunction with Bloodlust and a trinket activation during the 20% phase of say Brutallus for the most damage over time, or is keeping up <i>some</i> kind of buff spread across the duration of the fight instead of cooldown stacking going to be better or worse?   As a Warrior I can only assume that stacking all of the cooldowns (first IV with destruction pots and drums) that you can, especially at 20% is going to make a bigger impact overall.</div>

	</tbody></table>
</div><br>
Yes, IV stacks with Bloodlust, and stacking cooldowns will produce the best mage DPS. The reason is simple: By stacking haste cooldowns with others (particularly short-duration cooldowns such as trinkets and destruction potions), you'll be able to fit more spells into the time window in which those damage-enhancing cooldowns are active. If you could cast, say, 6 fireballs over 15 seconds by stacking IV+trinket+destruction potion, and 7-8 by stacking BL+IV+trinket+destruction potion, the latter would be the clear winner, since you'd be able to cast additional fireballs while under the effects of the trinket and destruction potion. That's just a rough example, but it demonstrates the logic of cooldown-stacking.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Maybe not.  Ignoring the added mana regen from +18 intellect and spirit from the flask, and looking only at mana gained from 4/5 Magic Absorption, a full resist from a mage with a 13k mana pool would yield 520 mana.  It takes 104 seconds at 25 mp5 to equate to that much mana.  Getting an extra resist from +35 resistance every 104 seconds in some boss fights hardly seems like a stretch.<br>
<br>
Now if you consider that the stats from the flask as well, it really starts to shine.  For me, raid buffed with Mage Armor, an extra 18 intellect and 18 spirit is equal to another 20 mp5 in the 5 sec. rule according to Rawr.  Factor in all the other obvious benefits to extra stats, and it seems like an excellent flask for an arcane mage to use on some encounters, especially when learning them.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_719890"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->365 resist is 75% resist on binary spells.<br>
<br>
On non-binary spells it's average 75% damage reduction, which is actually not a huge chance of a full resist. It's also not linear and I remember a very long time ago there was a discussion of attempts to figure out the formula that is used for the distribution of different resist chances (100%, 75%, 50%, 25%, 0%) based on your resistance value but no results that matched reality were found (at least back then when I checked the thread). Anyway blizzard has a table with the distribution for 50, 100, 150 and 200 resistance value for level 50 (which should be the same as 91.25, 182.5, 273.75 and 365 for 73) - this can be found doing a quick search on worldofwarcraft.com which I would rather avoid loading at the moment due to how slow it loads for me for some odd reason...<br>
<br>
If you'll look at how generally non-binary spell resistances work, you'll see that resistance will increase your chance to get a full resist by very, very little. However with max resistance your chance to actually take full damage is only 1%, so 99% to partially resist *something* (and on average resist 75% of the damage).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I don't mean to nitpick or anything, but those examples do not go back far enough in time to so us a good enough sample. Up to 2second delay is possible on talent procs.<br>
<br>
Although Magic Absorption is an absurdly over powered talent when using full resist gear it is now in TBC a wasted talent on almost every fight in the game. The reason in pre-TBC WoW it was so good it was part of the best dps spec for a long long time. Now it's a filler talent, and there are 1 or 2 fights max which benefit as a whole from the talent.<br>
<br>
It may be bugged to return mana when it shouldn't, and not returning mana when it should, but it does <i>not</i> provide a big enough difference in an Arcane Blast spec to make a noticeable different in your end dps, 1-2 spells different max.<br>

You seem to be forgetting one very important point: yes, it’s a filler talent but in a part of the arcane tree that is mostly comprised of fillers anyway.

		<div id="post_message_720326"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'll pass on HP regen. it's utterly foreign to mage mechanics and I don't see why it should be introduced. Many have questioned why mages are the masters of magic yet can only remove curses and have about fuck all tools to deal with magic incoming. I feel an arcane-spec based increased magic resistance would be perfect and fit the role: Arcane mage, highly resilient to magic, chews mana like candy, has monster int/manapool... Suits the role. This is however, largely irrelevant to the thread even though it's vaguely related to making more mana for the arcane blast to chew up.<br>
<br>
As for the resistance flask, a good thought but sadly lacking. Even the 18 all stats doesn't help as it's for the most part rather pathetic compared to Draenic Wisdom and Adept's. Granted, a flask is not the same as elixirs, but when Draenic/Adepts is so damn cheap I honestly prefer to elixir rather than flask unless I'm in for an utter complete and total wipefest, ie over 8 wipes per flask. One can farm a stack of draenic with a herbie in terrocar in 20-30m for pete's sake. Adept's isn't far off. A stack of Major Fire Power and a stack of Mageblood costs about the same as renting a personal gnome-slave for a month. And an epic one at that.<br>
<br>
Arcane's reliance on much easier to obtain consumables than fire while not a valid TC argument for it is a very pleasant side-effect.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_720374"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Considering the fact that the mage class has seen significant conclusive changes with 2.3/2.4 (The increase of the AoE cap, 1-2 IB) I'm puzzled why not more mages are discussing the ”new mage identity”. After 2.4 we are now the uncontested king of AoE/CC with alot more survivability (Seeing that the majority of trash in SW are humanoids). What price did we have to pay you ask?<br>
<br>
Blizzard have basically decided that they want mages to be king of CC/AoE while they want destro locks to be king of single target DPS (With a relatively large margin).<br>
<br>
I made a thread about this earlier: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080501142142/http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=3545655417&amp;sid=1" target="_blank">WoW-Europe.com Forums -&gt; Destro locks do 9,5% more DPS than Fire mages</a><br>
<br>
Basically there have been discussions going on since the patch regarding how to increase our dmg in the range 0,1-1% through impressive, untraditional and very creative means (Rolling ignites etc, spell combos etc.). Thats great, but trying to bypass the mage development through TC might even be counter productive to reaching our goals (Just look at the CD stacking nerf, hitting mages the hardest). Its not a secret that Blizz devs are using the info here for ”balancing purposes”. Its pretty remarkable that not more ppl are outraged that Blizzard have literally continued with and implemented more mechanics that are now resulting in destro locks on average outdpsing mages by 9,5%+ (Brutallus average).<br>
<br>
In reality the devs have put a wig + some lipstick on us, and placed us in a corner the majority of mages don't want to be. While CC and AoE are important, Blizzard thinks its alot more important than we would personally hope for (Resulting in their conclusion that they want destro locks to do +10% more dmg on single target). They have even designed mage viability in SW around concepts we see as secondary (Excellent CC, AoE, Decursing, IB). At the same time they have allowed the destro lock to become the uncontested king of single target magical dmg (With a rather large margin).<br>
<br>
I see Blizzards new policy of creating a greater distinction like this quite logical tbh, creating niches among the classes if you will. But personally Im quite disappointed that the destro lock/mage ”war” is near the end without the ppl that could have helped change it all not even lifting an eyebrows throughout this transition.<br>
<br>
I would welcome more progressive/proactive discussion regarding the mage class/identity in 2.4 as a whole. We have gradually gotten run over with a bulldozer and ppl havent even noticed I encourage mages here (The most influential mages without a doubt considering that Blizz are using these boards as reference to balancing issues) to be more progressive/proactive regarding where we want to see the mage class before it is too late. Dont be so afraid to make demands (Noone is going to yell l2p at you).<br>
<br>
Personally I would like to see the arcane tree as a utility tree (Empowering our CC, AoE, survivability), while letting fire/frost become our pure DPS trees that allow for reduced AoE, CC, survivability but also lets us do equal DPS as destro locks. However, this will never happen unless ppl stop being idle and start demanding. In the worst case scenario, the current development will continue and we will end up with even more powerful CC/AoE/survivability with only 80% single target dps.<br>

edited to avoid making a completely useless post.<br>
<br>
As for the usefulness of mages I wonder how much of it is due to Blizzard seeing what some mages can accomplish with a perfectly stacked group and then not realizing that other classes (warlocks in particular) can do so much more with the same stacking.<br>
<br>
It's like Blizzard has this nice image in their mind of how every class will function in every situation and then people come along and figure out how to make a certain class do 1000x better and then they are scrambling to get it back under control.<br>
<br>
The 6% bonus on warlock T6 is like that.  They got 6% because Blizzard figured on them still using DoTs and other spells alongside the main nukes so the bonus is bigger to attempt to equalize it with the 5% on mage T6 where they are basically just spamming a single spell.  Guess they didn't realize that the locks could spam that single spell just as well as the mages and do even more dps in the process.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

	</tbody></table>
</div>First, let me begin by saying I did not check the referenced link. However, despise this, I am somewhat confident that the data presented is skewed because such is the nature of anything that attempts to make an average out of mage wws results.<br>
<br>
For starters, there is only one real dps spec for warlocks, namely destro (either fire or shadow, both of which have the same amount of points in both trees). This means a consistency of results. Mages, on the contrary, spec many different spec, none of which will be perfectly suited for all fights (ie: one spec might be best for boss x but fail to boss y). This already should be enough to skew the results in such a way that you need to drill down further for proper comparison.<br>
<br>
After that, you have to keep in mind that mage playstyle, while simple in essence, is quite hard to master. I believe this is quite easily shown in wws. You will notice a rather large discrepancy across mage dps, be it across guilds, or inter-guild. I don't think anyone can argue that a shadow destro lock is hard to play from the perspective of 'you only have trinkets/bloodlust/drums/destro pot as cooldowns'. But whatever way you do your cooldowns you don't need to pay as much attention to how you stack them because even a non-stacking scenario will give nearly the same result as a stacked one (because said cooldowns don't impact enough the results).<br>
<br>
And last but not least, mage dps depends upon warlocks. We can't compete without COS or COE (or both). Some mages in those parses probably don't get COE. This will also drag down the numbers.<br>
<br>
So here is what I am saying. The spread of mage specs will lead to an inconsistency of results (or if you prefer, drag our average down). Also, having a more challenging playstyle can only lead to worse numbers and a wider discrepancy of results across mages. I don't really expect any mage to have a perfect play with any kind of regularity, if even to get there once.<br>
<br>
While this is tangential, I believe this is not where the problem lies. There is a great disconnect between Blizzard and its raiding customer base. Itemisation is just one of those examples. Also, the fact that the point of professions is to have an edge with a best-in-slot, but then, what's the point if the patterns doesn't drop? Also, I know Gurgthock was telling us an anecdote yesterday in gchat that during blizzcon he had some developers ask him if we still ran SSC and TK. Gurgthock replied 'no, but we still run Gruul', to which the developers did not understand (sadly, I might add). Now all of this leads me to the next point. Class balancing. I think class balancing is ultimately done for PVP purpose, and whichever way it affects PVE will not cull out a class from being used (...). Not that I believe this is the proper way to do things, but I believe that is the undergoing mentality done for it. If IV is OP in PVP, and they decide to remove it, I am pretty sure they will not look - at all - at the impact of doing so in PVE, because in the grand scheme of things mages will still be able to do the baseline expected dps for all bosses on which the bosses are tweaked upon. Remember for a long time fireball and frostbolt had the 10% coefficient tax, and IV did not exist. I am pretty sure they could put us back in time to that same sorry state - and hey, it would all make sense in the greater scheme of things - I mean, mages will be able to reach the baseline 10.5million / 6min / 15.5 dps class =~ 1882 dps, so hey, they could redo the 10% coefficient nerf and remove IV.<br>
<br>
So yeah, if Blizzard would do something significant to reach across its PVE user base, then maybe something will happen. I know blizzcast is not that. Not even close, particularly given that they can't even tell exclusives in those because gamer's guide and whatnot pay a premium to get to tell the exclusives themselves to increase their sales. What we need is quite simply open discussion on that regard; having employees directly dedicated to the cause.<br>
<br>
In any case, putting all that aside, as I pointed out a long time ago mages suffer most from lack of raid synergy. Is it normal that warlocks increase the dps of the entirety of the raid dps (and if they have 4+ they get to use COD which is like a personal 8-9% dps increase), yet pay no drawback in terms of their personal dps ? I understand that warlocks are not hybrids like shamans or shadow priests are. But they do give a very significant raid dps boost just like hybrids. Maybe the underlying goal was to make hybrids have less personal dps, and to counter-balance this they would increase the dps of others. But then, warlocks are not hybrids, and that somehow avoided them that tax. I am not saying it makes sense, but it does feel very <i>very</i> inconsistent with how hybrids work. Somewhat funny to say given that I remember the long winded argument Blizzard gave us a while ago about how they wanted as much 'consistency' as possible and that was why they put CS on the GCD (I think that was the nerf that came with it, I don't recall exactly). But nevertheless, maybe just maybe if mages had just as much dps raid synergies as warlocks do we could equally compete on DMs? Maybe we will even dodge the hybrid tax just like warlocks.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Spamming AE on waves in Hyjal is rugged on pretty much any spec, although it will definitely provide the most damage.  Unless your guild is really struggling on damage output for these mobs, you don't need to go balls-to-the-wall on the packs.  Just do whatever it takes to get the waves down without running you completely OOM in the process.  I like to open with Blizzard, then AE spam to about 25% mana, then go back to Blizzard.  When I run fire spec I open with a flamestrike, then run in and blastwave and dragon's breath, then AE spam to ya ya, then at around 20% mana if the mobs aren't dead yet I just sit back and flamestrike spam.  The returns I get from that + MoE often let me go back in and AE spam some more if it's needed.

				<div style="font-style:italic">First, let me begin by saying I did not check the referenced link. However, despise this, I am somewhat confident that the data presented is skewed because such is the nature of anything that attempts to make an average out of mage wws results.<br>
<br>
For starters, there is only one real dps spec for warlocks, namely destro (either fire or shadow, both of which have the same amount of points in both trees). This means a consistency of results. Mages, on the contrary, spec many different spec, none of which will be perfectly suited for all fights (ie: one spec might be best for boss x but fail to boss y). This already should be enough to skew the results in such a way that you need to drill down further for proper comparison.<br>
<br>
After that, you have to keep in mind that mage playstyle, while simple in essence, is quite hard to master. I believe this is quite easily shown in wws. You will notice a rather large discrepancy across mage dps, be it across guilds, or inter-guild. I don't think anyone can argue that a shadow destro lock is hard to play from the perspective of 'you only have trinkets/bloodlust/drums/destro pot as cooldowns'. But whatever way you do your cooldowns you don't need to pay as much attention to how you stack them because even a non-stacking scenario will give nearly the same result as a stacked one (because said cooldowns don't impact enough the results).<br>
<br>
And last but not least, mage dps depends upon warlocks. We can't compete without COS or COE (or both). Some mages in those parses probably don't get COE. This will also drag down the numbers.<br>
<br>
So here is what I am saying. The spread of mage specs will lead to an inconsistency of results (or if you prefer, drag our average down). Also, having a more challenging playstyle can only lead to worse numbers and a wider discrepancy of results across mages. I don't really expect any mage to have a perfect play with any kind of regularity, if even to get there once.<br>
<br>
While this is tangential, I believe this is not where the problem lies. There is a great disconnect between Blizzard and its raiding customer base. Itemisation is just one of those examples. Also, the fact that the point of professions is to have an edge with a best-in-slot, but then, what's the point if the patterns doesn't drop? Also, I know Gurgthock was telling us an anecdote yesterday in gchat that during blizzcon he had some developers ask him if we still ran SSC and TK. Gurgthock replied 'no, but we still run Gruul', to which the developers did not understand (sadly, I might add). Now all of this leads me to the next point. Class balancing. I think class balancing is ultimately done for PVP purpose, and whichever way it affects PVE will not cull out a class from being used (...). Not that I believe this is the proper way to do things, but I believe that is the undergoing mentality done for it. If IV is OP in PVP, and they decide to remove it, I am pretty sure they will not look - at all - at the impact of doing so in PVE, because in the grand scheme of things mages will still be able to do the baseline expected dps for all bosses on which the bosses are tweaked upon. Remember for a long time fireball and frostbolt had the 10% coefficient tax, and IV did not exist. I am pretty sure they could put us back in time to that same sorry state - and hey, it would all make sense in the greater scheme of things - I mean, mages will be able to reach the baseline 10.5million / 6min / 15.5 dps class =~ 1882 dps, so hey, they could redo the 10% coefficient nerf and remove IV.<br>
<br>
So yeah, if Blizzard would do something significant to reach across its PVE user base, then maybe something will happen. I know blizzcast is not that. Not even close, particularly given that they can't even tell exclusives in those because gamer's guide and whatnot pay a premium to get to tell the exclusives themselves to increase their sales. What we need is quite simply open discussion on that regard; having employees directly dedicated to the cause.<br>
<br>
In any case, putting all that aside, as I pointed out a long time ago mages suffer most from lack of raid synergy. Is it normal that warlocks increase the dps of the entirety of the raid dps (and if they have 4+ they get to use COD which is like a personal 8-9% dps increase), yet pay no drawback in terms of their personal dps ? I understand that warlocks are not hybrids like shamans or shadow priests are. But they do give a very significant raid dps boost just like hybrids. Maybe the underlying goal was to make hybrids have less personal dps, and to counter-balance this they would increase the dps of others. But then, warlocks are not hybrids, and that somehow avoided them that tax. I am not saying it makes sense, but it does feel very <i>very</i> inconsistent with how hybrids work. Somewhat funny to say given that I remember the long winded argument Blizzard gave us a while ago about how they wanted as much 'consistency' as possible and that was why they put CS on the GCD (I think that was the nerf that came with it, I don't recall exactly). But nevertheless, maybe just maybe if mages had just as much dps raid synergies as warlocks do we could equally compete on DMs? Maybe we will even dodge the hybrid tax just like warlocks.</div>

Interesting read.  A couple of side points I'd like to add and maybe get a response on:<br>
<br>
1)  Raid Synergy and Group composition:  As you said, mages suffer the most from lack of correct group composition and raid synergy, yet if we were to balance mages around NOT having a Shadowpriest / Shaman / Curse of Elements, would we then be "Overpowered" or would we be "Balanced?"  Do you think that if our Ignite added some sort of Increased overall Raid Crit% or some other sort of synergy that Blizzard would then Nerf our DPS and apply what would fall right into the double standard that they currently have set with Warlocks and ISB?  I ask this because, like the original poster you responded to, I'm interested in figuring out what the "solution" is.<br>
<br>
2)  Sample sizes, difficulty of play, management of cooldowns:  Do you think that other classes suffer as much from these aspects as mages?  Have you ever had a Parse where your Crit % was 5-6% lower than your Characters actual base Crit %?  Does this happen with other classes like Warlocks, Druids, or Melee classes?  Is there a way that we, as mages, can avoid having small sample parse sizes where our numbers do not match up with what our actual stats are?  From a difficulty of play aspect, do you think that this should serve as a 'reason' for the wide range of DPS values amoung mages?  Do other classes suffer from the same issues where 'lack of knowledge' or 'difficulty of play' will result in such a wide spread of DPS values across characters of equal gear?  Do you think that sometimes the sample size also will have an effect on this overall DPS value?  How much do you think Management of Cooldowns should affect one classes overall 'generalized' DPS?  Should there be a 5-600 DPS difference between one person who manages them correctly and one who does not?  Is this an issue that is shared with other classes in a Raid (cooldown stacking) or is this a mage specific item because of IV / Combustion / Molten Fury?<br>
<br>

Spamming AE on waves in Hyjal is rugged on pretty much any spec, although it will definitely provide the most damage.  Unless your guild is really struggling on damage output for these mobs, you don't need to go balls-to-the-wall on the packs.  Just do whatever it takes to get the waves down without running you completely OOM in the process.  I like to open with Blizzard, then AE spam to about 25% mana, then go back to Blizzard.  When I run fire spec I open with a flamestrike, then run in and blastwave and dragon's breath, then AE spam to ya ya, then at around 20% mana if the mobs aren't dead yet I just sit back and flamestrike spam.  The returns I get from that + MoE often let me go back in and AE spam some more if it's needed.  Ideally I like to end each wave with just enough mana that if there's an emergency for some reason and I can't drink between a wave, I'll have enough to at least keep a necromancer on sheep.</div>

</div>This is easily the worst way to do aoe. Here are some funfacts<br>
<br>
1- don't flamestrike if your previous flamestrike dot is still up.<br>
2- don't flamestrike if the mobs will die before the flamestrike dot has run its full course (ie: particularly bad to do when youre low on mana since it implies mobs are equally low on hp).<br>
3- don't flamestrike if mobs are not within the area of flamestrike, or might move out of it.<br>
4- don't flamestrike if you have any chance of reaching the flamestrike aoe cap.<br>
5- generally flamestriking is a bad idea. The only case I ever flamestrike is when I get to do combustion-&gt;flamestrike-&gt;blastwave. In other words, combustion is good for aoe, flamestrike is quite questionable.<br>
6- arcane explosion is <i>always</i> the best aoe for 10+ targets, with the only exception of combusted blastwave, because crits can bypass the AOE cap, and combusted blastwave is pretty much 100% crit. With this said, I don't recall exactly the crit aoe cap, but if I recall correctly you can bypass said cap with crits, although I decidedly remember my blastwave crits being somehow limited by some cap.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>There are many possible solution to the lack of raid synergies. I don't think tackling stuff after ignite is the proper fix. The proper fix is to have all classes having abilities that boost other raid member's dps be counter-balanced by a lowered personal dps, just like hybrids seem to be hinting us. You can't penalise COS shadow increase (since that's arguably mostly a personal DPS boost in the first place), but the fact that COS affects also arcane spells, which warlocks don't cast, is quite indicative that they do offer raid synergies with no penalties whereas arguably they should, again, as hinted per shamans/priests/druids/pally dps. What you want is remove stupid abilities that depend upon the number of warlocks available in a raid, like COD. Either remove it, or make it commonplace. Personally, here is what I would recommend, which I am sure both mages and warlocks would love to see.<br>
<br>
1- Remove COS and COE. Entirely. Gone.<br>
2- Change COD significantly. COD increases all magical dmg received by the debuffed target by 10%. Remove the 1-min cooldown. Make it still hit for a large chunk, but arguably (and probably) should lower the dmg done. This would help a lot the really aching affliction locks because they could cast amplify curse/COD instead of just 13% COS like they do right now. Make malediction affect COD (both tick and 10%-&gt;13%). Ideally make it scale for a buttload more for affliction warlocks, possibly even considering 300% efficiency on amplify curse when done on curse of doom. (and no, destro/amplify curse would not exist even so, no need to worry). It would still not work on PVP.<br>
<br>
If you do something like that, first you get a consistency of results from warlocks no matter how many you put in a raid. It might be OP for now, but keep in mind that I would expect with such a change to lower the COD dmg done, but all warlocks would get to use it. If you don't want it to tick for threat reasons, then refresh it - it has no cooldowns. Then again, you could try and patch up the lacking affliction dps. And hey - you would also give 'malediction' to non-COS users. How about that.<br>
<br>
That wouldn't address the mage raid synergy, but again, mage raid synergy is clunkier to do because there are many raid specs. It couldn't be done on ignite alone because that itself doesn't makes much sense. It would have to work with frost and arcane too.<br>

</div>Yes, hunters pay a lot from difficulty of play. Hunter dps is all over the place across guilds. It varies a lot more than mage dps does. A mage proper play is just exemplified by the fact that our 'cooldowns' (and I consider molten fury a cooldown) have a <i>huge</i> DPS impact. Plus - they stack. Our cooldown stacking is just much more apparent because our cooldowns boost our dps more, which is why theres a greater discrepancy across mage dps despise simple mechanics and ease of play. If other classes have cooldowns that equally increase their own dps by large amounts, they should get somewhat similar results.

I think the last blurt of questions was more out of Frustration....let me try to be more specific.  There are Parses where in one Brutallus attempt my DPS is terrible my Crit % much lower than my Character's base Crit, and I just wasn't performing up to my own expectations.  The next Attempt, however, will be exactly what is 'expected' from my gear, Cooldown Stacking, etc.  I'm trying to figure out how to "minimize" this effect so that, across 10 o more different attemps my DPS, Crit %, etc remains consistent (assuming all factors in each of those attempts are relatively equal:  IE:  Not having to Iceblock out of Burn, not having to move to Burn spot, having CoE up, etc).  I had one full night of fantastic attempts, and then on the kill....my DPS and overall performace was terrible and this upset me to no end.  How could that one attempt be such a terrible misrepresentation of my overall performance?  Yes, my guild understands to look at the 'whole picture' of all the attempts not just the 'kill' but this doesn't make me feel any better about my own personal expectations for my performace.  This boils down to me wondering....is there a minimum crit % that I should not fall below in order to have each sample parse show the same crit %?  Is there a minimum amount of Haste that I should keep in order to get 'almost' the same number of nukes off in each 6 minute attept (assuming all things are constant).  Or is all of this frustration as a result of the 'roll' system that enables some parses to have extremely high or low Crit % and something that I cannot/will not ever be able to control or minimize?  I'm pondering a better way to explain this, hopefully this helps a bit, I'll try to repost after next meeting.  Thanks again.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I like that idea a lot and to expand upon it and the idea of aggro limitation being a reason to refresh it instead of allowing it to tick off a way that you could use that to really increase Affliction's lagging dps would be to add additional aggro reduction to CoD associated with either Malediction or Unstable Affliction.  UA being preferable since the removal penalty is strictly a PvP effect they could give it a PvE side where it would also decrease the threat of all DoTs spells applied by the warlock by 20% while active, opening the door for them to be able to apply CoD on everything in PvE without any aggro issues provided they kept UA on the target at the same time.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_721242"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Well, as I see it atleast, when comparing warlocks and mages RNG just plays such a different role in the outcome of both classes.<br>
<br>
Mage dps is all about controlling cooldowns and stacking them together, this is what you can improve the most as a mage, so if you get lucky streaks at your cooldowns you do alot better, but if you get unlucky you will most certainly be very depressed at the results. It pains me we didn't get WWS of the Brutallus kill where I did 2400 dps with 4 resists and entirely expected crit rates, it's anecdoctal since I don't have it documented so I'll have to ask you to trust me on it. 4 resists are quite unlikely as I'm hit capped, but they happened at the beginning and not when I had my cooldowns stacked, and most of my crits where nicely timed and I had a nice spree of crits sub 20% with everything stacked.<br>
<br>
The point I bring that up is all the IF's that have to allign in the right way for mage dps to really shine, and they are all out of our hands. IF you crit during cooldowns with expected crit % and stack your cooldowns properly you will be able to do some amazing stuff. IF you get strings of crits during the &lt;20% period you get to do some crazy shit like 11k ignites. We rely on those things to fall into place properly to do good dps (or ofcourse we can just throw 3 heroisms to us and do well regardless of play)<br>
<br>
Compare this to warlock dps, IF crits land during ISB you'll get better numbers, and this is the only IF more or less - that IF is entirely out the question when your warlocks spec Fire anyway. I'm not really trying to dumb down warlocks, but their dps is just a much more steady and less reliant on RNG to do well. This will ofcourse mean that overall, almost regardless of gear, warlocks look better as their "optimal" play is pretty much guaranteed to be met each try (yes they can have shit RNG too and have bad tries and everything else that can go wrong).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_721292"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->First, thank you to all the mages that come to this forum and put in the time and effort to understand the class and help each other. It has been, and continues to be a wonderful resource. <br>
<br>
How the mage class stacks up against the other classes has been an issue that I have been thinking on for some time. There is no question that other classes give or garner more from raid synergies more then the mage class in its current incarnation. The suggestion from Manly would be a step in the right direction but I have started to wonder if there is a deeper issue involved. <br>
<br>
One of the things that skews the perception of the mage class is how differently it operates at different levels of progression. While part of this is spec differences I think there is a play style difference that is making it more difficult to see clearly. I have started to think after watching this class and others since opening day that the gap between good DPS and great DPS is much wider for the mage class then any other. While this may be only my perception it does seem that if I want to be competitive to other classes in DPS I have to hit everything just perfectly and hope that I don’t get a bad RNG string. Other classes appear to be able to have a less then perfect performance and not pay as much of a price. <br>
<br>
There is no question that the mage class can compete with other classes at the top level as there are plenty of WWS examples out there to show this. My point being that the skill to operate at this level appears to be much higher for mages then some other classes given a similar level of play time, gear, and knowledge. <br>
<br>
Given the current AoE discussion in this thread it could serve as an example. Hyjal packs are a pretty good barometer of the two main AoE classes and how they perform. In this scenario a Lock can alt-tab spam and take a nap and still have some very nice output with little concern for mana or CDs. A mage on the other hand will need to crank out everything he has while keeping a close eye on CDs to stay anywhere in the vicinity of the Lock output let alone exceed it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_721547"><!-- google_ad_section_start --><b>Regarding Destro lock vs Fire mage dmg</b><br>
<br>
First of all, this is about the classic destro build vs the classic fire build (90% of end lvl raiders use these builds).<br>
<br>
Brutallus is the most representative fight for destro lock/fire mage comparison. We are both stationary nukers. Mages do have a big advantage with IB though (If locks get burn they will lose 12 sec of DPS, while we will lose only 1-2 when IB`ing. So naturally, we would expect that fire mage DPS is higher on average than destro lock DPS (That is assuming we did equal DPS which we don't).<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, WWS average on Brutallus (Fire mage/Destro lock) show that destro locks do an average 10% more dps than fire mages. I made an average out of 20 parses (All destro locks/fire mages). I don't expect to find any significant difference in the % calculation even if I add 15 more parses, or 50 for that matter. Destro locks do 10% more dmg than Fire mages on average. If you doubt the statistics then I invite you to confirm this yourself (Add as many logs as you feel is enough, filter away the frost/arcane mages if you will. At the end of the day you will end up with about 10% difference between the average fire mage/destro lock. Statistics doesn't lie, so I don't understand how anyone can explain the 10% difference, other than the fact that the destro locks are hands down better at single target DPS (On an arena that is optimal to us - stationary). <br>
<br>
You can check Brutallus parses here and make your own average if you doubt the statistics: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080501142147/http://wowwebstats.com/?search=brutallus" target="_blank">Wow Web Stats</a> <br>

<br>
<br>
This is a quote from the Bosskiller brutallus guide btw, quite cheesy tbh: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080501142147/http://www.bosskillers.com/cgi-bin/bbguild/index.cgi?action=view_guide&amp;guide_id=344&amp;sid=nYyg9iuIni" target="_blank">Bosskillers World of Warcraft Bosses, Guides, Movie Reviews and Guild Kills</a><br>
<br>
<i>DPS: Limit to 5 melee DPS. <b>Warlocks</b> can prove very useful in numbers here and stacking for absolute maximum DPS will be needed.</i> <br>
<br>
Its a common consensus that destro locks on average beat fire mages on single target DPS (On an average fight). There are exceptions ofc, where our cycle based burst will result in overall superior dmg on certain encounters due to fight length or due to combat pauses (But again, thats not really representative).<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>A utility class</b><br>
<br>
To the next point. Do you think its a coincidence that Blizzard just buffed our survivability (IB), buffed our AoE, made decursing essential in the first SW fight, made all trash in SW humanoids, presented new spell stealable buffs? Do you really think they gave us all this and that they will make us as good on single target DPS as destro locks as well? <br>
<br>
Definitely not. This is a all planed and fits in perfectly with their new plan to make "niches". Just like they just "created" the pally tank by making it the best multitarget tank in game and a must at Felmyst. Its so obvious that they gave us the "utility" card (CC, AoE, decursing) and as a tradeoff we lose on single target DPS.  We started off as pure dps`ers but it would seem the devs have their own agenda. To me, its obvious by now that they are gradually developing mages to become a "utility class" by definition. <br>
<br>
Its really not complicated at all. If they wanted destro locks and fire mages to do equal DPS then they would have just improved the fireball modifier allready, in 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 or 2.4. Fireball is NOT a common arena spell so it wouldn't result in any implications in regards to PvP balance. The reason that they have done nothing to improve our single target DPS only underlines their intentions with our class. The reason that they haven't commented on this at all is because they know it would make ALOT of ppl furious. Not a single comment as far as I know regarding lock/mage single target DPS since the famous "Jaw dropping DPS" statement.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_721617"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Mage utility is a lot more gimicky than lock utility.<br>
<br>
Banish is the demon version of sheep. So, how much utility the two classes contribute in terms of CC depends solely on the type of setting and dungeon that Blizzard puts in the game. An all demon dungeon would see lock utility go up, and an all humanoid dungeon will see mage utility go up. <br>
<br>
Counterspell is especially gimicky. Only encounters that are designed specifically to require CS will need mages. And rogues and shammys can interrupt as well. So its not even unique to mage. <br>
<br>
Same for decurse. And mages aren't the only classes that can decurse. <br>
<br>
On the other hand. A lock's utility benefits in the most obvious way. It increases raid DPS. COE, COS both increase raid DPS, including the locks own DPS. So, there is a clear benefit that is not gimicky. it is used every single fight unlike stuff like CC or interupts.<br>
<br>
Same for lock healthstones. Everyone takes a healthstone. Simply because it is a constant assurance of a additional health potion on a different cooldown timer. You can have 3 locks, with different versions of healthstones, so you still get utility.<br>
<br>
Mages give the same AI buff to everyone, and the same free mana biscuits, which can all be done with just one mage. You don't get any additional utility for adding a mage. While you do when you add a lock.<br>
<br>
And SS. Its a uniquely lock utility. <br>
<br>
So, at the end of the day. Warlock utility is just so much more useful and commonly used than mage utility is. Mage utility is too gimmicky and dependent on dungeon design. Nothing to CS, spellsteal, or sheep. And mage utility plummets. Take the next expansion. Naxx will be a raid dungeon. And I bet the lich king's dungeon will also be filled with undead. Undead can't be sheeped. So, mage utility won't be anything to shout about in such settings.<br>
<br>
And mage AOE isn't really that much superior to lock AOE. Seed is quite competitive even to AE spam from an arcane mage in most situations and beats all other mage AOE quite handily. Plus it is far safer to cast seed from afar than it is to go up close to AE. But mages are forced to do so because this is their best AOE. Oddly enough. Mage AOE is good because of its snare aspects and because it helps to trigger seed. So, its the utility aspect of mage AOE that is good. Not so much that we are kings of AOE.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

You seem to be forgetting one very important point: yes, it’s a filler talent but in a part of the arcane tree that is mostly comprised of fillers anyway. Choosing between the bad and the worse to advance in that tree, it doesn’t seem such a bad deal over wasting those points somewhere else. They're at least invested into a talent that can arguably help your damage.</div>

</div>Well I probably worded my post bad, but what I meant to say was that because it is a filler talent, and because of the lack of AoE incoming damage that is resistible nowadays that talking about viable Magic Absorption included specs is a waste of time.<br>
<br>
If I were to spec Arcane in these days, Magic Attunement is a far better talent to get for raid helping.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_721820"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I've had my dps as destro warlock vary between 1400 and 2.6k (wiped the raind around 50% since shiny crits made me forget soulshatter) due to ISB uptime and crit varying between 5% and 45%. And it's quite commonplace to have crit rates 5-10% lower than expected. It's not that green here either but with all locks in raid being within 10% of expected crit I can keep a reasonable 1900 dps most of the time.<br>
And no, if done properly Burn isn't such a big dps loss for a warlock. Since our SP is a LW we stand close to the edge of Slash, I LT to have decent mana while moving with Burn and resume my dps. Also using moving back as LT time so I'm only wasting around 5 seconds max. Movement when not at full mana is never a dps loss for a warlock if it's not too long.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_721998"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'd like to draw our attention to a few facts I feel too many people are reading into events, making assumptions that I feel are out of place.<br>
<br>
Firstly, this whole argument starts from Andersnordic "they want destro locks to be king of single target DPS (With a relatively large margin)." and consequently that mages will not be.<br>
<br>
This is uncalled for. When did we ever get any feedback of the sort? I only ever recall BLIZZCON anouncements going along the lines of:<br>
<br>
ROGUES single target dps kings.<br>
MAGES AoE kings.<br>
WARLOCKS 1v1 duel kings.<br>
<br>
Not once since has a blue post ever addressed anything to overthrow or alter these; indeed, since then mages have only seen buffs including IV, removal of Tax. You may think CD-stacking nerf to be targetted at PvE but you are not fair in your assumption: Firstly, there is no commonality with any other class doing the same. No other class ever has had so many effects combined to produce such a hugely over-performing difference. Does it seem reasonable to you that there was a Blizzard meeting somewhere where they're all around a table going "ok, next year, mages are going to discover that if they combine EVERY BUFF KNOWN TO MAN, they'll produce 10kdps for 20sec. Everyone ok with that? Good, next topic...". It seems far more plausible to assume the nerf was (a) a pre-emptive prevention measure for new targetable buffs to come in the future (b) in the interests of commonality/consistency/obviousness. Whenever there's been a massive CD stacking possibility the only thing the game has gained has been one idiotic video on youtube and a torrent of QQ from uneducated, irrelevant players on forums demanding a nerf for something that almost never happens and almost never infulences anything.<br>
<br>
The fact that we did manage to combine and optimize all these effects is merely testament to the skill, drive and determination of TCers world-wide and excellent statisticians, simulation specialists and mages. I'm happy we got the CD-stacking nerf. Heaven forbid our class was reduced to a state where we sub-performed for all our careers BUT happened to breech top-dps by virtue of a fragile, situational, high-dependency massive stacking array on certain fights where it's feasible. I want mages to be accessible and playable by people who do not have an MSc in mathematics and don't spend all their non-gaming hours playing around with numbers. Can you immagine Blizzard benchmarking all mages on the assumptions we stack everything at the perfect time for us? It's known there are benchmarks, some more obvious than others (like, in a raid, a rogue -will- have a WF totem), but if our benchmark becomes too heavy it will simply prevent us from performing whenever one of those "ifs" doesn't apply.<br>
<br>
You all assume that because locks happen to escape earths gravity in DPS terms on Brutallus that blizzard always intended it to be so. This is madness; this is like primitive cultures turning to their spiritual leader every time it doesn't rain and deciding "we want rain, there is no rain, therefore God wants us to die.". Your assumption that (1) a system of interaction as enormous, cumbersome, and unprecedented as WoW can move and evolve at the speed you desire and find obvious, which in fact has absolutely nothing to do with any aspect of the game you come into contact with and (2) what you expect is not in the process of becoming a reality.<br>
<br>
Here's what you know: 2.4 is the last large patch before WotLK. In WotLK there will be a serious over-hauling of many, many things you consider to be given. How do I surmise this? Well for starts, BC was just that. I expect Blizz has enough cash to invest in the best minds possible to do as much as possible to Right the Wrongs. Did you notice the massive poll on "what do you want fixed about your class? That's exactly what I'm talking about.<br>
<br>
Let's assume, we're about to release 2.4 and internal testing shows on Brut locks are performing perhaps 10% more than we expect/want them to. What are our options as Blizzard International? Well, we can either get the damn thing going on live and finally divert the percentage of our Devs who were working on 2.4 onto WotLK where there's a whole shit-load of work to do, or, we can decide to re-align the role we have decided locks will have in end-game raiding, while keeping the balance for PvE low-end raiding, PvE 5mans/casual, leveling, BGs, low-end arenas and high-end arenas.<br>
<br>
I understand as much as anyone else the fact that currently, locks are above what we can aspire to. I understand this is a known fact by blizzard and I understand that we're on the threshold of a large amount of changes we are not privy to. Assuming automatically that because you don't see things being the way you want them/find them reasonable enough to be that this is proof blizzard have "decided locks will be better than mages" is not a particularly clever thing to do.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div><br>
I completely agree with your post and I would like to add an addendum in there.<br>
<br>
Lets think about why Warlocks might be doing better on Brutallus then Mages.  What changes during that encounter that might cause Warlocks to go beyond their normal dps?  Well, many guilds are giving their locks shadowpriests and resto shaman to limit lost dps due to lifetap.  <br>
<br>
Why would that be abnormal?  Well giving a class that has no NEED for a shadowpriest one of them is directly outside of what Blizzard is most likely using for benchmarks.  Why give a class that can regen mana at will a mana battery?<br>
<br>
I'm betting when Blizzard balanced Mages for current raiding they planned on them being grouped with a shadowpriest.  Locks were most likely balanced in the absence of one, which really does make alot of sense.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<u>Miscellaneous rambling <i>somewhat</i> offtopic. </u><br>
What I've been thinking lately is that they need to completely rethink the current group/raid system.  Take all the buffs that are currently confined to groups and change them to function on a raid-wise basis.  So shaman totems would affect anyone in the raid within range of the totem,  VE/VT would also affect the whole raid and so would Ferocious Inspiration.  Even Bloodlust/Heroism would affect everyone in the raid.  <br>
<br>
How would that balance out?  Just place a limited range on all the buffs and have some of the buffs apply a debuff to limit their "up time" to whatever level the developers are interested in.  So have Bloodlust affect every raid member within 20 yards of the shaman and when it fades apply a 5 or a 10 minute (depending on how acceptable double lusts during a single encounter is to the developers) debuff to prevent it from affecting raid members again.  Something like Ferocious Inspiration would probably require that you have the buff radiate from both the pet and the hunter for a certain distance, like 10 yards.  Moonkin Aura would also have a limited range and so would Pally Auras.  This would remove the need to setup groups to idealize buffs but would instead change the focus to raid member placement to maximize benefits.<br>
<br>
The real advantage to changing to that type of system is that you would begin balancing an encounter on the assumption that everyone has every buff that they are able to be in range to get.  Then you take classes with a support buff and can balance their raid contribution based on some norm quantity minus their raid support contribution.  Ferocious Inspiration is probably the easiest example to use for that type of balancing, so FI would give 3% additional damage to all raid members in range of either the pet or the hunter while active, so you would take the "norm" raid dps contribution and subtract 3% for what they are giving to others.  <br>
<br>
Even balancing VE/VT becomes easier since you would just be counting on everyone in the raid gaining the benefit if they are able to stay in range of the shadowpriest.  Then you would decrease the shadowpriest's personal dps to a level that accounts for the other benefits they bring to the raid. <br>
<br>
Changing the buffs to work like that would also help with balancing the BGs especially when Pubbies are involved.  Currently if I go into a BG solo on my enhancement shaman I have no way of determining who will be near me to get benefits from my totems or who will get lusted if I pop it since unless I am group leader and take the time to talk to my party everyone will be going their own way and that is one of the unbalanced aspects of a pubbie facing a premade.  If the buffs were changed to affect everyone in the raid within a certain radius I would be able to just look around at the allies near me and drop totems to much better affect.<br>
<br>
It also just simply makes more sense (yes, I understand the illogic of making that statement while discussing a game where people throw fireballs at dragons) since if an allied warrior near me battleshouts then shouldn't it buff me just for being near enough to him to hear it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>That would all depend on how the aggro from VE was determined and also the range that VE would be determined to work at.  Currently it works at something like 100 yards from the shadowpriest but if it was to work raid-wide then it probably be be given a much smaller radius of action.<br>
<br>
They could also balance it by using something similar to how AE caps work.  Giving it a defined cap and then having the regen split evenly among all those affected up to that cap.  So lets say the Shadowpriest was putting out 1600dps which would mean the VE would be healing people for 400hp/s.  If they capped the hp/s at 2400hp/s then if everyone in the raid (all 25) was in range of the shadowpriest they would all be healed for 96hp/s and then if 10 of them were to move out of range (leaving 15 people affected) the hp/s would jump to 160hp/s.<br>
<br>
That way the threat would have a clearly defined cap that the raid designers would be able to keep in mind when designing an encounter.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

The new epic gem in 2.4.2: Purified Shadowsong Amethyst (+healing/spirit). Anyone looked at this for mages yet? "But it's a healer gem" you say. It's also, indirectly, a +dmg/Spirit gem, except it's got 4dmg instead of 6. Currently, for gnome arcane mages that stack int, +10spr gems are the best for blue sockets, in a mana-limited fight, by my calculations in Rawr.Mage. However, ripping blue gems from the hands of healers and tanks isn't a very easy thing to do, so many have been using 5int/2mp5 green gems instead. Well, with my current Rawr.Mage character, it's significantly better than the 5int/2mp5 green, though still not as good as the 10spr. Think we'll start seeing mages with healing gems?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Not sure, but I would think that since it wouldn't be considered.<br>
<br>
I believe +12dmg is still greater than the new gem for the red slots, and +10 spirit is as you say, better than it as well, so that's it out for blue slots.<br>
<br>
10int is also better than that gem, so that's it out for all 3 colours.<br>
<br>
I could be wrong about the +12dmg though, so it still is possible...<br>
<br>
It'll be a bit crazy for mages to start using healing gems though XD<br>

		<div id="post_message_723141"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Well like I said, it'd only be in situations where you couldn't get epic blue gems (since those are in such high demand by tanks and healers). It's certainly not optimal, but at least it's better than the Dazzling or the Sparkling Star of Elune that some of us used due to our guilds having tons of greens and no reds/blues (and depending on whether or not we got iDS or not; we don't, so Dazzling was better).<br>
<br>
Currently for me (this will vary alot by character/buffs/fight duration, but this is for a gnome arcane mage in T5/T6/2.4Badge gear, on a 360sec fight)...<br>
<br>
With no DS:<br>
Sparkling = 6.76 dps<br>
Purified = 6.44 dps<br>
Dazzling = 5.98 dps<br>
Sparkling Star of Elune = 5.53 dps<br>
<br>
With iDS:<br>

		<div id="post_message_723206"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Running all this stuff through Rawr and playing with different gems I can't see why you would want to equip an spirit gem over a damage gem.  The Int gem is a bit up in the air (especially if you are a gnome) but I would still rather equip a haste/damage gem over a int gem just because spec viability changes whenever a blizzard developer gets the sniffles and the haste/damage gem will be good under every circumstance possible while the Intellect gem will only really shine under very specific circumstances.<br>
<br>
To be more specific about the Spirit gem versus a Damage gem.  I'm playing 40/0/21 and I use a glowing shadowsong in my legs for the meta gem requirements.  If I changed it to a sparkling sapphire it would give me all of 0.11dps additional on Brutallus, which would be a 0.00487% increase in overall dps or basically so insignificant as to mean absolutely nothing.  Which all seems to imply to me that for a mage you should still gem for damage and haste instead of int, spirit and mana/5 even if you are specced 40/0/21.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Haste and Arcane blast don't go together too well if you combine AB with further haste cooldowns. It just means that you go under the GCD which means wasted haste.<br>
<br>
So yes, for socket bonuses, if ur arcane and are haste capped the int and spi would be better I believe.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I know farming heroic blood furnace is a pain, but I'd rate it over the new gem.  In fact Rawr has that gem marginally better than a +9 dmg gem for me(7.24 v 7.21).<br>
<br>
Edit:  Checked Rawr, it doesn't automatically add the +damage from +healing gems, and adding in Purified shadow pearl (9 heal 4 spirit) initially doesn't rate highly, but editing it to have the 3 damage from the + healing, Rawr rates it over glowing shadowsong amethyst, although not as good as a sparkling star of elune.<br>
<br>
Further edit:  Rawr actually rates <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33281" target="_blank">[Brooch of Nature's Mercy]</a> as the best amulet for me (arcane/frost) pre pendant of sunfire.  Went through and added some of the better healing/spirit items in slots that don't have equivalent damage items (neck/ring/offhand/wand/back) and I couldn't find anything else where the healing item was better, except shroud of the highborne, which rawr rates the best for every mage build (this was just eyeballing changing my current spec without changing gear).<br>
<br>
I do wonder how much better arcane would be if there where items available to them for amulet/ring/weapon/wand/cape with better stat balance for the build (ie native spirit).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Ah, good point. But it's 4dmg, not 3. Whether it's better than Sparkling Star of elune, as I said a post ago, depends on if you have iDS (and probably other gear as well, and fight duration, etc)<br>

EDIT: Added <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30600" target="_blank">[Fluorescent Tanzanite]</a>. Great idea! That's indeed the best blue gem, even better than Sparkling Empyrean Sapphire for me, but almost a whole dps (without iDS).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_723618"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'm still conflicted over the value of haste for a 40/0/21 build.<br>
<br>
There are two arguments commonly used against it:<br>
<br>
1) It will reduce you cast times below the GCD when stacked with other cooldowns<br>
2) It involves sacrificing dpm, as all other stats give improved dpm while haste does not<br>
<br>
The first one is, as far as I can tell, not a huge issue for relatively low amounts of haste. To determine the effective haste cap, you would need to figure out how much haste is required to reduce the spell casting time to the GCD. For arcane blast spam, this is roughly 33.5% haste. Assuming haste is additive, this gives you a leeway of 3.5% haste (or 54 haste rating) until haste is lost during bloodlust. If you have drums active on a regular basis, however, all of the benefit from haste rating is lost during bloodlust. Icy veins (assuming its not stacked with bloodlust, because it generally should not be for arcane) gives you a cap of 13.5% haste, or 8.5% with drums up.<br>
<br>
(Note that spell haste may be mutiplicative rather than additive with outside modifiers such as bloodlust. This would change the numbers a bit, giving you a leeway of 5.5% haste during bloodlust, or 0.5% haste with drums and bloodlust up).<br>
<br>
So how significant is the lost haste during bloodlust? How does it effect the relative value of haste as a stat? Assuming that an average fight is 5 minutes, you would lose thirty seconds of the benefit of your haste rating, or one tenth of the fight. So ignoring dpm issues for the moment, any time 1 haste &gt; 1.1 damage or 1.1 crit, haste would still be the preferred stat.<br>
<br>
As far as the dpm thing goes, I'm not sure what the best way to model is would be. Anyone have any thoughts?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_723706"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->All this discussion of haste can get technical, however, there is one thing you can quickly and easily establish:<br>
<br>
Fully debuffed and with BL and IV, AB drops to 0.96sec cast. Some prefer to switch to Fbolt at this stage, however on the premises that my 214ms latency and 13fps will probably inject more than 0.04sec latency anyhow I stick with AB. Let alone the fact that even with 4% wasted, ABdebuff-SCB-Hex-AP-IV-Destro-T5 AB is massively more compacted in terms of CD stacking than Fbolt could ever be. Not to mention fantastic DPM (for arcane). And I consider T5 a Cooldown in terms of altering game mechanics purely in DPM terms; the cost increase given the damage increase is pathetic and so is AP's. 1sec casts that hit for 3.8k and crit 6700? at circa 1140mana/cast. Given 33%crit rate (added 3 for clearcasts). Unless my math is flawed makes for 4.14dpm. Decent for AB.<br>
<br>
The 0.96sec issue effectively means you are getting zero from any haste during CD stacking. Granted, for Brutallus this may not be that-much of an issue for you, but remember a lot of fights have phasing and a lot of fights have aggro issues. Not every boss is Terron, meaning CD-stack is often a larger chunk of your actual dps-time than sims would have you believe. Off CDs, it's a DPM hindrance in that it could have been providing more manaregen/damage/evocate/crit/innervate via int/spi or more efficiency via pure dmg, or even the pathetically unworthy crit. Even the most favourable sims have haste as a teensy-weensy bit better in only dps terms for fire, which is optimal for haste. I'd be amazingly impressed if anyone managed to prove haste being any good at all for arcane.<br>
<br>
As far as I'm concerned, haste is a brilliant idea if you (a) are fire, (b) do not have to drop damage consumables for mana consumables because of it, (c) have enough to make your Skull-IV-BL+other CD stacking give you some funky ignites (refer to appropriate thread for aprox. amount) and (d) have such gear that it's unavoidable and even assuming 1haste = 0.95dmg (as a worst case scenario) you're still better off than your previous gear. Like swapping say, a Vestments of the Sea Witch for a Sunfire Robe.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_723837"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->CD stacking and haste lead to some strange things in Rawr.<br>
<br>
I tested some stuff in 2/48/11.<br>
1247 dmg, hitcapped, 4T6, Hex/SCB, 94 haste give me 1760 dps over 300sec<br>
and haste gems ~= +dmg gems<br>
 <br>
Switching to increase haste rating to 110<br>
1244 dmg, hitcapped, 4T6, Hex/SCB, 110 haste give me 1812 dps over 300sec :p<br>
and haste gems ~= 3x +dmg gems<br>
<br>
It looks like SCB and another cooldown to stack is the reason of that, as switching to Skull instead of SCB is showing again almost equally powerful haste and damage gems.<br>
<br>
According my experiments with Rawr and ingame, I still have difficulties gemming haste instead of +dmg, even for fire spec. If the slot is yellow, I go dmg/haste, thats all.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_723984"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I have been playing with the 40/10/11 build lately.  We run 3 mages minimun with an ele shammy and shadow priest.  Two mages are 40/10/11 and one is 2/48/11.  The two arcane mages do like 40 less dps then they did when they was 40/0/21 with a wc mage.  The deep fire mage has a 120 dps increased dps as fire compared to deep ice. We call him the scorch biatch now. <br>
<br>
Basically we sacrificed some personal dps for overall raid dps.  This has worked well.  With the new spirit/int changes we have to cast very little fire.  We cast fire when we have bloodlust and icyveins.  The arcane mages have been stacking whatever gems rawr recommends for the most dps over a 300 sec fight.  I managed to cast arcane blast on the majority of the supremus fight last night for a grand total of slightly over 500k last night.  I am very pleased as an arcane/fire/frost mage with the 2.4 changes.  I think I need to research the 0/40/21 build more for our deep fire mages though.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_724531"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I’ve been messing around over the past few days with haste vs. spell damage, trying to retool my gear. The main question I wanted to answer was: When does a <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=35761" target="_blank">[Quick Lionseye]</a> add more dps than a <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32196" target="_blank">[Runed Crimson Spinel]</a>? <br>
<br>
I did a lot of math and worked with Vontre’s spreadsheet a lot, and after a lot of experimenting here’s what I found. My numbers may not be on the nose, but should work as a rule of thumb. <br>
<br>
Intellect, Spirit and Spell Crit have a very, very minimal impact as to whether 12 Spell Damage or 10 Spell Haste provides better dps. I also assumed for my calculations that the mage is 2/48/11 and hit capped, as well as raid buffed (Flask of Pure Death, Basilisk, Wizard Oil). <br>
<br>
There’s effectively a “haste cap”, at which point 12 SD and 10 Haste are equal in terms of DPS. That cap varies based (almost entirely) on how much spell damage you have. The below equation applies to Fireball spam only, and because of Empowered Fireball giving more weight to SD over Haste, for all other spells (scorch, fireblast, etc.) haste becomes more valuable at lower levels of spell damage (I believe). <br>
<br>
<br>
(SD – 1138) * 0.8 = Haste Cap <br>
<br>
<br>
SD here is your unbuffed Spell Damage. If your total spell haste is below the haste cap, 12 SD gems will be worse than 10 spell haste. If you’re above it, 12 SD is better. Now trinket usage and Wrath of Air Totem change this, so I experimented with some different trinkets, and you can modify your “SD” number in the above based on the following: <br>
<br>
Wrath of Air Totem: Add 101 to SD. <br>
<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=31856" target="_blank">[Darkmoon Card: Crusade]</a>: Add 77 to SD. <br>
<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33829" target="_blank">[Hex Shrunken Head]</a>: Add 35 to SD. <br>
<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30720" target="_blank">[Serpent-Coil Braid]</a>: Add 28 to SD. <br>
<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29370" target="_blank">[Icon of the Silver Crescent]</a>: Add 25 to SD. <br>
<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32483" target="_blank">[The Skull of Gul'dan]</a>: Subtract 48 from SD. <br>
<br>
<br>
Example: Say my mage is at 1027 Spell Damage unbuffed. For most raid bosses, I use the <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30720" target="_blank">[Serpent-Coil Braid]</a> and the <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=31856" target="_blank">[Darkmoon Card: Crusade]</a>. Without Wrath of Air Totem: <br>
<br>
<br>
(1027 + 28 + 77 - 1138) * 0.8 = -4.8 <br>
<br>
<br>
So if I don’t have Wrath of Air, 12 SD is better for me than 10 haste. If I do have WoA: <br>
<br>
<br>
(1027 + 28 + 77 + 101 -1138) * 0.8 = 76 <br>
<br>
<br>
Here, once I reach 76 spell haste, <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=35761" target="_blank">[Quick Lionseye]</a> and <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32196" target="_blank">[Runed Crimson Spinel]</a> provide about the same DPS.  Depending on whether I have WoA, the “haste cap” varies by 80.8. Some other notes: Haste is better than crit for dps by a wide margin, so any hybrid gems that had crit should now be the haste versions with the new gem cuts out. Heroism and/or Drums lower the effectiveness of haste (compared to spell damage) slightly, as well. Also, there are other passive differences that should be taken into consideration when gemming for hit. Remember that other spells have a different "haste cap". And while haste may give you more dps, you can’t go as long before you go oom, etc.<br>
<br>

<br>
With Bloodlust active you need 244 haste to get AB down to a 1 second cast.<br>
<br>
With Icy Veins active you need 393 (392.5 to be precise) haste to get AB down to 1 second.<br>
<br>
With Icy Veins and Bloodlust active you need 384 to get Frostbolt down to 1 second.<br>

So even if you have the Skull of Gul'dan you would be able to make use of Spell haste up to a rating of 209 in regards to stacking cooldowns.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Not sure, but I would think that since it wouldn't be considered.<br>
<br>
I believe +12dmg is still greater than the new gem for the red slots, and +10 spirit is as you say, better than it as well, so that's it out for blue slots.<br>
<br>
10int is also better than that gem, so that's it out for all 3 colours.<br>
<br>
I could be wrong about the +12dmg though, so it still is possible...<br>

Haste and Arcane blast don't go together too well if you combine AB with further haste cooldowns. It just means that you go under the GCD which means wasted haste.<br>

So yes, for socket bonuses, if ur arcane and are haste capped the int and spi would be better I believe.</div>

Well aside from the totally awesome mana vaccuum it creates, haste is effective up to approximately 263 rating (rounded up from 262.554) at which point you hit 1.0s with IV up, without IV you will not be at the GCD.  The only time you will drop below GCD and waste haste (so to speak) is with Heroism/BL and you can reduce this cap if you'd like to account for that (and further reduce by 80 if you have 4 leatherworking fiends with drums!).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Because everyone is debating about the cap, I'm gonna show you my math here so that I'm not just throwing around a random number.  I did this all with very simple ratios and cross multiplying for instance:<br>
<br>
 1.0s =  80%<br>
 x     =  100%  Solve for x by doing (1.0s x 100%) / 80% = x<br>
<br>
assuming 1.0s is ideal timing for ramped AB cast we know that approx 1575 haste = 100% and we know that the 20% increase from IV is what (in my model) would put us at 1.0s so therefore our cast time needs to be at a time that will reduce to 1.0s when IV is activated.<br>
<br>
so assuming that 80% of our target = 1.0s then 100% = x (the target cast time). thus 100 / 80 = 1.25s.  This means we need our base cast time (1.5s) reduced by .25s. <br>
<br>
if 100% cast time = 1.5s we need to determine what amount of haste will reduce us by .25s.  the ratio we're using is 1575 rating = 100% reduction. so we have to convert .25s into a percentage of 1.5s.  so (.25 x 100) / 1.5 = 16.666...%<br>
<br>
if 1575 = 100% reduction, then (575 x 16.6666...%) / 100 = haste rating needed = 262.5 hate rating.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

With Icy Veins and Bloodlust active you need 384 to get Frostbolt down to 1 second.<br>
<br>
So even if you have the Skull of Gul'dan you would be able to make use of Spell haste up to a rating of 209 in regards to stacking cooldowns.</div>

<br>
(1 + (Haste Rating/1570)) x (1 + Haste Effects) = 1 + Total Haste<br>
<br>
(1 + (HR/1570)) x 1.2 = 1.5<br>
<br>
1 + (HR/1570) = 1.25<br>
<br>
HR/1570 = 0.25<br>
<br>
HR = 392.5<br>
<br>
So 392.5 spell haste rating is required to drop a fully debuffed Arcane Blast down to the GCD with just Icy Veins in effect.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_726295"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'm relatively new to these boards as a poster, but I would  like to share my thoughts on the stats evaluation for arcane. Being an (the only) arcane mage myself in a relatively high end guild (working on Twins), I found it very difficult to judge how much exactly 1 int/spi/haste/crit is worth compared to +1 dmg. So I decided to make a  relatively simple model (in Mathematica) for a concrete fight like Brutallus. I'll explain the model briefly, and then show the results that were quite surprising to me at least. <br>
<br>
As arcane you use almost exclusively 2 spells, which is frostbolt and 3stack arcane blast. Given a fight of length T, you can calculate, based on your personal stats, the total amount of mana M that you have available to spend in the fight. If we call the amount of ab's you cast x, and the amount of frostbolts y, there is a best value for x and y that maximizes your total damage done (subject to the time and mana constraints). This is a simple linear programming problem which can be solved easily. As an example, if the fight is very long, you'll be forced to cast relatively many frostbolts to save up on mana, but if the fight is short you can spam ab exclusively. The relative worth of each stat is then calculated by changing that stat slightly and noting the change in total damage done.<br>
<br>
Using as input my own stats, and assuming all standard raid buffs and consumables, and a relatively "standard group" (for me at least ) of spriest/resto shaman, I get the following results:<br>
<ul><li>1 dmg := 1</li>
<li>1 int = 1.312</li>
<li>1 spi = 0.981</li>
<li>1 crit rating = 0.732</li>
<li>1 haste rating = 0.997</li>
</ul><br>
Two things surprised me in this. Haste is not quite as bad as I thought it would be considering arcane is such a mana intensive spec. I deliberately passed on all haste gear in Sunwell so far because I believed it wouldn't add a lot to my dps. The second remarkable result is that int is very effective. Int adds more damage through mindmastery, more crit, more total mana, more passive regen through the new 2.4 regen formula, and more mana back from evocation/mana tides. Based on this information, I'm probably going to socket all yellow slots with 10 int gems from now on.<br>
<br>
I should note that this is also assuming that you use mana pots/gems on cd, evocate once, and receive 1 innervate from a druid. But without an innervate it would only increase the value of int/spi even more.<br>
<br>
I also compared my results with Rawr. It more or less agrees for the value of haste/crit, but it values spi/int much lower. I don't know why this is. I'm not too familiar with the workings of the mage model of Rawr, so I can't comment on this.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>If you just look at the mana added to your pool, it's not impressive. It shows up as high ranking because it affects every damage stat besides haste. Socketing a 10 int gem at 750 int and 320 spi--fairly low stats, if you're stacking int/spi, you'll be in the 870/450 range with raid bufs--gives (assuming BoK):<br>
<br>
* 12.65 intellect (non-gnome)<br>
* 189.75 mana<br>
* 3.43 OOCmp5 or 2.06 mp5<br>
* 113.85 mana from evo (151.8 2t6)<br>
* .16% crit<br>
* 3.16 +damage (4.05 +dam spellfire)<br>
<br>
Assuming a 6 minute (300 second) fight, the total contribution to your mana is 189.75+113.85+2.06*(300/5) = 436.2 mana, or about 2/3 of a fully stacked AB, which is a significant amount from a single gem, not to mention the +dam/crit equivalent to a <a class="q2" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=23101" target="_blank">[Potent Flame Spessarite]</a>.<br>
<br>
Stacking int, in turn, makes spirit a better stat. Socketing a 10 spirit gem yields:<br>
<br>
* 450 int: 6.53 mp5<br>
* 550 int: 7.22 mp5<br>
* 650 int: 7.85 mp5<br>
* 750 int: 8.43 mp5<br>
* 850 int: 8.97 mp5<br>
<br>
So the two sort of grow together.<br>
<br>
Naturally if you never run out of mana (you're chain-innervated, fight is short, extended interruptions, etc) and can spam AB indefinitely, the relative value of spirit drops like a rock, int is reduced to its pure damage stats, and the dps contribution of the various stats comes to look more or less like it does for fire and frost.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_727209"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Just out of curiosity, is there a reason behind calculating the spell haste cap for 1 second AB spam while under the effects of IV and not for BL/Heroism? For short enough fights the time spent under the effects of Bloodlust and Icy Veins are equal assuming that one of the abilities doesn't have remaining duration at the end of the boss fight. In longer fights assuming that mages only receive one bloodlust (an arcane mage could arguably handle several effectively assuming they were able to get an innervate.) and the number of uses of IV increases it probably makes more sense to increase your spell haste beyond the threshold for Bloodlust.<br>
<br>
Does anyone know if Rawr or any other tool has a module that's able to calculate the gain/loss of increasing your spell haste beyond any of the caps? Basically all it would need to do is add up the amount of time spent below the global cooldown waiting to cast again and compare it to the amount of time gained while not under those conditions. With that data we could probably derive a simple formula to take into account exactly how much the value of spell haste decays when compared to other stats. <br>
<br>
It's probably not as much of an issue now, but as more gear becomes available in Sunwell it becomes somewhat difficult to avoid stacking spell haste.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_727427"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Alright, this may not be the thread for this question but I figure that this is probably the best place to get mages that know what they are talking about to answer it so here it goes. My guild, like most, has always given mages a shadow priest over other casters dating back to the days of 2/5 T5 arcane mages with mana problems. However, recently I watched our Brutallus kill video from one of our fire mages POV's and noticed that with a shadow priest and resto shaman in the group he never went below 50% mana and this was while using Molten Armor and Destruction Potions (0 mana potions). We run a ret pali and have JoW up constantly which probably helped him too. <br>
<br>
So my question is this, do full-T6 level geared fire mages really need a shadow priest? From what I can tell, if your not having mana problems standing still nuking for 6 straight minutes on Brutallus you probably wouldn't have them on most other fights. Is there something I'm missing here, or maybe he just really lucky in the video with JoW procs/mana gem crits?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_727440"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Now that gems and odd gear choices have been addressed somewhat, just a quick note regarding weapon enchants: It appears that many people running a 40/0/21 or such choose a +40 spell damage enchant. <br>
<br>
However, let's make an odd choice here as well: It is clear that (very naively put) as soon as around 80% of one's casts are arcane blast, Sunfire is just as good*. This totally leaves cooldown stacking out of the picture. If Arcane Power/Icy Veins (Icy Veins just increases the benefit from AP in this case) is taken into account, I imagine the break even point to be clearly lower. <br>
<br>
Now the only thing to do is to take a look at individual WWS reports and make an educated decision?<br>
<br>
*:<br>
50*x + 0*(1-x)  &gt; 40*x + 40 * (1-x) where x is the number of arcane blasts.<br>
<br>
x&gt;40/50<br>
<br>
(Edit) Note: Actually the calculation is not complete. Frostbolts "receive" slightly more Damage bonus (per cast) because they crit for 225%, however on the other hand they receive a 5% penalty due to their chill effect. Even if we take a maledicted CoS into account this slightly shifts the favor in the direction of the +40 Spelldamage enchant. Nevertheless the point remains.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Alright, this may not be the thread for this question but I figure that this is probably the best place to get mages that know what they are talking about to answer it so here it goes. My guild, like most, has always given mages a shadow priest over other casters dating back to the days of 2/5 T5 arcane mages with mana problems. However, recently I watched our Brutallus kill video from one of our fire mages POV's and noticed that with a shadow priest and resto shaman in the group he never went below 50% mana and this was while using Molten Armor and Destruction Potions (0 mana potions). We run a ret pali and have JoW up constantly which probably helped him too. <br>
<br>
So my question is this, do full-T6 level geared fire mages really need a shadow priest? From what I can tell, if your not having mana problems standing still nuking for 6 straight minutes on Brutallus you probably wouldn't have them on most other fights. Is there something I'm missing here, or maybe he just really lucky in the video with JoW procs/mana gem crits?</div>

</div>They would go oom without the shadow priest.  Letting them flamecap and destro pot is a signficant amount of dps, especially if you lust beloe 20% boss hp.  If he was using mana gems, which I doubt, then he was wrong to use them.  Now youre talking about Sunwell, so do mages need a spriest to decurse, max dps on brutallus, and aoe on Felmyst?  Yes.  Where else is the spriest going to go that benefits the raid more?  Not really anywhere.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Warlocks receive a tremendous boost from shadow priests.  So raising the question of whether it's a good idea to put the fire mages in the spriest group is a good one.<br>
<br>
@seferis<br>
Interesting... And have you done the calculations on Spellsurge?  How many arcane mages in a group would have to have spellsurge to make it worthwhile?  Especially if you use the weapon swap addon?  I'd do it myself, but I'm not arcane, and don't understand the spec as well as you, I suspect.<br>
<br>
@Ammanas<br>
In my guild, we usually have the destro locks/arcane mages with the spriest, and I find as a fire mage, I'd rather be using my party slots for boomkin/resto shaman (or elem if possible).  While these may not be optimal for a raid, some raids use them.  And given the choice between an spriest and a resto shaman, I'll go with the resto shaman (WOA, BL, and mana tide, coupled with not always having 100% dps time due to movement), and leave the spriest for the other classes.  So I would answer your question by saying "fire mages *benefit* from shadow priests, but you really have to thoroughly examine your raid composition to get a meaningful answer."<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Smog - Mana gained by Vampiric Touch - 23,985<br>
Figs - 18194<br>
Manly - 20694<br>
<br>
No other outside source brought more than 6000 mana (manly's JoW, excluding that 4000)<br>
<br>
You may see a mage with half mana, but do tell me where he can find 20,000 or so mana. A smart evocation is 8k mana (~100 dps), 3 super manas is 7200 (~80 dps loss).<br>
<br>
Yes, you could technically put them in group 5, but get ready to lose 180 or so dps just in terms of mana compensating.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_727737"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Strictly speaking, you should be getting an SP -and- a shaman at the same time. Failing that, I'd rather have a shaman than an SP as a firemage. With the exception of Brutallus.<br>
<br>
While answering the question "do firemages really need an SP?" is valid, the question you should be answering is "how can the raid change to accommodate better RDPS" or more likely "swap firemage with X". <br>
<br>
Or respec all your mages arcane, drop CoE for another CoD, SP/Rshaman for everyone, with SP/Eshaman for the locks.<br>
<br>
<br>
Edit: Searix does have a point in terms of quantity of mana returned. The fact that with an SP you're never "low" doesn't mean you'd be "above 0" without one. At this level it truly is the case that prologued SP regen is many times more than any other comparable regen. It's such that we're either overflowing with one, or strained without one.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_727738"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I personally raid as Arcane/frost, gathering up gear to go Fire versus Brutallus, as all my models hint at an increasing superiority of fire as ilvl 156 gear steps into the game, making 2 pieces of T5 obsolete.<br>
However, with the recent changes in mana regeneration mechanics, and talking to our resto druids, i've found out Innervate is not as important to healers as it was pre-2.4.<br>
<br>
I therefore asked one of our druids to put Innervate on me during bossfights where he doesn't need it, with a result of a net increase in my dps, allowed mainly by the fact i can spam AB during all cooldowns, opposed to the ability of doing it only for the first AP/IV use or so.<br>
By having 2 innervates this became even more clear, as i hardly had to use any frostbolt during these fights.<br>
<br>
Even though anedoctal evidences are not something i've ever trusted, this made a question arise: is it possible, and how many innervates are needed for an arcane/frost spec to deal more DPS than a fire one - given the best gear available?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I think spellsurge has been addressed somewhat in other threads. It is a 15% Proc with a 30sec cooldown.<br>
<br>
Anyway, an option is to just switch weapons when casting frostbolts. Then the issue boils down to whether you want 40 spelldamage or spellsurge.<br>
<br>
Obviously, since the 20% of your casts that are Frostbolts <br>
- are likely cast when you are short of mana<br>
- and you will not stack cooldowns during these 20%<br>
it is an interesting choice to swap to a spellsurge weapon when casting Frostbolts.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_727768"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I am almost certain Spellsurge is a 45sec (since 2.1) and not a 30sec CD. Even so, it's effect can be easily simulated. Take it as given that by 55sec it will have procced, divide mana return by 11, there's the effective mp5 gain per spellsurge. Run simulator and add that much mp5 to your SPs regeneration, see DPS increase. If it's more than negligible, which I doubt, you then have to establish how much damage you're losing by not having a damage enchant on, which means you'll have to calculate how many spells go off before surge procs (and hence you swap weapon), and then you have to input conditionals like "if cooldowns are going off, don't swap" and "swap late enough so as to ensure spellsurge CD is up only outside AB part of rotation" and all sorts of utopian malarkey which even though may be possible to simulate by a machine is utterly impossible to in fact perform...<br>
<br>
I'd doubt spellsurge will make any noticeable difference. The amount of mana it returns is very small, and it becomes especially small when compared to the vast amount we're regenning from passive regen, JoW, SP, Mana tide and gems.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

The tests lasted just 2 minutes and SCB seemed to have a small DPS lead. In cases where a flame cap wasn't used the SCB combo was the clear winner.<br>

</div>The amount of mana gained for yourself might be very low, but what about the effect on your group - and what if you are stacking the enchant in your group? I play with a shadow, a resto sham, a moonkin + another mage or a warlock as a 40/0/21 (thats why it seems interesting for me, as a firemage I wouldn't care). Assuming that I am the only one with the enchant, it would be 500-600 mana for a 5 minute encounter (I suck at math, so just approximations for me :P). Assuming the whole group is using an addon for swapping, it would be like an extra super mana for everyone. And imho it wouldn't be a problem that it is such a small amount of regenerated mana compared to the other regsources, as an AB spammer I'm happy about everything I can get (lf druid who is monitoring my manapool and provides me with innervate :P).<br>
<br>
Since I have two nearly equal mainhands (Zul'Jin hasteblade - too bad that it is unique - and Fang of the Leviathan), the idea of two enchants doesn't sound bad to me. But if (stacked) spellsurge isn't really worth it, soulfire/soulfrost looks like the better alternative to me.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_728845"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Okay, so, I admit I'm not perfect at theorycrafting, so could use some help at seeing if I've been modeling mana gains on arcane mages.<br>
<br>
Basically, what I did was this (assuming you weren't trading anything for mana, as in the case of giving an arcane mage an innervate).<br>
<br>
The value of mana/damage can be said to be:<br>
X= Cost of fully debuffed arcane blast + 2/5 frostbolt (because this is 2.5 second cast time, replacing your frostbolt).<br>
Y= cost of frostbolt.<br>
A=Damage of arcane blast + 2/5 frostbolt<br>
B= damage of frostbolt.<br>
<br>
So for every X-Y mana, you gain A-B damage?<br>

		<div id="post_message_728936"><!-- google_ad_section_start --><b>Cornelium, xiaoxin21:</b> A rather vague and over-optimistic if not impossible scenario. Innervate is a flat DPS boost for arcane. The only reason you may see it conceivable as "assume unlimited" is because never before has it been considered as a dps-boosting mechanic. You are more likely to gain chain-BLs than you are to be chain-innervated, and even if you are chain-innervated it will only be because you are the only arcane mage.<br>
<br>
Ultimately, the question you pose fails at being too open and with no discernible purpose. It's like asking what's the best car, given money no issue... Well, it depends. Even though probably it'll be my car. Fight duration, execute-range duration, what do you mean "best gear" (does it include ring enchants, then dropping enchanting for LW/JC?), group setup, pushback (frequency and timing), timing/staggering of buffs (inc. party's drums and possibly Power Infusion if you want to be -that- perfectionist), consumables, debuffs on boss... The list can go on and on, ultimately making the question pointless. What gets me wondering is "who cares?". In a scenario which is utopian and impossible, with gear which is unachievable for quite a while, with a setup that doesn't falter and a boss which is perfect with no motion/pushback... Who has the DPS advantage? Probably my car.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_729866"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Lets assume 2 things<br>
1: Fire damage is generally greater then Arcane damage<br>
2: A Fire spec mage brings more to a raid via debuffs (imp scorch) then an Arcane mage<br>
<br>
  Has anyone assessed the raid viability of bringing 1-2 Fire mage and 1 Arcane mage over just flat out Fire mages?<br>
<br>
  If I might digress to other classes in raids for a moment<br>
<br>
  If we might use Locks and Pallies for example. Pallies bring progressively more to a raid via blessings so you gain more benefit with additional pallies over the first, to a sticking point. Generally per class, you can have 2 beneficial blessings, 3 if one of the pallies has kings, past this point you reach diminishing returns, you loose out on AOE/HOT healing capacity over say another druid or priest over 4-5 pallies. Having the 3rd pally spec for Kings brings more to a raid then simply just bringing another healing Pally.<br>
<br>
  Looking at Warlocks, each Lock can put up a different curse that benefits the raid as a whole, again up to a point of diminishing returns. Once you reach a point of 3 curses, Warlock raid viability takes a drastic turn downwards. Now if a lock specs for 0/1/2 point health stones, each additional lock brings something unique to the raid, but you have say no 3 point HS, or any curse beyond the 3rd just starts to become no more then additional damage. Same with Pally/Kings, a 3rd pally with Kings brings more to a raid then a 3rd pally without kings, but past that you begin to get Melee blessings on casters and vice/versa.<br>
<br>
  This leads me to my starting point, if you had 3 mages, would 1 additional Arcane Mage bring more then 1 Additional fire mage. The questions being mainly thus<br>
<br>
1 : Can bringing 1 Arcane Mage to a raid be viable over say just bringing another Warlock or Hunter for damage if you have 2-3 Fire Mages already.<br>
2 : Can the DPS downturn of having one mage spec as Arcane, be made up for by scenarios/situations where the Arcane mage's benefits out way the lack of sustained DPS. If you say get a 5-10% loss on DPS, are there scenerios where the Arcane Mage can become more then 10% effective over a Fire Mage, thus counter balancing the lack of damage.<br>
<br>
  If we look at what a Mage brings for raids.<br>
Food / Water<br>
Arcane Int<br>
Decursing<br>
Scorch Debuff<br>
<br>
A few other things, however what can a second mage bring that the first can't bring.<br>
There is no need for another mage for AI or Water/Food<br>
Decursing potential goes up, but only so much decursing is needed for fights,<br>
initial stacking/reapplying the Debuff helps, Locks can Damage faster and only one mage needs stop DPS to apply, the other can just spam Fireball.<br>
<br>
Going on to a Third or Fourth Mage<br>
  If for decursing, you can just as well bring a druid for DPS / Decursing, or bring another lock/hunter/rogue if your shorter on those classes.<br>
  Needing 3 mages to keep scorch up just borders on being useless, needing 4 for the debuff borders on stupidity of the other 3 mages to either keep it up or re apply it (if it falls off all 3 mages should be trying to get it up).<br>
<br>
  So if one is going to bring a 3rd mage, I believe it can be argued on various fronts that 1 additional Arcane Mage comes out on top over a 3rd fire mage, in some cases perhaps 1 Fire and 1 Arcane comes out over 2 Fire mages.<br>
<br>
 if Arcane mage doesn't need to upgrade past tier 5 in certain slots, you leave tier 6 open for say the other fire mage/s. 1-2 Fire mage with 4-piece tier 6 adds more raid value then 3 mage with partial tier 6. Tier 6 head is more use to an arcane mage, most fire mages fight over Cowl Ilidari, I as an Arcane mage took the Tier 6 head which I most likley wont replace, any other number of mages in my guild would take it as a side grade, but ditch it for the Cowl. Going back to Even SSC, I favored the Boots off Lurker, most fire mages would rather the Boots of Blasting.<br>
<br>
  I have a whole slew of arguments over issues like Arcane needing to back peddle gear, the need of a shadow priest, distance factors and such. One might say bring it on?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_729888"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Okay, well, then with 1200 spell damage and 0% crit (which was just some numbers I used earlier to demonstrate that a warlock benefits much less from an spriest than an arcane mage.  Silly, but someone wanted me to demonstrate it), one can conclude that an arcane mage with the above stats receives 1.92 damage per mana he can receive.<br>
<br>
So, a new point arises: a Fel Mana Potion will give about 1300 more mana than a super mana pot, on average.  This costs you 25 spell damage for the rest of the fight.  So with the above stats, it would take over 200 seconds to lose damage for having gone with the Fel Mana potion<br>
<br>
As you gain more stats (notably crit, which I kept at 0% for this estimate), you will get more damage per mana, and the difference becomes even more clear.<br>
<br>
So, my overall point is: there is a point where arcane mages should be using Fel Mana Potions rather than Super Mana Potions, do we know what point this is?<br>
<br>
Edit:  Of course there is not a universal point for <i>all</i> arcane mages.  My question is more of a "are we aware that there is a point like that for every arcane mage, and do we have means to establish it quickly and easily for each individual?"<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>This is where you are wrong. The more warlock you stack, the more you increase the ISB uptime (since more warlocks means less impact from spriests eating ISB charges), as well as gain COD, which will outclass mage dps under most circumstances. Try to imagine that COD is a 8-9% personal dps increase buff that warlocks use when they have 4+ in the raid, because thats what it is.<br>

</div>No that it matters, but generally speaking theres no incentive to bring more than 1 mage per raid as far as raid synergy is concerned, and even then I don't consider imp. scorch a synergistic raid debuff - it is mostly a mage-only buff, or rather, its a personal uptime cost you need to keep up to compete, much like COS is to warlocks. Theres fire destro locks, but I will assume for simplicitys sake that they don't exist and/or are not commonplace. For the most part you want mages almost exclusively to make trash mobs easier thanks to polymorph; ie: sunwell. Thats about the only realistic reason to bring more than 1 mage per raid. Trash. We provide a somewhat stable dps and relative ease of flexibility (ie: our spells are well suited to adapt to many scenarios), but we don't particularly excell anywhere that notably matters for bosses. Ok, I admit, mages are very very good for felmyst, but that is arguably the one exception case of all bosses since TBC came out. That is approximately the only place I can think of where you specifically want mages over other classes.<br>
<br>
As far as fire mages are concerned it is a lot more convenient to have 2+ fire mages to ensure scorch is always up/faster scorch stacking, which mostly applies for trash.<br>

</div>Pure philosophical question. You either favor consistency, or you allow some leniancy in the results. I believe the core strenght of mages is consistency of results thanks to our arsenal of spells that suits pretty much any given task, and to that respect, I prefer fire spec since it goes in line with that mentality. Now if you want to point out that spec x excells at y, well then I reply that yes all specs have upsides and downsides. Do you want to go for the spec that tends to do more mediocre results overall but under a few fights it will do better, or you prefer to go for the spec that will give consistent results but never excel on any fight ? Or maybe you want to respec differently for every fight? Or maybe the fights you consider worthwhile are limited to 4-5 total which makes one spec seem better than the rest ?<br>
<br>
I don't think I can answer that. I can give you facts. I can give you TC. But in the end you make the judgement call and go with your own pick.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
addendum<br>
<br>
Arcane viability isn't really gaugeable. The results will vary highly depending on group composition. Same for fire spec. Here is a loose list of what matters, again, this is a matter of personal opinion more than anything else:<br>
<br>
if you want to compete as arcane, you want:<br>
-jow<br>
-resto shaman (over elemental shaman specifically)<br>
-shadow priest<br>
(innervates are a bonus and can compensate for lack of jow/mana tide)<br>
<br>
if you want to compete as fire, you want:<br>
-coe<br>
<br>
If you get moonkin or ret pally 3% more crit, it favors more fire spec because of 210% vs 175% crit scaling, but both spec somewhat make a decent use out of them. Firespec doesn't really gives much of a damn about jow, or a resto shaman - as long as you get your 101dmg totem. Of course, elemental shaman preferred, since again, it is better for fire spec due to crit scaling (and possible gear swap for less hit). Firespec is fine without a shadow priest on 4min- fights (or longer - depends on your haste rating), but past that point you pretty much want one. Arcane spec needs a shadow priest irregardless of fight under realistic scenarios. Also, drums favor firespec, so if you run with a lot of drums I would recommend to err towards firespec.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The tremendous amount of decursing during fights like Hyjal trash/ Achimode is one of the essentials of bringing mages, to limit it to issues like "well mages make trash easy cause of poly and that's it" really over simplifies things. When you get into issues like mana cost for sheeping / decursing, arcane mages come out a bit better then they were. <br>
<br>
For example, if a fight has a mage at 50% up time do to moving/decursing, then a fire mages Scorch goes from 10% of his damage to 15-20% of his damage, where as an arcane mage stays at 90-100% damage via AB. Which is odd cause most people argue why Arcane fails on boss fights the require a bunch of moving.<br>

</div>Alright lets go with some anti-arcane arguments I have heard.<br>
<br>
"Arcane has to downgrade gear to remain viable"<br>
Your basicly arguing that an Arcane mage has to give up 1-2% DPS to get 18-20% more damage as being a downside. If Tier5 gave 20% increase to Fireball damage how could you argue it as a downgrade? I would regulalry see Tier 3 Rogues/Warrios/Shamans walk around with Hand of Justice, a blue drop from a POS instance off a POS boss, would you have argued that downgrading to pre-raid gear some how gimped a rogue when said trinket was generaly regarded as the best melee trinket in the game?<br>
<br>
"AB ramping is bugged"<br>
Rolling ignites aint? If you use AB only for dumping your mana pool and then between Frost Bolts the ramping become negligable if you don't let the debuff.<br>
<br>
"Anything that Arcane can scale with such as +damage +crit, Fire scales with better"<br>
PURE DAMAGE yes fire scales better, but with a Shadow Priest one could try and argue that Arcane scales better with mana regen then fire does.  A fire mage can use destro pots or flame caps, but then you have to do the math over if AB dumping a mana pool &gt; flame caping/destro pots.<br>
<br>
<br>
"Arcane doesn't have range and an extra 10 Yards makes a hug difference"<br>
Congratulations you just made the argument why not to bring melee which stand RIGHT ON TOP of the boss, or that healers have to stand in range to heal the tank. People argue how range favors fire (which it does), but a converse to that would be fights which require you to stand close to the boss would favor arcane, or at least that Fire looses one of its benafits over arcane.<br>

If for an arcane mage a SP might mean a 5-10% increase in DPS were as for other classes could actually have -gasp- trouble unloading there mana bar which a SP. Yes I know arcane vary greatly depending on raid makeup, but for the 1 in 5 fights that favor an arcane mage, can Arcane actually make up for his lack on the other 5 fights is my main point, and that you only need one arcane mage for said purposes.<br>

</div>Funny how people talk about how fire scales better do to crit but not how arcane favors spirit/int. If you get optimal gear sure you can make that argument, but using my tier 6 example I can get my best head piece From Hyjal, with less competation and less viability to junk it, a fire mage has to wait till Illidan to get his best head piece outside Sunwell. I am more then happy to aknowladge that an Arcane mage is gear/raid dependant, but conversely can't one argue that under optimal scenario an arcane mage might actually do better?<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I personally raid as Arcane/frost, gathering up gear to go Fire versus Brutallus, as all my models hint at an increasing superiority of fire as ilvl 156 gear steps into the game, making 2 pieces of T5 obsolete.<br>
However, with the recent changes in mana regeneration mechanics, and talking to our resto druids, i've found out Innervate is not as important to healers as it was pre-2.4.<br>
<br>
I therefore asked one of our druids to put Innervate on me during bossfights where he doesn't need it, with a result of a net increase in my dps, allowed mainly by the fact i can spam AB during all cooldowns, opposed to the ability of doing it only for the first AP/IV use or so.<br>
By having 2 innervates this became even more clear, as i hardly had to use any frostbolt during these fights.<br>
<br>
Even though anedoctal evidences are not something i've ever trusted, this made a question arise: is it possible, and how many innervates are needed for an arcane/frost spec to deal more DPS than a fire one - given the best gear available?</div>

</div>I think if you have just one innervate, with the correct gear setup catered to arcane and assuming you are in a SP group, you will already be able to spam AB the whole fight for most BT and Mt Hyjal fights. Most BT/ Mt Hyjal fights are relatively short. In practise, even without innervates, AB makes up over 90% of my damage in most of my raid boss fights.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_729949"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Aldor, you grossly inflate fact. "we had a debuff issue with warlocks" you say. As though a firemage has fewer debuffs? Or indeed an arcane one. <br>
<br>
Fights with agro-reset and constant phase change, as well as fights ala-morogrim as you put it, are only in T5 content. You assume Morogrim works with a Nova rotation, I assure you it works perfectly without one, in fact it works better with SoC instead of AE and no Nova whatsoever.<br>
<br>
"a large portion of boss fights spawn trash mid fight". Do they? Like who exactly, past T5 content? Because if we're discussing T5 content we're in a totally different realm of TC. Illidan is so technical we're practically mandatory and aside from him there's nobody who summons anything, except Anetheron where our mage-specific tools are irrelevant. Indeed, low HP-pools are the biggest problem we face at him. <br>
<br>
Your 1-2% arguments are also indicative of someone who missinterprets TC. You see the T5 bonus and assume "zomg 20%" and feel it's idiotic to compare losing 2-3% gear for such a bonus, without realizing that without it AB was about as useful as an autistic ballet dancer. We are in fact comparing two specs who'se difference is measured in much less than 7%, and I'm sorry if that's a disappointment to you but wearing T5, which is two tiers below sunwell, -is- a damn big deal. And it's compounded by the itemisation wasted with surplus hit, though granted, you could conversely say spirit is wasted on Fire, even though less item budget is spent on it.<br>
<br>
The ignite bug is utterly negligible to normal Fire playstyle. Unless you bugger an ignite with an immediate blast on the move after a ball that will crit when it hits, you see exactly 0 loss from Ignite. While AB ramp is a much more serious DPS loss. Every time you move, get silenced, have to break the cycle, evocate or whatever else, you drop 9 seconds of crap DPS. At this level of TC that's the difference between wipe-the-floor and get-blown-away.<br>
<br>
You adress the 30y range issue of arcane, yet you don't in fact offer a solution for it. Melee DPS is not the same as ranged, you do not work in the same way and I assure you, DPS time is LOST due to 30y range. Melee do not swap targets in multi-target bosses, they do not need to stop DPS to move when they can rotate to another quadrant of the bosse's hitbox and are alltogether apples-and-oranges. Your arrogance against the 30y issue belies the fact that it is a genuine problem for arcane and so is it's lack of interrupt resist. And no, fights where you're close do -not- favor arcane. They simply don't cost it more walking time when relocating. In fact, I could argue close fights favor fire , as a close fight will allow Fblast on the move, which will be signifficantly better for a fire spec.<br>
<br>
Ultimately, I don't get what your point is. You seem to throw around a lot of "one can argue that" as fact, with no discernible goal. We know arcane is viable, we know arcane is more conditional and we know the pros and cons of arcane vs fire. You have said nothing that has not been said before, you've just been more assertive with your personal tint that arcane is somehow a superior choice once the raid has two firemages (I still can't figure out why).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_729998"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Interestingly, we had two points raised at the same time that are related:<br>
Sometimes there is a spare innervate floating around.<br>
Sometimes your group composition is such that one mage gets an spriest/other buffs he needs.<br>
<br>
In these cases, give the arcane mage the innervate, have your fire mages spec fire.  But this is so specific I don't think it's really relevant to TC, but yes, there are *some* situations where it's going to be better to have 1 arcane/2 fire.  Of course, just kick the arcane mage and get a second spriest? :P<br>
<br>
Edit: I should note that my guild runs with arcane mages, and since we're just starting Hyjal, I think arcane works very well (since we're in t5 anyway).  So it's useful in my situation, but that doesn't make it relevant TC for "optimal gear" (though of course, the quesiton should be raised).<br>
<br>
Edit2:  I guess I should summarize my point as: the ideal setup is either 3 arcane mages, or 3 fire mages.  This will sometimes be false under very odd group circumstances (1 floating innervate, maybe?)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_730021"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Neither arcane or fire mages are "needed" or required outside of one in any Mt Hyjal or BT content. None of the fights are DPS fights outside of ROS and Akama stage 2. Arcane shines in both.<br>
<br>
So, unless you are looking to top damage meters, then both specs are competitive and viable in both Mt Hyjal and BT.  Now, if you are talking about progressing through Mt Hyjal and BT.  Then its a different story. I would say from personal experience that progressing through these dungeons with arcane is easier than as fire. Because for the figths where DPS does matter, like ROS, arcane shines. <br>
<br>
For execution fights, it doesn't matter either way. Both specs are competitive.<br>
<br>
For boss fights were we are required, like Illidan, and as mage tank on council. Then arcane is better than fire. Fire DPS is crappy on the fires of Azzinoth in Illidan phase 2. And the mage tank should preferably have hit maxed out. Which is easier for arcane to do even while loading up on arena and stamina heavy gear. <br>
<br>
For AOE, arcane is generally at the top. So when progressing through Mt Hyjal, Arcane spec is very useful on trash waves. And trash waves are 50% of the progression in Mt Hyjal. <br>
<br>
Fire starts to surpass arcane on damage meters on selected fights only when they start getting four piece T6. Which is when you probably have both dungeons on farm. So, for practical purposes, both specs are viable, but I find that arcane is more flexible and helps more when your raid is progressing through BT/ Mt Hyjal.<br>
<br>
So, sure, when you have everything on farm and you are trying to gun for highest possible DPS based on TC and top gear. Then fire will come out better in some fights. But even then, not all. And if you want TC, then arcane mages with the luxury of SP, shammy, plus innervates all thrown in that can spam AB 100% of the fight will perform just as well as fire mages quaffing down destruction pots and using drums. <br>
<br>
Even based on my not top of the line gear (only got 2pc T5 and two pc T6), my theoratical DPS based on arcane blast spam on Rawr is around 1970 DPS. This is without throwing in arcane power, hasting and such. I would need to have 4 piece T6 and have drums plus destruction pots to top that as fire.<br>
<br>
There's a difference between theoratical top DPS once you have all the gear you ever want versus what is good when progressing through content and based on your existing gear. Rawr is very good for that, and with two piece T5, arcane spec remains very viable right up to when Illidan is on farm and beyond.<br>
<br>
These days, maximum DPS is dependent on too many raid specific conditions. based on Rawr, arcane mages outfitted with 4 pc T6 and 2pc T5 and the best gear, with shammy and SP in group, and raid buffs can achieve 2426 DPS just via spamming arcabe blast. Which means if they are allowed to throw in arcane power, get hasted via heroism/bloostlust or drums plus they can keep up spamming AB for 100% of the fight (maybe with the help of innervates being given). Then their theoratical DPS is huge. It will be even higher than 2426 DPS.<br>
<br>
I outfitted a fire mage using Rawr with best possible gear and fireball spam, even with scorch and COE, destruction pots up, gives only 2107 DPS. Fire would need to rely on that molten fury and drums from the entire raid to give higher DPS.<br>
<br>
Would fire be able to achieve that kind of DPS even with the best possible buffs and gear and raid support? Maybe , maybe not. Possibly if the entire raid is so stacked with drums of battle. Then yes. But otherwise, I think Fire would be hard pressed to give that type of DPS. Then again, how common is it to give druid innervates and ensure that arcane mages are paired with SP and Shammy at this stage?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Again I was generalizing, lets leave trash out for a moment. Bosses that need buffs to be spell stole Arcane comes out ahead, bosses that require heavy decursing Arcane come out ahead.<br>
<br>
ROS in BT prefer a mage to spell steal over a purge, Councel requires a mage tank.<br>
<br>
Hyjal, lets see 80% of the Trash and 100% of Achimode require decursing. Having a 1.5 second cast allows me to spam AB and decurse without a stoping as my only limiter is GCD. Fire mages spend half there time outside GCD when Fireballing, meaning I don't have to drop mid cast to decurse, a Firemage does.<br>
<br>
Bosses which need decursing Arcane has a bigger mana pool/mana regen capacity out side of Damage.<br>
<br>
In such was one of my points, for said encounter having just one arcane mage deal with a lot of side crap frees up a lot of space for DPS / Healing to go free, and often times you would only need one arcane mage for said tasks. Spending 2000-4000 mana on blinking/decursing/manashield/fire warding is a large chunk of a 10k mana pool but it is rather negligable for a 15k+ mana pool and a 12-14k Evocate.<br>

Arcane can socket Int/Damage with equal viabilaty and Spirit a close thrid, when a fire mages often have to skip their socket bonuses just to keep it damage.

You have said nothing that has not been said before, you've just been more assertive with your personal tint that arcane is somehow a superior choice once the raid has two firemages (I still can't figure out why).

</div>Tier 6 content where one arcane mage comes in handy<br>
<br>
RoS Arcane can spellsteal, and AB/IV a full mana bar. Spellstealing is preffered to purging. Only one arcane mage is needed for this.<br>
<br>
Counsel, Mage Tank, only one Arcane mage is needed.<br>
<br>
Mother ShaZ often become vulnurable to specific trees including arcane. Within a 10-15 second window and Arcane Mage can easily squeeze the full benafit out of this, Given that arcane mages are hybrid build they can do more DPS on two different debuffs, a Fire mage is gimped when fire Resist is up and has no viable option to change has damage type.<br>
<br>
For Hyjal Trash an Arcane mage makes for better AOE packs. Burning down trash before the next wave generaly 1 arcane mage can go a long ways. IF so you can theoreticly have the Arcane mage start on AOE sooner and leave a fire mage to single target and come out ahead.<br>
<br>
I could point to Fire Totems in SSC, but lets take a more recent instance. Hyjal infernal spawns on a boss (Forget which one.) Burning the infernals is more imperative then actually burning the boss. Boss fights allot 5-10 minutes, burn phases often allot you only seconds. My argument is having an Arcane mage for this one fight helping out more then it is gimping you in the other 4 HYJAL bosses. The ability to ramp up DPS for a burn portion IMO can make up for the lack of damage needed on another boss. However you only need one arcane mage to assist in the burning portion.<br>
<br>
What about lack of gear competition vs locks and other mages. Having perfectly good loot get chucked/DE doesn't benafit the raid.<br>
<br>
What about scorch becoming a larger % of a mages damage on fights that require a mage to often stop DPS to move or do various other tasks.<br>
<br>
What about socketing? Fire Mages loose a lot socketing yellow/blue, Arcane mages come out just peachy. Choatic Skyfire requires 2 blues.<br>
<br>
Keeping the AB buff up is a pain in the ass I will admit, but if I don't let it drop I can keep my AB up during bouts of moving or stop casting. Also IV/Coldsnap on pull negates issue with AB ramp up, and PoM can negate it for evocating and saving it for times when you do drop it. Assuming I drop it once per minute, 1 PoM every 3 minutes while not making up for the loss, certainly makes it less painfull.<br>
<br>
All in all I have no problem admitting that<br>
1: Arcane is the most gear Dependant spec (They have to have the proper trinkets and tier 5 set peices)<br>
2: Given general  conditions, fire is better.<br>
<br>
 I would stess the "general" conditions. One would say "you can't argue optimal for arcane cause several fighst are not optimal", I would counter argue "How many boss fights have -general- conditions."<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I think you need to rerun your Rawr cause you are doing something wrong.<br>
<br>
I'm specced 40/0/21 and I really like the spec but even I admit that when all of SWP is on farm Fire will Beat Arc/Frost just because of Arc/Frost's reliance on 2 pieces of T5 gear.  Once a Fire mage gets access to all the offset pieces they will beat the Arc/Frost mage.<br>
<br>
Sticking to only non-crafter only gear (BoE crafted being ok) and no ring enchants.<br>
<br>
Best in Slot for Arc/Frost worked out to:<br>
<br>
4T6 - bracers, belt, boots, chest<br>
2T5 - Shoulders and Gloves<br>
Helm of Arc Purity<br>
Leggings of Calamity<br>
Loop of Forged Power<br>
Band of Eternal Sage<br>
Wand of Demonsoul<br>
Council Cloak<br>
Serpent Coil Braid<br>
Hex Head<br>
Amulet of Unfettered Magics<br>
Grand Magisters Staff of Torrents<br>
<br>
With that gear on a 360 second Brutallus fight with a 400mp5 Shadowpriest, Elemental Shaman, using Elixirs and Brilliant Oils and all buffs I'm showing 2421dps.  That's also without using AB cycles (since interruption will cause the debuff to be lost and cost you too much dps to be reliably used) and with gemming to make sure the Meta gem will be activated.<br>
<br>
<br>
Best in Slot for 2/48/11<br>
4T6 - Helm, Bracers, Belt, and Boots<br>
Amulet of Unfettered Magic<br>
Council Cloak<br>
Robes of Ghostly Hatred<br>
Amice of the Convoker<br>
Gloves of Tyri's Power<br>
Leggings of Calamity<br>
2x Ring of Ancient Knowledge<br>
Hex Head<br>
Skull<br>
Wand of Demonsoul<br>
Grand Magisters Staff of Torrents<br>
<br>
With that gear and using a Flask of Death, the same group, and same buffs the Fire mage outputs 2549dps over that same 6 minute fight.<br>
<br>
When my guild gets to the point where I have those 4 pieces of offset loot I'll spec back to Fire but that moment is a long way aways so until we get to that point, in my mind, both specs are equally viable depending on the specific encounter.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I disagree with the tone of that statement.<br>
<br>
At equal gear levels up to the point where both specs can have 2 pieces of offset SWP loot (pants, chest, helm, shoulders or gloves) they are each capable of a similar level of performance.  Arcane also has the capability to do better on Felmyst and Kalecgoes.  Arcane also comes with 2 Ice Blocks for Twins while Fire has to lose the AE threat reduction (which is useful on Felmyst) for them, although that stealable fire buff in the Twins encounter is definitely a nod in Fire's favor for that fight.<br>
<br>
Fire also suffers a bit more from RNG syndrome, Arc/Frost just due to the increased number of casts over the same period of time, is more likely to give you more normalized dps numbers while Fire will vary significantly more depending on whether the RNG liked you that night or not.<br>
<br>
<br>
I'm sure this argument will continue indefinitely but I will point out that top 3 dps on tonights Brutallus was 2 mages following our warglaived rogue.  One of those mages was Arc/Frost and the other was 2/48/11.  I won't tell you which mage was higher because honestly the spread of damage between us was too close to say with any level of certainty that it was due to spec or gear or just luck.  Arc/Frost is definitely viable when it gets proper support and from what I've seen it's performance is sufficient to justify that level of support.<br>
<br>
<br>
On less of a TC note, Felmyst was kind tonight and I hit 8/8 T6 to go along with my 3/5 T5.  Time to start playing with Rawr.mage again to figure out if it changes any other aspect of my raiding set besides just those boots.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I have always wondered, AB ramped up is 1.5 seconds. Assuming a pushback can push back 1 second, one full pushback would only occur at 1.-1.499 seconds cast. If the pushback only happened at 0.5 seconds into the cast, you only lose 0.5 off a spellcast, if it happens 0.2 seconds into a cast you loose less. Longer spell casts give you a greater deal of time for the actualy pushback to happen. Not as good as 70% resist on fire I addmit, but still something I have noticed on bosses with pushback, or when I was Fire, Pyro vs Fireball, Pyro always would have more pushback then 2 fireballs simply cause it was a longer cast, 2 Fireballs would come out with 2.0 seconds of casting time to avoid a full pushback. Anyone done the math for this as a % of spell pushback?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Our shadowpriest does 400 mp5 on Brutallus, that's exactly the amount of mana he returned over our first kill broken down by the fight duration.  He probably does more now since he has gotten several very nice gear upgrades but I went with 400mp5 to be more realistic (not every guild has a shadowpriest as good as ours).  <br>
<br>
As for the meteor strike interruption, I set the interrupt level for Rawr at 5%.  There are 3 interrupts that occur while soaking and they come at 12 second intervals followed by 36 seconds of no interruption and then the next set.  Work that out and you get 4.17% interruption due to meteor strikes, I went with 5% to account for more realistic conditions.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I outfitted a fire mage using Rawr with best possible gear and fireball spam, even with scorch and COE, destruction pots up, gives only 2107 DPS. Fire would need to rely on that molten fury and drums from the entire raid to give higher DPS.<br>

Would fire be able to achieve that kind of DPS even with the best possible buffs and gear and raid support? Maybe , maybe not. Possibly if the entire raid is so stacked with drums of battle. Then yes. But otherwise, I think Fire would be hard pressed to give that type of DPS. Then again, how common is it to give druid innervates and ensure that arcane mages are paired with SP and Shammy at this stage?</div>

</div>Your original point was about arcane mage being more worthwhile than an extra warlock once you already have 3 warlocks in the raid. If you would be so kind to compare the dps output of a destro warlock that can use COD vs any mage spec, you might be severely deceived by the numbers. Oh also, for bonus points, on brutallus warlocks can summon and enslave an infernal for an extra 200 dps for 4:30-5:00. <br>
<br>
Now I don't know where you want to get at. My point was that nobody can say which spec is better simply because everything is situational. You can have a shot and try to list me 200 different points where arcane is better than fire, and I can also counter with an equally boring list that really gets us nowhere. If you want to make an argument, please stick to only a few strong points, not a quabble over bits and nibbles - all it does is dilute your overall stance. Quite honestly I can't even believe you brought up the fact that 4 destro lock is bad because of debuff issues - I think its patently absurd, but oh well. We can debate for days and days on end - I can assure you I can argue it both ways, and it will never end. In the end, nobody will agree on anything precisely because<br>
<br>
1- specs can't be compared because there are intangibles in plays, which we cannot quantify (ie: every boss/strategy will be different, time spent dpsing, number of interruption, distance to boss, possibility of being out of range of totems, etc.)<br>
<br>
2- even if specs could be compared, the numbers would vary from fight to fight because every fight will naturally cater to x or y spec. We would never agree on which fight should be used for comparison.<br>
<br>
In the end, it comes back to what I said originally. I can give you facts. I can give you TC. I can give you also a bunch of parses. In the end, you make the judgement call and spec what you prefer. <br>
<br>
If you just want to really argue that arcane is better than fire for an infinity amount of reasons (although I am not even certain if you are pro arcane or not, or just very argumentative), unless you think you can bring something truly new and enlightening I'd prefer see the subject be dropped. We're not really going anywhere. I haven't said once arcane was not viable, I think 2.4 made it back in line as a real competing spec, and yes like fire it has some peculiarities that are worth discussing. If you want to argue that bringing a mage over a warlock in a case of 3 warlocks and x mages, then go for it. But that has nothing to do with fire vs arcane.<br>

</div>I don't see why 'fights that require you to spellsteal' and 'fights with decursing' make arcane come out ahead. I know you're talking about the 3% arcane hit, but lets be honest here - that argument is BS. And I don't see how in gods name arcane is better suited at decursing than other specs. I know you have archimonde in mind, but should you think for a second, you realise that there is no reason to immediately stop your fireball to decurse now. If all 3 (for example) firemages just decurse when theyre out of fireball casting - hey, that gives on averages a decurse available every second, which is less than the time it takes for it to tick. And even if it ticked, one tick won't kill a player. And even if one tick could kill a player, then nothing stops a fire mage from fireballing right after a decurse, then switch to scorch/fireblasts as the decurse timer is back on.<br>
<br>
In any case, decursing for the most part is not a mage-specific task.<br>

Spending 2000-4000 mana on blinking/decursing/manashield/fire warding is a large chunk of a 10k mana pool but it is rather negligable for a 15k+ mana pool and a 12-14k Evocate.</div>

</div>If at any point in time you cast mana shield or fireward at a time where you could be casting a dps spell, you're being sub-optimal. This is the same thing as your frostnova/morogrim example. Its bad examples. If you really want to make the argument that arcane is superior specifically because it is 'less' affected by the mana cost of blink/decurse/manashield/whatnot, then not only you can - seriously - try harder, but you will notice one day that a fire mage can use his full dps rotation 100% of the time without mana issues. It doesn't matter how many lbink or spellsteal I need to do; I won't go oom. All you did was pointing out was that the more you need to use their abilities as arcane spec, the more it hampers your abilities to dps.<br>

</div>Not many. I did not point out that. But should you want to know, vashj favors firespec for killing striders - you never need to move at all.

Any mana used outside of damage doesn't hurt an arcane mage as much do to larger mana pool and mana regen capacity. Any fight that requires decursing/blinking/mana sheilding/fireward all factor into mana cost issues based on mana pool and regen capacity</div>

</div>What is your point? You can also plan ahead and move before that happens in some case. In other cases you don't need to immediately move - you can safely finish your cast. Decursing on archimonde is a good example. If you need to move, then fire wins with fireblast - it has better options for 'on the move' dps. I'm sure you'll point out soon how awesome POM-frostbolt is on the move because you haven't mentioned it yet.<br>
<br>
Again, any talk of mana regen and attempting to compare arcane spec to fire spec is to your disadvantage. Sure that means more AB time since you get to regen mana whereas firespec doesn't 'gain' from it - but firespec also doesn't needs extraneous mana. As I pointed out at the start of my post you will never find a case where we can compare firespec to arcane spec.<br>

My argument is having an Arcane mage for this one fight helping out more then it is gimping you in the other 4 HYJAL bosses.

We will never agree because arcane wins in some cases, and loses in somes. Same for fire. In the end, we have a bunch of 'pros' and 'cons' for both specs, too many of them to make any sense out of it. Not to mention that all of the pro and cons are non quantitative, so we have to resort to qualitatively argue our points - which is why this is not TC.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<!-- message -->
		<div id="post_message_730205"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Ok I'm getting a bit tired of this Fire vs Arcane debate so I'll bring something else up that I was just reminded of reading this.<br>
<br>
I often see a point being brought up about how it is the end of the world if you lose the AB debuff. The argument usually being that you lost a lot of time and dps by having to reramp it. What noone takes into account is that arcane is very good at making up for lost dps. Yes by reramping you lose dps, but at the same time the ramp up is a lot more efficient and it buys you mana to do more dps later. So in context of arcane saying losing the debuff is bad just because it has lower dps is not good enough.<br>
<br>
Now for the usual Arcane/Frost not dropping debuff is probably optimum, depending on exact conditions, but still the loss is not as big as people make it sound. What was more interesting to me is what I found out last week when I tried something in Rawr. For deep arcane the optimum choice is ABAMx3+FrB cycle. We will all agree that overlapping the debuff is not 100% and can fail because of pushbacks. So what I wanted to see is what the cost is of having the debuff drop to make a better estimation of what option is better taking this uncertainty into account.<br>
<br>
When talking about what is better to use for arcane we've established in the 2.3 thread that one has to look at the dpm tradeoff against AB, the lower dpm tradeoff meaning a better conversion. With my gear I get 2.99 dpm tradeoff for ABAMx3+FrB (ABAM3FrBCC in Rawr). The cycle that many are suggesting and also used in magegraf is alternating AB and AM (ABAM in Rawr). This cycle has a tradeoff of 3.3 dpm, a better alternative with AM on clearcast and ramping with AB-AM (ABAM3CC) has a tradeoff of 3.17 dpm. Now the interesting thing I found is this. If I adjust the ABAMx3+FrB cycle to not overlap the AB and make it always start from full duration it has a tradeoff of 3.11 dpm. So while obviously not utilizing the debuff is not reasonable, even if you lost it each time the dpm conversion is still better than other alternatives.<br>
<br>
So while for Arcane/Frost using cycles is not as benefitial (specially because you don't get the OO5SR effects you get with AM), when you do lose the debuff it's not as bad as it looks like.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I have a problem at the moment, not so much with the theory on my - admittedly, very easy to calculate/play fire spec - but with an optimal gear setup for it. I've toyed around with various spreadsheets, and stumbled on the following from Rounced on the previous page of this thread (which is the same as my list) - I'd just like to know what everyones planning to do gear-wise. Remember there's also a dagger announced from either M'uru and Kiljaeden, albeit it's obviously still unconfirmed! <br>

</div>Your assumptions are fire-friendly.<br>
<br>
1) Try it with a resto shaman instead of an elemental shaman, which is more optimal for an arcane mage. Or compare elemental with a fire mage to resto with an arcane mage.<br>
<br>
2) Arcane mages can benefit greatly from an innervate. Now, the ability to *get* an innervate is situational, but don't be shocked if it isn't even being used, or is being used inefficiently (saving the druid 1.5g on a mana pot) on many fights you are currently in (I have seen mages embarassed by making the argument that innervate is better for a healer when the innervate is being wasted on the parses the mage uses to point to the superiority of their pet spec). I would agree that it isn't safe to assume an innervate, but it should be recognized that if an arcane mage can get one their dps goes through the roof, and that the innervate to the arcane mage can situationally be in the best interests of the raid.<br>
<br>
3) If you can eliminate fire mages, locks can drop COE and you get 1 more curse of doom. If you are viewing spec choice as a function of raid optimization rather than individual dps optimization (and you should be), this counts in favor of arcane.<br>
<br>
I agree on the limitations of arcane, and won't be getting into an arcane/fire p*****g contest. But I still don't think arcane's potential has been fully pushed yet. I think "viable but situational" is a fair description.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Its a minor point, but I have done arcane/frost on strider dps. It kicks ass.<br>
<br>
Yes, range is a pain in the ass, but:<br>
<br>
1) You have no threat problems whatsoever and can therefore start dps a lot earlier.<br>
<br>
2) Can easily work frostbolts into the AB rotation to keep a chill up, with minor dps loss. (Yes, you can argue that fire can do this too with a 2/48/11 spec, but then your range superiority argument goes out the window, as the fire mage has to stay in 30 yard range for frostbolts, just like the arcane mage does).<br>
<br>
3) Can easily tweak your frost tree to include permafrost and/or frostbite with no discernable loss in dps, while increasing the survivability of the kiters and reducing the need of other dps classes to reposition.<br>
<br>
4) You have the flexibility to work on the elemental adds if necessary, unlike a frost mage.<br>
<br>
5) Arcane mages have a lot of burst flexibility which is very nice on striders. Any fight where the damage needed is "bursty" benefits arcane as the bursty damage is spread over a smaller denominator of effective dps uptime.<br>
<br>
6) repositioning isn't *that* hard with blink and all the snares on the striders.<br>
<br>
7) There is a very good chance you will have 2t5 at this stage of your progression, and with that bonus and no T6 arcane dps has a major advantage on fire.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Alright lets go with some anti-arcane arguments I have heard.<br>
<br>
"Arcane has to downgrade gear to remain viable"<br>
"AB ramping is bugged"<br>
"Anything that Arcane can scale with such as +damage +crit, Fire scales with better"<br>
"Arcane doesn't have range and an extra 10 Yards makes a hug difference"</div>

</div>The trouble here is that we have a "straw man argument" -- the person you're quoting (manly, "I don't think I can answer that. I can give you facts. I can give you TC. But in the end you make the judgement call and go with your own pick.") doesn't actually say any of those things.  Normally a straw man argument is merely sloppy debate technique, since you're really responding to your own version of your opponent's argument rather than his.  However since you successively quote manly, the insert and reply to the these straw man arguments, then <i>continue to quote manly</i> and offer your responses, you create the deceitful impression that these are his words too.  Since you need your straw man to drag the debate back to a question of the absolute value of arcane versus fire (rather than the "judgement call" that formed the actual thesis you're replying to) it is even more distorting.<br>
<br>
I apologize if this comes off trolling but I consider it a fair rebuttal to a poorly supported argument.  I am also very uncomfortable with someone attributing false quotes to another and think it should be pointed out.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>On Leo I am far less concerned about topping the charts in terms of dps than I am in having all cooldowns and full mana bars up and ready to go when he hits 15%, as that is the only challenging part of the fight (Leo still wipes us occasionally as we use our SSC nights partially to gear up alts and backup raiders). Its annoying as hell to blow arcane power only for him to do his pinball impression in the opposite corner of the room.<br>
<br>
That said, I am usually in top 2 for dps on this fight even not trying to top the meters for the reasons you mention.

</div>If we're talking strider kiting, I actually find that its more efficient to have a 2/48/11 or something close to that for it. What I ended up doing was speccing for impact (10% chance to stun on fire spell hit) and then into permafrost as well. If you wanted to take it a step further (like my guild did) we had at least one mage spec for imp blizzard, netting 75% slow speed on the strider and then in between periodic rank 1 blizzard casts he would spam scorch for lots of impact hits.  <br>
<br>
Obviously this is not a thread focused on strategies for strider, Im just pointing out that there are other specs that are competitive or even better in terms of dealing with the striders, we could probably argue points either way but what it probably will come down to is the theme that Manly has mentioned before with regards to arcane vs fire. Its pretty much just going to be a matter of preference.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I too don't see much point in the great war of arcane vs fire - it really comes down to personal preference. I have a problem at the moment, not so much with the theory on my - admittedly, very easy to calculate/play fire spec - but with an optimal gear setup for it. I've toyed around with various spreadsheets, and stumbled on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080502171307/http://elitistjerks.com/730059-post244.html" target="_blank">following from Rounced</a> on the previous page of this thread (which is the same as my list) - I'd just like to know what everyones planning to do gear-wise. Remember there's also a dagger announced from either M'uru and Kiljaeden, albeit it's obviously still unconfirmed!</div>

</div>If we're talking about optimal gear for 2/48/11 (based on the gear discovered so far in 2.4, anyway), I'd avoid building a set around the Grand Magister's staff. It has so much spell hit by itself that the spell hit on otherwise optimal gear choices (<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34362" target="_blank">[Loop of Forged Power]</a>, <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33497" target="_blank">[Mana Attuned Band]</a>, etc.) goes to waste. Plugging stats for a mage with optimal Hyjal/BT gear (4T6, Illidari Cowl, Zhar'doom, Belt of Blasting, to note the particulars) and full raid buffs/consumables into Lhivera's calculator, we get:<br>
<br>
1 spell hit = 1.51 damage<br>
1 spell crit = 0.81 damage<br>
1 spell haste = 1.15 damage<br>
<br>
Of course, <i>stat equations are imperfect and change depending on gear</i>; it seemed sensible, therefore, to draw equations from an optimal pre-Sunwell gear set, so as to determine how best to utilize the new Sunwell gear. Applying these values to the staff (with 3x <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=35760" target="_blank">[Reckless Pyrestone]</a>), the equated damage value is 434.44. That's barely above the value of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080502171307/http://wow.curse.com/images/details/115338/" target="_blank">Sunflare</a>+<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34179" target="_blank">[Heart of the Pit]</a> (428.80), a combo which derives none of its DPS from spell hit. This suggests gear should be optimized through the 1H+OH combo, to avoid exceeding the spell hit cap (preserving the value of spell hit from other sources).<br>
<br>
Based on the set of all known 2.4 gear (which, it must be noted, <i>is subject to change based on future Sunwell gear discoveries</i>), I see the following as the optimal gear set:<br>
<br>
4T6 (Bracers, Belt, Boots, Gloves)<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080502171307/http://wow.curse.com/images/details/115338/" target="_blank">Sunflare</a> + <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34179" target="_blank">[Heart of the Pit]</a><br>

<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33829" target="_blank">[Hex Shrunken Head]</a><br>
<br>
Some explanation is in order:<br>
<br>
- With the exception of the T6 gloves and <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34179" target="_blank">[Heart of the Pit]</a>, the above are all best-in-slot choices, and the entire set offers 161 spell hit rating. Based on the stat equations, the Heart is slightly weaker than <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30872" target="_blank">[Chronicle of Dark Secrets]</a>, but the Chronicle would have placed the set at 178 spell hit rating, well above the cap. Comparing all "best-in-slot" items with spell hit rating to the top choices for those slots without spell hit suggests the Chronicle is the optimal piece to swap out (to avoid wasting spell hit). I'll exclude the T6 pieces, since those need to be balanced for the 4T6 bonus (and all but the gloves are best-in-slot items anyway).<br>
<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30872" target="_blank">[Chronicle of Dark Secrets]</a> (89.30) vs. <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34179" target="_blank">[Heart of the Pit]</a> (81.05) = 8.25 damage loss<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33497" target="_blank">[Mana Attuned Band]</a> (99.28) vs. <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32527" target="_blank">[Ring of Ancient Knowledge]</a> (79.65) = 19.63 loss<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32525" target="_blank">[Cowl of the Illidari High Lord]</a> (153.53) vs. <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34405" target="_blank">[Helm of Arcane Purity]</a> (130.98) = 22.55 loss<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34362" target="_blank">[Loop of Forged Power]</a> (104.19) vs. <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32527" target="_blank">[Ring of Ancient Knowledge]</a> (79.65) = 24.54 loss<br>
*<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34204" target="_blank">[Amulet of Unfettered Magics]</a> (102.70) vs. <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32589" target="_blank">[Hellfire-Encased Pendant]</a> (76.01) = 26.69 loss<br>
<br>
* Jewelcrafters may come out ahead by keeping the Chronicle and swapping in <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34359" target="_blank">[Pendant of Sunfire]</a> (101.50) for the Amulet, creating a set with 163 spell hit rating.<br>
<br>
- For 4T6, since the new Sunwell pieces (Bracers, Belt, Boots) are all best-in-slot items, choosing the fourth piece boils down to comparing the +damage value of the remaining T6 options to the corresponding non-T6 best-in-slot items. Using the Theorycraft-o-Matic equations again, the following suggests that (at least for now) the smallest sacrifice for the 4T6 bonus comes from choosing the T6 gloves:<br>
<br>
<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34406" target="_blank">[Gloves of Tyri's Power]</a> (127.12) vs. <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=31055" target="_blank">[Gloves of the Tempest]</a> (114.15) = 12.97 damage loss<br>

<br>
Once again, this could all change depending on future gear discoveries in Sunwell. But for now, this appears to be the optimal gear set for 2/48/11.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I have a slightly different priority on the order of upgrades, in terms of damage upgrade from the various pieces of Sunwell loot: <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34210" target="_blank">[Amice of the Convoker]</a> &gt; <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34364" target="_blank">[Sunfire Robe]</a> &gt; <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34181" target="_blank">[Leggings of Calamity]</a>, which might be explained by the fact that Sunfire Robe obviously is better than Ghostly Hatred - I'll double check this when I get home from work.

With this setup you have 165 Spellhit and you get 2211 DPS with a 250mp5 Shadowpriest, 2261 with a 250mp5 Shadowpriest, so my setup is a little behind yours, but 4 dps wont be noticable, its one crit more or less. I choose this setup because except the Robe you can get everything on the first 4 bosses, for Sunflare you will have to wait until KilJaden, which for my guild is a long long time away. Naturally if there is a Cloak Drop with Spellhit on it, you get serious problems because you are already capped, so this setup is more like what you can get for KilJaden and after you killed him, you can switch to Zephriels setup.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Depending on if you have the Skull and on which Sunwell pieces you have gotten so far the staff can be a sidegrade at best  to Tempest + Chronicle or Illidans staff. I personally have enough trouble already dropping hit for other stats when our elemental Shaman is in the raid.  <br>
<br>
Overall it feels like my DKP would be better spent on more meaningful upgrades while leaving the staff to others who might lack hit or a t6 level weapon.<br>

</div>Interesting idea.   I recall that you can swap out an int weapon after beginning an evocation to get more mana out of it, but does that work with casting as well as channeling?  Can you begin a cast with the haste weapon and quickly switch to a +dmg weapon before it finishes to benefit from both?  This of course would only work to increase DPS on the first cast since switching back to the haste weapon would activate the global cooldown between spells rather than during a spell.  If it works it could be an option for getting that extra little bit of DPS on fights where you need to move around a bit and so an extra global cooldown once in a while between fireball spam isn't that big of a deal.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

In order to get rolling ignites, you need to get your fireballs down to between 2.00-2.10 seconds.  A more detailed explanation of this is given in the rolling ignite thread.

With this setup, you will have <b>718 passive haste, which is equivalent to 45.73% increase to spell cast speed or a 2.059second fireball cast.</b>  At this haste level, you will presumably have enough to roll ignites.  The only downside with this gear setup is the lack of hit; you will only have 112 spell hit without trinkets.  Having an elemental shaman will be extremely beneficial.  Additionally, if you have multiple leather-workers in your party, you may be able to drop some spell haste in favor of hit.  The extra 80 spell haste from chaining drums of battle should provide you with extra margin.<br>

</div>Precisely what I'm saying.  Cast time is calculated at the initial cast, and the final damage of the spell is calculated on completion.  Having the haste dagger equipped when you begin the cast will reduce the cast time, swapping for a +dmg weapon before the cast is complete will increase its damage, double-dipping on weapons for one cast.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Actually it would work and potentially would be open to exploitation.<br>
<br>
Casting time is determined at the start of cast but damage is calculated at the completion (easily seen when a +damage trinket proc completes before the cast actually fires).<br>
<br>
So you would want to have the haste weapon equipped when you start the cast but then have a +damage weapon macroed into place during the cast.  Real issue is that if you swap weapons without being in the middle of a cast you become subject  to a GCD during combat which really would screw with your dps.  <br>
<br>
For a Fire build you could macro the haste weapon to be equipped when casting Scorch and the Damage weapon to be equipped when casting Fireball.  That way you would lose the +damage on Scorch which has a shittastic coefficient but gain the haste on the next Fireball you cast (along with the +damage from the weapon swap).<br>
<br>
Could do the same thing with Arc/Frost by having the haste one equipped on Arcane Blast and the damage one equipped on Frostbolt (since Frostbolt has a larger coefficient and would get a bigger boost from the additional haste).<br>
<br>
For both of them you would also have to make it so the macro would be able to use ctrl/shift/alt to stop the swap to the haste weapon for when you are planning on spamming Arcane Blast or for when you are stacking/restacking the scorch debuff.<br>
<br>

You're going from 292 damage 23 haste and 30 crit I think it was to 227 haste and 18 spell hit.  The loss in switching from 12 dmg crimson spinels to reckless pyrestones isn't too bad<br>

</div>You'll lose dmg on nearly every item from switching gems.  And I believe it would be more than 80DPS if you considered it against the sunflare(if this does exist).  You would have access to this weapon by the time you have your haste gear set.  <br>
<br>
Still, i may try to get it to see if the mechanic works as expected.<br>
<br>
Also...it's 227 haste on the dagger.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Precisely what I'm saying.  Cast time is calculated at the initial cast, and the final damage of the spell is calculated on completion.  Having the haste dagger equipped when you begin the cast will reduce the cast time, swapping for a +dmg weapon before the cast is complete will increase its damage, double-dipping on weapons for one cast.</div>

</div>Sorry, I read your post completely backwards. Yes it would work. In fact you could probably macro it such that it would alternate every other cast. So odd-numbered casts would be at full dmg with +227 haste, even numbered would be -250ish dmg. Hmm....as others have said you'd have to be rolling ignites to make that worth it past the first cast.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

4 pieces T6 (Belt, Bracers, Boots, Head)<br>
[Grand Magister's Staff of Torrents]<br>
[Wand of the Demonsoul]<br>
<br>
[Amulet of Unfettered Magics]<br>
[Amice of the Convoker]<br>
[Cloak of the Illidari Council]<br>
[Robes of Ghostly Hatred] (or [Sunfire Robe] for tailors)<br>
<br>
[Amulet of Unfettered Magics]<br>
[Leggings of Calamity]<br>
[Loop of Forged Power]<br>
[Mana Attuned Band]<br>
[The Skull of Gul'dan]<br>
[Hex Shrunken Head]<br>
<br>
With this setup you have 165 Spellhit and you get 2211 DPS with a 250mp5 Shadowpriest, 2261 with a 250mp5 Shadowpriest, so my setup is a little behind yours, but 4 dps wont be noticable, its one crit more or less. I choose this setup because except the Robe you can get everything on the first 4 bosses, for Sunflare you will have to wait until KilJaden, which for my guild is a long long time away. Naturally if there is a Cloak Drop with Spellhit on it, you get serious problems because you are already capped, so this setup is more like what you can get for KilJaden and after you killed him, you can switch to Zephriels setup.</div>

</div>Carnivean, I can definitely appreciate the merits of building a set with gear available earlier in Sunwell progression, but doesn't your listed set (including the helm enchant) come out to 183 spell hit? (I'm going to assume you meant to list <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34406" target="_blank">[Gloves of Tyri's Power]</a> instead of the Amulet twice.) There doesn't appear to be a way to shed some of that spell hit without taking at least one significant hit in gear quality (unless you're a jewelcrafter--<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34359" target="_blank">[Pendant of Sunfire]</a> would bring that number down to 168, and efficiently replace spell hit with other DPS stats).<br>
<br>
To be fair, I should add that if new "best-in-slot" gear choices without spell hit are discovered from the last two bosses in Sunwell, replacing spell hit gear currently on the list, that would change things in favor of <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34182" target="_blank">[Grand Magister's Staff of Torrents]</a>.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Head 13 + 1 4 (Enchant)<br>

Ring 19<br>
Trinket 25<br>

165 <br>
<br>
I know that the setup is a little inferior to yours, but my guild hasn't even killed Kalec and we will need a lot of time to progress through SWP, so I try to make the best of the gear avaible early in the instance, because we will kill Kalec a few times, before we kill Brut and Felmyst.. ..it is another way of progress than most guilds have here on this forum.<br>
<br>
Another important fact, why I favor my selection, is that the Staff can drop pretty early and so you KNOW if it drops or not before you choose a great deal of the other gear. <br>
If you optimize your gear towards Sunflare and your guild has bad drop luck (like we did on Archimonde, not a single Tempest in 6 months of farming him), than you have a serious problem, but if you try to get the Staff as soon as it drops, you can gear in both ways. <br>
But ultimately it's a choice of personal preference, in theory your setup is a bit better, but for me, to be able to pull my weight during the SWP progress raids, and the knowledge that you have your weapon until WotL (or atleast a Weapon that is good enough even if not the optimal choice for the expansion) is more important.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
The question I would pose is this:  Will icey veins be worth it as it breaks the "roll zone".  From a pure dps standpoint I guess it depends on what kind of group buffs you have.  More crit = higher consecutive crit streak chance (moonkin + ele shaman).  Apart from pure dps, 2s fireballs might get quite mana intensive depending on how good shadow priest scaling turns out - and if the dps gain (if there is one) from icey veins is trivial I might suggest clearcasting if you are having to mana pot with that much haste anyhow.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">The new haste weapons beg the question of trying to mix in more weapon swapping.  Any idea if the length of a combat weapon-swap global cooldown is affected by haste, such that you could put on a haste weapon with scorch/fireblast to give the haste bonus to the following fireball?  Or would it cause a full GCD that clips off whatever might be gained?</div>

Same here.  But I actually played around with it with a fire spec a bit more.  Rawr puts Sunfire Handwraps ahead *IF* there's no Imp DS -- but go activate Imp DS and suddenly Glove's of Tyri's Power pulls ahead provided your gear is similar to mine.  It has them that close together.  Of course, I tend to think that Rawr is either overvaluing crit or undervaluing haste -- that just doesn't seem right to me.  Sure Tyri's power has some wasted stats on spirit, but it has a higher ilvl to start with.  It's got quite a bit of haste to Sunfire's 0.  Regardless, Sunfire Handwraps are far easier to get (provided someone on your server can actaully make them, Blackrock *finally* had someone get the pattern only a week ago -- still no one can make any of the new rings).<br>
<br>
By the way, regarding Glitchy rolling ignite mechanics, I don't believe that still applies in 2.4.  There seems to be a small delay from the time you crit a mob to the time the ignite debuff is applied.  If your Fireballs are sub 2.0 seconds, you will NEVER get the first tick of ignite before your next Fireball hits no matter how far back you stand.  It's just not possible anymore.  You're fireballs need to be longer than 2.0 seconds, like around 2.5 seconds -- and I've tried many fireballs at that speed and still not seen any evidence of ignites rolling post 2.4.  Of course, I can't go test it now since I'm currently back on my frost spec.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_732551"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Somebody mentioned the prospect of weapon swapping and while on the topic of the permanent free ignites I thought I would bring this to the table:<br>
<br>
At 363 haste + icey veins = 2.03s fireball<br>
At 730 haste = 2.05s fireball<br>
<br>
Spellblade + heart of the pit + quick lionseye demonsoul = 227 + 32 + 28 = 287 Haste<br>
730-287 = 443 - still enough to hit the zone with icey veins up while swapping to non-haste weapons (tempest + chronicle + ?)<br>
<br>
At this point you could artificially create 2.05s fireballs (with a script / g15) while having a lot more spell damage.<br>
<br>
Edit:  Alternatively you could hit 730ish haste incorporating drums and simply click them off during veins which would put you at 363 haste without drums or any weapon / oh / wand haste (2.03s fireball with veins)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
CASTING RANGE<br>
While it is true Fire has 50% more range, it also has 100% longer casting time. If you have a fight like Supremous where the mob often moves away from you, the longer range does not negate the longer cast time. Yes you can fireblast, but so can an Arcane Mage, or a Frost Mage. Assuming the mobs moves 10 yards every 1.5 seconds an Arcane mage needs to be 20yards from mobs for a full cast, a fire mage would also need to be about 20 yards in order to finish a full Fireball before being out ranged.<br>
<br>
The only fight I have ever done in all of WoW where range was a big issue was Anubrekon in Naxx, which had a manditory 25-30 yard range, not even Prince in Kara has this. Mana/DPS/proper gear are necessity, range is more of a luxury, one that can certainly be worked around.<br>
<br>
CASTING TIME<br>
Arcane has way more leeway to finish a full cast before needing to do a stop cast do to moving mobs, reaction to boss AOE and such. Arcane spends all of it's time on GCD while Fire spends half casting outside GCD. I played Frost for years, having to stop mid cast to move/pot/mana shield does take it's toll on DPS, I have found AB allows me to finish a cast before I need to dodge an attack or react to something.<br>
<br>
DOES AB RAMP UP DESTROY ARCANE VIABILATY?<br>
Lets try some common sense here, and a it of math too. You do in fact loose DPS from ramping or the Debuff falling out, but do you come out net negative from it falling off? You loose DPS but you gain mana efficiency. Generally you AB your mana down and then Frostbolt/single AB your mana back up, loosing the Debuff early only forces you into this mana efficient state early. So the question do you loose out? No, you are going to loose full AB debuff at some point in time during a prolonged fight, all this does is change when the state occurs. <br>
<br>
NET LOSS = DAMAGE PER SECOND<br>
NET GAIN = DAMAGE PER MANA<br>
<br>
It is only a true 100% loss if you have nothing to gain from said loss.<br>
<br>
Compared to dropping a Fireball cast<br>
<br>
AB full cast no stack  = 2.5 seconds, of which you are only doing 60% potential damage<br>
3 casts for stack 2.5 * 3 = 7.5 seconds at 60% DPS<br>
<br>
The numbers aboves assumes worst case for all 3 casts for sake of argument. The ramp up time is actually less and the DPS progressively ramps up so the numbers are biased against Arcane.<br>
<br>
Loosing 3 seconds on Fireball casts due to stop casting on several occasions = 50% Damage over 6 seconds.<br>
<br>
7.5 seconds at 60% DPS Dropped AB to Ramp Up<br>
6.0 second 50% DPS from dropped Fireball casting.<br>
<br>
Arcane only looses out it's native DPS over Fireball's native DPS assuming the Fire Mage never needs to drop mid-cast, having played Frost myself for years, I assure you that I had to drop Frostbolt mid cast way more then Arcane Blast, mainly do to either global cool down restrictions or reaction time. I will drop AB if needed, but I am more likely to finish 0.5 second of what's left before reacting, where as with Frostbolt if I was 1.0 mid cast I'd have 1.5 seconds left on a cast which I could not afford to leave.<br>
<br>
On a side note if I loose an AB stack I only loose DPS, but still gain mana efficient cast, if you drop an Imp scorch you loose DPS and Mana efficiancy.<br>
<br>
<br>
SPELL PUSH BACK<br>
Spell pushback is affected by<br>
Talents/gear<br>
Frequency of push back<br>
Length of spell cast<br>
<br>
In a case like Zul,Aman on a boss, rapid push back destroys Arcane for a phase in a boss fight. In the case of taking hits from a 2 second spell cast, you will cast one full AB and 0.5 seconds into another cast before the push back occurs, like if I am getting hit from a caster or gargoyle in Hyjal. For AB this would be about a 33% pushback. A moot point but something I have noticed in Frostbolt vs AB.<br>
<br>
TIER 5/6 AND YOU<br>
Tier 5 Gave Arcane a buff that allowed it to be viable.<br>
Tier 6 took something that was as good or better then Tier 5 AB and made it better.<br>
Tier 7? People like to call it Tier 7, but it is just Tier 6 with better stats. When you get past set bonuses, Sunwell offers merely the same set bonus with better stats. A problem with AB was the need of a filler spell, Frostbolt. Sunwell allows AB to gain the Frostbolt 5% Bonus while keeping AB tier 5. In this Regard Sunwell upgrades AB spamming more then Fireball spaming. Fireball is getting added stats to it's allready established 5% bonus, AB is getting 5% to it's partner spell, which it never had pre-Sunwell. AB Gains a set Bonus, Fire just gains more damage.<br>
<br>
ARCANE HAS RECEIVED HIDDEN UPGRADES<br>
Did you know Arcane has gotten several upgrades? Sure Icy Veins and Spirit-Int Ratio, but what about the dozen or so other upgrades? Here are some to name a few.<br>
<br>
+6 damage/+4 spirit gems from Blood Furnace are no longer uniqe, these gems are the best blue gems for Arcane, being able to use several of them helps, especially considering things like Choatic gemming requirements. This is a small buff.<br>
<br>
Zul Aman, added the best Int staff in the game, for Evocation this is a small buff.<br>
<br>
Magister's Terrace added the best Spirit staff in the game, something you can use for innervates/eating, and pop on when you get silenced or go oom, this is a small buff.<br>
 <br>
One of the best Arcane wands was added to badge Vendors a few patches ago, 15 int / 18 damage + a blue socket (blue = good for Chaotic SD). This is a small buff.<br>
<br>
One of these in and of itself very marginal, but added together they make more then a marginal difference. While they also can benefit Fire to a lesser extent, they are far more help full tools for an Arcane Mage. For example I myself drink fully raid buffed about 2000 - 2100 MP5, an eating outfit helps, and that spirit staff makes a big part of it. I can hit 700-800 MP5 outside of 5SR when I do get silenced with a mear weapon swap. Most of this stuff is easily accessed and can be farmed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
HIT CAPPING ZOMG<br>
Is hit capping a big issue? Only if you let yourself hit cap. Going beyond 6% to hit via gear carries over to your off spell (Fireball or Frosbolt.) Second, you can actually drop points in Arcane Focus and put it into talents like Magic Absorbtion or Prismatic Cloak. 4% damage mitigation means I can actually dump PvP gear for instancing gear in a 10k HP. Fire doesn't have as many options for dumping a DPS talent for survivability. Arcane has ways it can go with too much hit, Fire can do nothing if with extra spirit you wind up with.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">1- specs can't be compared because there are intangibles in plays, which we cannot quantify (ie: every boss/strategy will be different, time spent dpsing, number of interruption, distance to boss, possibility of being out of range of totems, etc.)<br>
<br>
2- even if specs could be compared, the numbers would vary from fight to fight because every fight will naturally cater to x or y spec. We would never agree on which fight should be used for comparison.<br>
<br>
In the end, it comes back to what I said originally. I can give you facts. I can give you TC. I can give you also a bunch of parses. In the end, you make the judgement call and spec what you prefer. </div>

What you fail to realized is people gear up for Sunwell by doing tier5-6 content and the overwhelming majority of players carry loot over across instances, some even as far back as Kara. Given free rein on Sunwell loot is one thing, but in the realm of DKP, even if it's just one or two items per instance, I came out pretty well cause people did not want Serpent Coil, on odd runs back through old content people don't want tier5, Loosing out on seacaller slippers doesn't hurt me as much as someone who never got Blasting Boots, and still looses out. Of course there are badge boots now, but those didn't exist 3 months ago when I was using my boots. Same could be said for my wand I suppose. Some of my best gear comes from outside raids, such as 6dam/4spir gems over the purple gem drops inside 25 mans, freeing up gems for other raiders.<br>

</div>Even setting aside the larger health pool, mana pool (which is effectively extra regen for evocate/innvervate/tide), crit and damage, BoK will give you competitive regen with BoW for fairly achievable intellect/spirit values.<br>
<br>
To calculate this, take your raid-buffed (but pre-BoK) spirit and intellect totals and plug them into the following formula (shamelessly stolen from Constantius' thread):<br>
<br>
5 * 0.0093271 * Spirit * Square_root ( Intellect )<br>
<br>
Guesstimating your values at 600int, 350spi raid-buffed, sans blessings:<br>
<br>
Regen while casting = 0.6 * 400mp5 = 240 mp5<br>
Regen while casting with BoW/iBow (+41mp5/+49mp5) = 281/289 mp5<br>
Regen while casting with BoK (+60 int + 35spi) = 0.6 * 461mp5 = 276 mp5<br>
<br>
for a grand total of 5/13 mp5 extra from BoW/iBow.<br>
<br>
Moderate increases in your spirit (25 - 50), or larger increases in your intellect (~100) will make BoK strictly better from a pure regen perspective. But even as it stands, you get ~20 extra damage and ~0.8% crit from using BoK, 5.5mp5 per evocate, and 7.5 mp5 per mana tide (innervate is trickier to model and also less probable, so I won't include it here).<br>
<br>
More generally, because the regen formula depends on both your spirit and intellect scores, there are a range of possible int/spi values where BoK will be strictly better than BoW; I believe this has been graphed somewhere in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080506044647/http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t21280-intellect_-_spirit_conversion_ptr_theorycrafting_hq/" target="_blank">2.4 int/spi theorycrafting thread</a>.<br>

</div>Hi Aldor. First, let me begin by saying that I do welcome long post that I can see there was an honest effort put in. And don't get me wrong, its not often I get someone to try and stick by his points. <br>
<br>
With this said, here is what I want to say about your post. I can very easily refute most of your arguments, although you do seem to agree with some of my counterpoints. But here is the major thing. I understand that in your view a lot of small details add up and make arcane really be good for the raid. But, by the very fact that you list a lot of reasons that all ultimately add up and form the core of your argument, its hard to counter-argue with any of your point, which kinds of leads the conversation nowhere. I could easily spend 3 pages talking about how range affects your playstyle. Ultimately, I can't reply and counter-argue with all your points because its hard to follow. Imagine I spend 2 pages talking about the range issue (which BTW I do agree is very minor), if I do that then its hard to remember about all the other points you brought up.<br>
<br>
But putting all of that aside, nobody even, in the first place, disagree with your stance that arcane does well. I feel a bit like were both counter-arguing over the same thing. I did point out far before 2.4 came out that arcane was now viable in 2.4 with the GCD and int/spi changes. Personally I just always reply to anyone that is pro or con any spec, because I cannot accept people only seeing one side of the arguments. Likewise, you'll never see me point out gloriously and link out every 60% crit fire parses I can find with 2900 dps, because its not representative of the spec. It builds up false expectations. Even though I am firespec I don't even like the spec in the first place. Fire can't kill trash with any amount of efficiency. The only spec I believe that was ever good was AM spam. Of course, with this said, I don't philosophically agree with some details about arcane spec, and ultimately I don't use it as a result. But I don't make a post about it because ultimately all of my points are arguable for or against, and its a matter of what your own philosophy of play is. And even if someone made a reply post to my own, I know it wouldn't even change my opinion on the matter (or at least, I would be very surprised I change opinion). Personally I always put dps first. You will not once see me cast mana shield unless its in the most dire cases. If I can avoid using fireward then you can be damn sure I won't. If I can take an extra 4k dmg so I can finish my fireball, then I'm going to do it. Not everyone will agree with it. Its like a matter of boundary. This is where spec choice will vary, and its got nothing even to do with how well a spec does.<br>
<br>
On a sidenote, I never disagreed that arcane spec is better for t5 content/gear. Believe it or not I usually recommend arcane spec to mages asking me what to spec (for some reason it just happened to happen that way). However, I do always assume end-of-game content. I assume that most people that read my guilds forum ultimately goal for that. I could discuss about lower tiers, but I do avoid any of those conversations because to be honest I don't have any interest about it. <br>
<br>
<i>"The main issue I would go for is how many scenarios favor fire and how many Arcane?<br>
[...]<br>
1 Spec is better for 75% of the fights<br>
1 spec is worse for 75% of the fights."</i><br>
<br>
Well, some scenarios will matter more than others. If your guild is hitting a brickwall at eredar twins, for example, then you might want to value extremely highly ice block and cold snap, and its got nothing to do with TC. But for any other fight that I can think of, I wouldn't give a damn about ice block ! You can give me a lot of scenarios, but ultimately, the cases where it matters will vary for each person' opinion because you won't really need ice block until you reach eredar twins. In fact, the only fights I kinda care about right now is brutallus, felmyst and m'uru. To this extent, my valuation of what 'downsides of arcane spec' and what 'downsides of fire specs' are will be naturally very slanted. Since you probably don't know, M'uru is very much the worst anti-arcane fight. Either you aoe non-stop for 5-6min (good luck with that), or you nuke through no less than 63 pushbacks in 5 min (taken from tonights parse). I mean, to me, that just happens to continue to confirm my own beliefs that pushbacks do matter - but if I put m'uru aside, then really pushbacks are non-issue for almost every single fights. As such, until I reach m'uru then, if I were an arcane mage, I would say that pushbacks are non-issue, and you would be right - until you see m'uru. And then your view/weighting on spell pushback from that point on will radically change. So my point here is that you can't either give a bunch of scenarios and compare fire vs arcane, and based on the amount of scenarios where arcane wins vs fire, conclude that spec x is better than spec y. Because ultimately the 'weighting' that each player will give to each scenario will be colored by the perception of the reader. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
(PS: serpent-coil braid is a mage trinket. I use mine very regularly between trash pulls. Granted, I've never used it for dps, but I sitll use it every day)<br>
<br>
I hope my reply covers the grounds a bit as to why I don't think it is productive to argue on specs comparison. And we're not even disagreeing in the first place.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Well, if Arcane, with all its mana regen and high int can't keep up the AOEing, then fire and frost will be even more hard pressed to keep up. I would see a boss that requires heavy aoeing as advantageous to arcane personally, unless ranged aoeing is required. Tidewalker was a long fight with lots of AOEing, and arcane is fine even with the long duration of the fight.<br>
<br>
Pushbacks will definitley hurt again, unless its not a DPS race. In which case, just use arcane missiles for 100% non-interruption. I am wondering if arcane fire might be slightly better than arcane frost on a practical basis (if I want to stick to arcane), simply because arcane fire can still spam fireballs with 70% chance of no pushback as opposed to frost who has to rely on icy veins.<br>
<br>
Arcane fire is only slightly less DPS than arcane frost, but for fights that require range, or with heavy push back, can still do relatively high DPS with fireball spam.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Getting back to TC I was wondering if anyone could tell me for arcane (arcane meditation/mind, mage armor) what value ranges of int/spirit are needed for when the mp5 while casting from kings is greater than that from imp BoW(47mp5??). For the moment for me this is the case with current raid buffs (imp DS, gotw, draenic wisdom, food buff) however on many occasions when we only have 2 paladins available BoW has been the favoured choice (all but one mage is arcane atm and we raid with 4-6). The way I see it for arcane the benefit of extra health, mana pool, crit chance, spell damage etc outweighs the <u>possible</u> lack of mp5 in taking kings over BoW due to gear. If this has been done before please direct me to the forum post.</div>

		<div id="post_message_732783"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->BoK is so incredibly better than BoW given an int-spi build it's not even funny. The mp5 is monumental, the +dmg +crit and higher manapool are all boons, the stamina buff is a free cookie but the most critical part of all is the way it inflates int so much as to make spirit hugely powerful.<br>
<br>
Note, that int and spi scale with themselves. The DPS difference from 300 to 350 crit is not the same as that from 350 to 400. More and more int stacking makes Spi reach such a point where you almost get the same MP5 while casting as you do spirit. Only last week I noticed that fully raidbuffed a Div Spi increased my mp5 casting by about 43mp5! This is much more mp5 than a lowbie T5 and below content mage will see; while crit gets to diminishing returns and spelldamage is more or less linear with progression, mana returns become more and more with increased gear. It doesn't take much imagination to foresee possible WotLK arcane revolving around huge manapools, extremely inefficient spells and massive regen to support them.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I haven't read the whole forum, it's a big gorrilla. I have read a lot of it, but not as much as I'd like too. My main gripe was Arcane not being worth while vs Fire end game.<br>
<br>
Honestly I had planned on spec'ing out of Arcane and into Fire, but only stayed Arcane cause due to my current gear setup my Fire DPS would be sub optimal (lack of decent hit gear, spirit over crit, etc) I'd have to re itemize several peices of gear and change my whole pref list, with current lost DKP on Arcane favored items and such, Fire just is not a route for me. However having played Arcane through most of BT, I haven't seen purported issues with Arcane to be as big a deal as I had read<br>
<br>
I do see issues with mana issues and the need of a SP, which I have an awesome one to work with. However<br>
<br>
Range<br>
Spell Push Back<br>
Lack of Tier 6 set bonuses<br>
Arcane Debuff dropping affecting DPS<br>
<br>
and such are all arguments I saw against Arcane, none of which has been an issue for me with the exception of maybe one or two bosses. Even then there were ways to work around it that mitigated any return Fire might have over Arcane for said fights. I went out of tier 5 and into tier 6 content expecting a huge drop off in damage/viability, even post 2.4 with the spirit/int change. Not knowing how exactly each encounter would favor/hate arcane, I just assumed it was a general consensus that outside of Hyjal raiding Arcane takes a huge drop off, which has not been my experience.<br>

</div>This is where one of my points about itemzation and gear competition comes in, assuming you want to play an end game spec, you really need to start gearing yourself for it starting about 2 instance levels back, I itemized myself for Arcane in T5 and bits of Tier 6, but now my Fire DPS would be serverley gimped because of it. Recomending people spec Arcane for one instance and then Fire for the next is IMO counter productive.<br>

</div>This made me think a bit.  Arcane explosion takes less mana to cast than a full stacked arcane blast.  What immediatly came to mind is casting arcane explosion and popping icy veins and other cooldowns when up and spamming frostbolt.

</div>Well, my point was that, intuitively everyone that has tried m'uru so far has tried to bruteforce it with aoe, since it seems like the proper answer. But if you are good at the fight you realize that aoeing is not an option, which means 5-6min needed for phase 1 alone (of single-target dps).

Well, atleast pre2.4, it seemed as though there was a bigger window for when you can crit than there is now<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Regarding the specific issue of using IV during AB rampup. Yes, using IV would "negate" the loss the of dps, but only in the short term. You're not looking at the opportunity cost. You would be trading the ability to stack IV with dmg trinkets for a full burn later on.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I'm not sure I follow. Yes, the mechanics are similar in that a debuff is applied as the result of spell impact (as opposed to spell cast). But its entirely possible that Blizzard would hotfix ignite with some hacky logic, without fixing the underlying issue of how effects on impact are handled.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_733062"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'm curious if this new Haste Dagger with its current stats will make it live. I can think of a couple ways how this thing could be abused, most of them probably not intended. I believe these haven't been mentioned yet:<br>
<br>
- AE: Arcane Explosion scales much better with Haste than with any other stat, making this a superior Weapon for AE (if you  have enough mana to not run OOM that is)<br>
- Evocate: Consider the following use when in need of Evocation: Switch to your Haste-Dagger during your last Fireball before Evocation, hit Evocation with the Haste Dagger equipped, cast your next Fireball afterwards and switch back to your Spelldamage Weapon during this cast. You effectively traded 1x Spellhaste Bonus vs. 1x Spelldamage Bonus but also got full benefit for Evocation in the process.<br>
<br>
I wouldn't be suprised if there where a lot of more possibilities with this Weapon, though i probably won't get it myself due to the Arena Requirement.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I've been toying around on the PTR, with 182 and 209 passive haste and popping skull/comb/IV (=&gt; ~2.0s cast time).<br>
I've been standing at ~32 and ~40 yards range, and could usually get one ignite to bug out.<br>

I'll test more later, and try to figure out if the weapon swap GCD is fixed at 1.5s or affected by haste.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yeah, I was a bit excited about it as well and then remembered that switching weapons trigger a GCD.  There is no point in switching to a haste weapon right before casts, losing 1-1.5s, to gain 227 spell haste.  The second triggered GCD is during your cast (switching from haste -&gt; damage weapon) so there'd be no loss there, leaving you with just being able to do it at the pull + anytime that you're not casting due to movement, bubble on boss, etc. like you said.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I don't disagree, but the point remains that there was a noticeable change in ignite delay and handling in 2.4.  I didn't have time for more than a cursory trip to the Doctor last night, but before we spend several more pages considering the feasibility of passive 2s fireballs and the resultant ignite shenanigans it would be nice to see some experimental validation.  Pre 2.3 it was very very easy to reproduce with scorches and a little lag, 2.3 made it harder with spell queueing, but still experimentally reproducible.  I have yet to see or produce a valid ignite gain this patch, although I'm under 10 minutes real testing, and I'm unfortunately poorly geared to produce large parses of 1.9-2.1s fireballs.<br>
<br>
To Faxmonkey's point, although you stand less of a chance of clipping with the reduced GCD, stacking large amounts of passive haste (especially at the cost of equivalent or better damage) should still be taken in proper context.  In this case, assuming ~1500+dmg the swap would give you a ~15% casting speed increase, but you'd take a 16% hit on your +dmg (using tempest as the theoretical weapon) and your dpm would also get a similar shanking.  Once you start having to chug manas instead of destros and flame caps, it would seem you'd be hitting the realm of diminishing returns on haste; especially if you start having to sacrifice dmg consumables for sustainability consumables.<br>
<br>
In any case, that'd be something for the spreadsheets.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I don't think that will work since casting time is determined at the start of the cast and unmodified by any conditions that occur during the cast.  For spirit and int weapon swap it worked because the regen itself that occured during the channel was what was being changed by the swap.  <br>
<br>
If bloodlusted while you are midway through an evocation does the channel speed up?  or conversely if you have bloodlust in effect at the start of evocate does the channel slow down if the bloodlust wears off midway through?<br>
<br>
Edited to add:<br>
<br>
Just tested it very roughly in Shatt.  Made an evoc set containing the badge haste offhand and the SWP trash wand (with a haste gem in place).  Then put on chronicle and my badge wand (stam gem) and compared.  Without the haste offhand and wand Evoc should be 9.15 according to the tooltip with the haste it should drop down to 8.91 with them.  Hit Evocate (autoequipping the haste offhand and wand) and quartz showed my casting bar at 9.15 for the channel.  The tooltip changed to reflect the new channeled time but the cast bar did not.  Someone will need probably need to play with a stopwatch to see if reality is any different then what was shown by the castbar. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Also so as to not clutter up the forums with additional posts.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Since you probably don't know, M'uru is very much the worst anti-arcane fight. Either you aoe non-stop for 5-6min (good luck with that), or you nuke through no less than 63 pushbacks in 5 min (taken from tonights parse). I mean, to me, that just happens to continue to confirm my own beliefs that pushbacks do matter - but if I put m'uru aside, then really pushbacks are non-issue for almost every single fights. As such, until I reach m'uru then, if I were an arcane mage, I would say that pushbacks are non-issue, and you would be right - until you see m'uru. And then your view/weighting on spell pushback from that point on will radically change. So my point here is that you can't either give a bunch of scenarios and compare fire vs arcane, and based on the amount of scenarios where arcane wins vs fire, conclude that spec x is better than spec y. Because ultimately the 'weighting' that each player will give to each scenario will be colored by the perception of the reader. </div>

</div>Manly, 63 instances of pushback over 5 minutes is 21%.  Running 2T5 4T6 with Cowl and Hex + SCB that would bring my single target dps down to 2191 using Adept's + Wisdom and being grouped with an Elemental Shaman + Shadowpriest (yes I know a Resto shaman is better for an Arc/Frost mage but that's the group I am lucky enough to get so I ain't fighting it).  <br>
<br>
For a Fire spec in similar gear (7T6 + Cowl) + Hex and Quag Eye (I don't have a skull so ain't counting it in for either spec option) in the same group and using Death Flasks and with Sunfire on Tempest (instead of Major Spellpower) that 21% pushback drops the dps to 2198.<br>
<br>
Go figure, it ain't hurt as much as I thought it would be. Although if the pushback was even worse I could always just stick on 2T4 2T5 4T6 and gain back some of the ~66dps I lose equipping the 2 best pieces of T4 (helm and gloves) by having uninterruptable Frostbolts.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Go figure, it ain't hurt as much as I thought it would be. Although if the pushback was even worse I could always just stick on 2T4 2T5 4T6 and gain back some of the ~66dps I lose equipping the 2 best pieces of T4 (helm and gloves) by having uninterruptable Frostbolts.</div>

I was just pointing out that yes pushback does hurt Arc/Frost but it hurts Fire too and the dps loss isn't as substantial as you make it out to be.  A lot of Arcane's dps comes from combining cooldowns (same with Fire) and the xtra use of Icy Veins along with 2 uses of AP to go with them makes up for a lot of lost dps due to pushback along the way.<br>
<br>
I've been saying this all along, both specs are completely viable in Sunwell and personal performance and raid support will play more of a role in which one works better on specific encounters then any differences between them.  That is until you get 3 or more pieces of offset SWP loot (shoulders, legs, helm, gloves or chest) once you get that then Fire will definitely scale better just because the 2T5 bonus can't keep up with the sheer ilevel difference between the 2 T5 pieces and the SWP loot that would be replacing them.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The nice thing about the current state of the mage class is that there are 2 viable end-game raiding specs that offer very different play styles.<br>
<br>
The bad thing about the current state of the mage class in end-game raiding is that Deep Frost isn't viable since the pet doesn't scale with 4T6 or with any of the caster's ratings and Arcane is forced to use 2 pieces of low ilevel gear to be competitive.  Set bonuses should be just that, bonuses, not necessities for a spec to be viable in the first place.<br>

</div>I would be very surprised if the moment you guys figure out how to make rolling ignites reliable through itemization Blizzard doesn't hotfix the situation to completely invalidate the technique.  They obviously don't want rolling ignites, even personal ones (not a clue why that is but it's very obvious from the current mechanism), and if you guys find a way to make it 100% replicable instead of an occassional bonus I would bet a lot of gold that it gets closed completely very soon thereafter.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>You're confusing the issue, Arcanis's post comes at my request for proof that rolling ignites in any form have made it live through 2.4, as no focused testing had been done on the mechanic since 2.3 (or at least no one responded to my previous request for parses).  Theorycrafting based on quirks from previous patches without current confirmation is never a good idea. Also, what is actually being suggested is that with the new itemization you can obtain the necessary <i>passive</i> haste to drop to 2s fireballs and gain extra ignite ticks reliably, and that doing so is worth sacrificing a significant amount of stats for.<br>
<br>
Unrelated but to Rounce; Fire has 70% passive pushback resistance (100% with conc aura), Arcane/Frost has 0. Pushback affects arcane builds far more than fire builds, and I really don't understand how you can argue otherwise. Teron parses, especially new longer ones where lots of death blooms have a chance to spawn, consistently show moderate to severe penalties applied to DPS classes with no pushback resistance.  Although I agree both specs have their benefits in terms of overall viability, arcane is not, in any way, on an equal footing in a pushback heavy fight.  Their may be other aspects of the Mu'ru fight worth considering as arcane, but really pushback is going to be something an A/F build will be working against.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The cast time cant' be 2 seconds anymore.  Try this, get a 1.9ish second cast Fireball (downranking is probably easiest) and then stand at MAX range on Dr. Boom.<br>
<br>
Watch carefully, you will NEVER see ignite tick until AFTER a fireball has landed at not crit. It just doesn't happen. Even at max range the ignite tick gets pushed back a full 2 seconds if you crit (in which case, the damage does roll over and can lead to big damage, but not *extra* damage) or ignite ticks AFTER you don't crit (but after your fireball hits).<br>
<br>
There is simply no scenario in which ignite ticks AND THEN fireball crits if you have sub 2.0 second cast time.  There's a delay on ignite that makes this impossible.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind, simply because you see a large ignite tick does not mean your ignites are rolling.  Say you crit 5 times in a row for the same amount, each tick should do x damage.  With sub 2.0 Fireballs, even standing at max range, you'll see this.<br>
<br>
Fireball crits.<br>
Fireball Crits.<br>
Fireball crits.<br>
Fireball Crits.<br>
Fireballcrits.<br>
Fireball hits.<br>
Ignite hits for 5x.<br>
Ingnite hits for 5x.<br>
<br>
A big ignite tick, yes, but not a "rolling" ignite.  There's no extra damage there.  That's the only scenario possible with sub 2.0 Fireballs you'd need like 1.5 seconds of travel time to have ignite tick AFTER you cast a fireball, but before it lands -- and 1 seconds is the most possible travel time on a Fireball.<br>
<br>
True rolling ignites would look like this:<br>
<br>
Fireball crits.<br>
Ignite ticks for X.<br>
Fireball Crits.<br>
Ignite ticks for 2x.<br>
Fireball crits.<br>
Ignite ticks for 3x.<br>
Fireball Crits.<br>
Ignite ticks for 4x.<br>
Fireball crits.<br>
Ignite ticks for 5x.<br>
Fireball hits.<br>
Ignite ticks for 5x.<br>
<br>
<br>
Not JUST big numbers, but actual extra damage.  You were supposed to get 10x damage total, but instead with *true* rolling ignites you get 20x.  I have *NOT* Seen this behavior in 2.4.  If it's still possible, it requires *LONGER* than 2 second casts to compensate for the added delay in the first ignite tick.<br>
<br>
Edit: And just to be 100% clear here, I played around with 2 second cast fireballs and here's what I found.<br>
<br>
For rolling ignites to work, in theory, you need to crit, cast a second fireball, have ignite tick AFTER the second Fireball is already in the air, then have that Fireball Crit when it lands.  So for rolling ignites to happen, cast time &lt; time it takes ignite to tick but cast time + Travel time must be &gt; time it takes ignite to tick.  The time it takes ignite to tick, currently, is around 3 seconds.  You think its 2? It's not.  There's about 1 second after a crit before the ignite debuff is applied to the crit target.  Has that always been there pre 2.4? I can't say.  But basically you're looking at about 3+ seconds from time you crit, till the first ignite tick happens. Sub 2.0 cast + travel time cannot possibly be more than 3 seconds, thus that scenario can never actually happen with Fireballs that fast.  Travel time max is roughly a second.<br>
<br>
SO maybe its still possible with a slower cast time Fireball? Like 2.2 seconds or 2.4 seconds? Well maybe, I have no idea.  I'm just saying, that the only type of ignite pattern you'll ever see with successive sub-2.0 second Fireball crits is the "no ignite ticks utnil you stop critting, then two big ones" pattern.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Manly said that Arc/Frost would be non-viable on Mu'ruu due to the pushback so I originally started making the post suggesting 2T4 2T5 4T6 as a way to deal with it (I was Frost when we first got to RoS and pushback sucked enough that sticking 2T4 on was enough of a bonus to offset the gear downgrade).  Started to run figures on Rawr to see what would happen with that level of pushback and was very surprised by the results I got.<br>
<br>
Note that I was running Rawr with my current gear pool which consists of no skull, 8/8 T6, 3/5 T5, 5/5 T4, ToC, Chronicle, etc etc.  I don't have any offset pieces from SWP yet so I ran Fire from what I would use if I was specced that way from my gear pool and I ran Arc/Frost the same way.  My gear is all gemmed for damage or damage/haste (no int or spirit or mana/5 gems) and when I changed the gear around to represent Fire I changed the weapon enchant to Sunfire.<br>
<br>
Notice the results.  Arc/Frost was 8dps lower then 2/48/11.  That's with adding in Manly's interrupt frequency numbers.  So I'm a bit confused what it is exactly that you are trying to tell me?  <br>
<br>
Either Rawr is borked and completely unreliable in regards to dealing with interruptions (although its been right on the money for Brutallus and the dps lose from soaking interruptions) or maybe there is more going on then you are willing to recognize and instead of dealing with real figures instead fall back on conjecture and speculation and closed mindedness.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>As Wran said, my post was a response to his question about whether or not "rolling ignites" are still possible as of 2.4.  I went really quick last night to check it out and found that it was but that the window of opportunity to steal the extra ignite tick seems to be a lot smaller.  Before 2.4 I used to be able to do it with a lot more ease.  As of 2.4 it seems as though I can't get it to work unless my crit lands at nearly the exact moment that ignite ticks.<br>
<br>
I was not trying to show how to force rolling ignites to happen, merely that they still CAN happen, but with more difficulty.  Then again, I might have just been getting unlucky, and I can't really know for sure until I run further tests.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Manly said that Arc/Frost would be non-viable on Mu'ruu due to the pushback so I originally started making the post suggesting 2T4 2T5 4T6 as a way to deal with it (I was Frost when we first got to RoS and pushback sucked enough that sticking 2T4 on was enough of a bonus to offset the gear downgrade).  Started to run figures on Rawr to see what would happen with that level of pushback and was very surprised by the results I got.<br>
<br>
Note that I was running Rawr with my current gear pool which consists of no skull, 8/8 T6, 3/5 T5, 5/5 T4, ToC, Chronicle, etc etc.  I don't have any offset pieces from SWP yet so I ran Fire from what I would use if I was specced that way from my gear pool and I ran Arc/Frost the same way.  My gear is all gemmed for damage or damage/haste (no int or spirit or mana/5 gems) and when I changed the gear around to represent Fire I changed the weapon enchant to Sunfire.<br>
<br>
Notice the results.  Arc/Frost was 8dps lower then 2/48/11.  That's with adding in Manly's interrupt frequency numbers.  So I'm a bit confused what it is exactly that you are trying to tell me?  <br>
<br>
Either Rawr is borked and completely unreliable in regards to dealing with interruptions (although its been right on the money for Brutallus and the dps lose from soaking interruptions) or maybe there is more going on then you are willing to recognize and instead of dealing with real figures instead fall back on conjecture and speculation and closed mindedness.</div>

</div>I think you misunderstand, your post implies that deep fire and A/F are similarly affected by pushback effects; with fire's 70% passive resistance to pushback, and arcane frost having 0, I would be extremely skeptical of any numbers that show an equivalent %dps reduction from a fight with no pushback.  What your numbers suggest is that for your gear and group make up arcane has as much higher theoretical ceiling, not that it is necessarily less affected by pushback.  Rawr may also be handling interrupts as cast stoppages, not pushback, in which case the passive fire resistance would be inconsequential.

</div>That is interesting, and makes sense in the context of the spells cast; but the DPS loss seems out of proportion with what I'd expect in overall lost cast time.  at 61 interrupts over 5 minutes you're looking at a minute of lost cast time, I guess I was expecting something more in the 10-15% DPS loss, instead of the &lt;5%  range for that kind of interrupt frequency.  From a play feel standpoint I actually wonder if you'd really notice it that much if it's that small?<br>
<br>
The other question is if Manly is registering 60 Fire pushbacks (he's mitigating 70% already, so more like 200 total registered hits).  Looking forward to that fight, hope to see it next week.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

They're still on live, and casting time is just under 2s per fireball.  As previously illustrated, the crit must land moments before the ignite is registered to "steal" the extra tick.  The window here is very tight, under a tenth of a second.  This has interesting implications on how close you'll need to shave it with your passive haste to see consistent results.</div>

</div>Interestingly enough, you got your ignite to roll off the second tick, not the first.  Which is a slightly different scenario. You'd need every other spell to crit, not multiple crits in row.  Even with what you posted there, multiple crits in a row were too fast to cause rolling.<br>
<br>
 However, that said, look at your time stamps.  You're fireballs were slightly MORE than 2 seconds apart.  Those are 2.1 second cast Fireballs according to your timestamps -- at least after factoring in whatever latency you might have had.  In other words, this doesn't seem strong evidence to discount my "2 seconds is *too* fast theory.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>If you make a rough estimate ignoring spell haste and latency then each individual cast has a 61 * 1.5 / 300 = 30% chance to get interrupted. Of these 30% there is 2/3 chance that interrupt will happen during the first second of a cast, 1/3 chance that it will happen after. If the pushback is during the first 1 sec on average you will lose 0.5 seconds (since you lose 0 if you get interrupted at the very start or full second if you get it at 1 second point and we assume the distribution is uniform). On average the pushback on individual spell will be 30% * (2/3 * 0.5 sec + 1/3 * 1 sec) = 30% * 66% * 1 sec = 0.2 sec. So if this was the end of the story the dps lost on average would be 1 - 1.5/1.7 ~ 12%.<br>
<br>
So the dps of AB will be 12% lower, similarly for Frostbolt 14% lower. What just happened is both AB and Frostbolt became lower dps, but mana cost also lowered while your mana income stays the same. Since arcane is more or less mana limited that means that since mana income is the same you will be able to get out almost the same ammount of damage. Where the lower dps really makes an impact is during cooldowns. That means the value of each cooldown is about 12-14% lower and that accumulates to the range of 5% over the whole fight. If you would have an example where you're not mana limited (meaning you can spam AB 100% of time) then the overall dps loss would be much closer to 12-14% that you were expecting.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Quick favor, would you mind checking to see if 2T4 is working correctly because I am showing a significant dps loss just in regards to Frostbolt as I increase the interrupt frequency (which implies 2T4 isn't doing anything currently).<br>

</div>I was assuming that Manly was saying 61 instances of his taking damage that would cause pushback not 61 specific instances of pushback.  If it was 61 specific instances of pushback with a Fire spec that definitely does change the situation and would clearly make that fight very ugly for Arcane, although not impossibly so.  If it was 200 instances of pushback (which is a literally shit ton of interruption basically on par with RoS) I would just wear 2T4, 2T5 and 4T6 and just spam Frostbolts except when blowing cooldowns with Icy Veins where I would be spamming Arcane Blast.  <br>
<br>
If we took the 200 instances of pushback model as reality then that would be 67% interruption.  That would bring Arc/Frost down from 2312 to 1983dps.  Wearing 2T4 2T5 4T6 drops base dps to 2244 which would/should be mitigated by Frostbolt having no pushback at all, however since Rawr doesn't seem to currently model 2T4 it is difficult to theorize what the overall dps would end up being.<br>

Definitely would be a much more significant dps loss then would be seen with Fire though. Fire would start at 2308dps (7/8 T6 + Cowl no Skull) and that level of interruption would drop it down to 2056dps.  Although it is interesting to note that switching in 2T4 (helm and shoulders) gives 2171dps so in a situation with that much pushback it would be better to break out 2T4 then to stay in normal raid gear.  If it's the 21% (61 instances of damage that could have caused pushback) then staying in normal raid gear would yield 2198dps so it wouldn't be worth breaking out 2T4 in that case.<br>
<br>
Very interesting to say the least and really can't wait to get to Mu'ruu so I can test out all this theorycraft.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_734148"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I havent done any modelling of this yet so I cannot claim that this can in fact increase the DPS of arcane, but one thing I want to throw out here that I dont think has been discussed yet is the following. As everybody knows, when we're arcane blasting we generally do AB -&gt; FB -&gt; AB -&gt; FB -&gt; AB -&gt; FB until all the debuffs are applied. The reason is because the cast time of the spell is calculated when the spell is started and the mana cost is calculated when it is completed costing more because the debuff gets applied midway. Now the way we do our rotation nowadays is to keep the AB up constantly throughout the fight so that we dont have to waste time reapplying the debuffs after it is dropped. But what if we timed it accurately enough where we did let it drop to decrease the cost of that specific AB cast and still keep the same casting speed. So the new rotation would still apply debuffs as normal, then instead of mixing frostbolts in with the AB casts, it would be pure AB spam, (to the discretion of the mage) frostbolt spam, and at approximately 1 second remaining in the debuff, another AB cast followed if necessary by more frostbolts and then reapply the remaining AB debuffs and repeat the process.<br>
<br>
Like I said, I havent done any hard math on this just been running the concept through my head. What I see this bringing to the table are a few pros and logically a few cons.<br>
<br>
1) The reduced mana cost of the last AB cast with still the same DPS (if you're looking at that one spell)<br>
<br>
2) Extra time has to be spent re-applying the remaining two debuffs, losing approximately 1.5 seconds worth of DPS reapplying. This is presuming that there are only two debuffs left to reapply because the first one should already be there after the 'last' AB cast of the previous rotation.<br>
<br>
3) Since you do spend less mana reapplying AB your mana efficiency goes up, as others have mentioned before regarding AB spam, losing the debuff isnt the end of the world because even though their DPS goes down, they have more mana to work with allowing for longer sustained DPS.<br>
<br>
4) It might be hard to time this properly without having to sit and wait for the debuff to reach the target remaining time. If a player ever does stop DPSing completely just to do this specific rotation I'm positive that it cannot be beneficial for net DPS.<br>
<br>
So yeah...the main reason I havent modelled this on my own yet is because Im having some difficulty figuring out all of the specific numbers. I'm not going out here saying that this is in fact a better way to DPS, I cant really know that at this point but I do know its possible that this can increase DPS marginally if done correctly.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Indeed. From what I can tell, the new ring basically matches <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33497" target="_blank">[Mana Attuned Band]</a> in DPS value for a well-geared T6 mage, without deriving any of that value from spell hit.

</div>If you're right, that could pave the way for drum-like "power circle rotations" where casters take turns activating their trinkets to maintain the greatest possible amount of buff time for the raid. But if that's the case, would it apply to anyone in the raid who stands in the circle? Just the caster's party? Or the caster alone? I'm not going to get my hopes up that it's anything but a self-buff until we learn more about it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

There is a very good caster dps trinket named Shifting Naaru Silver with 54 spellhaste which can definately replace Hex Shrunken Head and there is also a new ring named Ring of Omnipotence.<br>
<br>
As for the stats as I don't know if I can link the items yet here.<br>
<br>
Shifting Naaru Silver:<br>
Equip: Improves Spell Haste Rating by 54.<br>
Use: Conjures a Power Circle lasting for 15 seconds. While standing in this circle, the caster gains up to 320 spell damage and healing. (2 minutes cooldown)<br>
<br>
Ring of Omnipotence:<br>
+21 Stamina<br>
+14 Intellect<br>
Equip: Improves Spell Haste Rating by 31.<br>
Equip: Improves Spell Critical Rating by 22.<br>
Equip: Increases damage and healing done by magical spells and effects by up to 40.<br>
<br>
This ring seems to be definately the best in slot and I guess you can replace Mana Attuned Band and use Chronicle of Dark Secrets as for having the best gear.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_734217"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->An easy way to do this would be to armory some of the people posting here, since Im already posting though ill just quickly give the basic one. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080507091606/http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/classes/mage/talents.html?tal=2000000000000000000000050520201230333115312510430003010000000000000" target="_blank">Basic Build</a><br>
<br>
A few things to point out, not all of the talents there are required...I consider pyroblast, blastwave and blazing speed to be fillers instead of actual talents that I aim to get, along the same lines I can also say the same thing for dragons breath as well.. The basic idea is to get -every- spell that increases your DPS, so any of the +crit%, +fire spell damage % and stuff like that is basically mandatory. After that you also always want  burning soul for the reduced threat and less chance of pushback (helpful sometimes) and master of elements for the mana returns.<br>
<br>
On the frost side, all you need is the 3 in elemental precision and icy veins. Everything else is pretty much preference, I like the imp frostbolt and permafrost so that I can throw fast rank 1 frostbolts that slow more than otherwise but still dont have the chance of putting them through frostbite.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I dont know where you read that you lose ignite ticks from the consecutive crits with icy veins. I've heard that its next to impossible to bug it out and -gain- additional ticks, but if you are only fireball spamming (no fireblast or scorch included when you are using your combustion) the only possible change in DPS will be an increase. You can see the following thread that I get my data from.<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080507091606/http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t19766-mage_rolling_ignites_they_back/p7/" target="_blank">Rolling Ignites</a><br>
 Long story short, its possible to 'gain' an extra ignite tick if you have hte right cast time and time your casts right. You can also lose an ignite completely if you cast fireblast immediately after another spell that crits as well. For the purposes of this topic however, we can safely say that you will NOT lose any ignite damage from chain critting fireballs.<br>
<br>
With that in mind, you should stick with your original macro, as you probably determined, if you have everything stuck together the extra ignites from combustion will crit just that much more with the trinkets and then you're extra spells from icy veins will have that much more damage as well.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I havent done any modelling of this yet so I cannot claim that this can in fact increase the DPS of arcane, but one thing I want to throw out here that I dont think has been discussed yet is the following. As everybody knows, when we're arcane blasting we generally do AB -&gt; FB -&gt; AB -&gt; FB -&gt; AB -&gt; FB until all the debuffs are applied. The reason is because the cast time of the spell is calculated when the spell is started and the mana cost is calculated when it is completed costing more because the debuff gets applied midway. Now the way we do our rotation nowadays is to keep the AB up constantly throughout the fight so that we dont have to waste time reapplying the debuffs after it is dropped. But what if we timed it accurately enough where we did let it drop to decrease the cost of that specific AB cast and still keep the same casting speed. So the new rotation would still apply debuffs as normal, then instead of mixing frostbolts in with the AB casts, it would be pure AB spam, (to the discretion of the mage) frostbolt spam, and at approximately 1 second remaining in the debuff, another AB cast followed if necessary by more frostbolts and then reapply the remaining AB debuffs and repeat the process.<br>
<br>
Like I said, I havent done any hard math on this just been running the concept through my head. What I see this bringing to the table are a few pros and logically a few cons.<br>

</div>It's 320 damage (<b>15s</b>/120s), which is comparable to 240 damage (20s/120s).<br>
It's actually better than that, because you can stack this trinket and 5 seconds of your second trinket into IV, or this and 15s of your second trinket into drums. I can't quanify that difference though.<br>
Haven't found whether it shares CDs with other trinkets. It probably does. If not, stacking would make it very powerful.<br>

"According to winternight from Sk a GM confirmed that anyone within the circle will get the buff, no matter if he's in your group or not, but that it is currently bugged and works only for yourself. In any way, it's definitely the best trinket to get along with the skull."<br>

</div>I agree with the first sentiment. There is no way in hell it will be a group or party buff. You can happily re-quote me this and I will eat my mouse if it is made reality.<br>
<br>
I can think of a hundred situations when it would make many of the fights (That I've seen in my pre-Illidan guild, thought I've watched vids of other fights in Sunwell) utterly trivial even if it just affected the party ; so a GM saying it would affect the whole raid is beyond ridiculous.<br>
<br>
I will actually eat my mouse if it happens. I'll video it for you.<br>
<br>
Edit: I'd like to add that as the poster two above me says ; it's a very clever way to prevent it's (mis?)use in pvp. Generally speaking, a stationary caster is a dead caster ; so by using the circle on the floor mechanic it would be mostly a pve only trinket. Altho BGs ofc like AV would be an exception but again ... no real harm done. <br>
<br>
Potentially the mechanic has its pitfalls ; I can imagine some bugs such as encountered with SoC in instances between of the damage going vertically to mobs above the victim ; for example is there a delay on when he/she enters? How long does it last once out ; how does latency affect it ; does it add the damage at the start of the cast or on spell hit? (soulfire at the end of casting normal spells for extra benefit? - I don't know which would be the worst/best example, I'm just suggesting possible flaws in this "circle on floor" idea... <br>
<br>
Really, really interesting concept though ; Praise to the developer who suggested it. We've had AoE debuffs for ages, and even buffs (the columns of light in Karazhan, for example) ; but generally the debuffs always work, and the buffs are usually rubbish (delays on entering ; visually you think you're in the effect but the game says you're not and you don't get the benefit ; etc etc) .. so I for one, can't wait to see this in action.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_734786"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->But if the effect is just only to self, why even bother goign to the trouble of having a circle of effect? Isn't it better to just make it like icon so that you won't lose the buff even if you blink or something? <br>
<br>
If the effect extends only to self, there is higher risk because the mage may move out of the circle during the duration of the buff. It only makes sense if the buff can affect more than one person if its a circle. What's the point of having this circle like buff which no one else but the mage can interact with?<br>
<br>
I don't think the developers would go to the trouble of coding such a circle if they didn't mean for more than just the mage/cacstor to get the buff. They might as well have just made it an activation trinket like icon, etc if they just wanted the buff to affect only the castor.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_734803"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->As others have stated, by forcing the caster to stay in the circle to receive the buff, the item designers can make powerful PvE burst trinkets without unbalancing arena PvP - as a caster in arena you can't stand in one spot for any length of time unless your opponents are imbeciles (or have no melee).<br>
<br>
Also it reinforces the idea that some forethought should be taken before popping cooldowns - ideally you want to pop them  when you are going to have 15 - 20s of uninterrupted casting time (or longer with bloodlust). Normally being forced to move by boss mechanic Y just reduces the amount of time you have to cast with the cooldowns active; now you can be forced to forfeit the remainder of the cooldown entirely. Additional strategic considerations like this are a good thing, I think.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

If you want to enforce the whole no moving thing, make it a buff that cancels when you move. Adding the whole "Power Circle" dynamic seems a total waste of time/code/resources when something equally as effective but much more simple could have been used, <i>if</i> it's intended as a self-buff only.

		<div id="post_message_734824"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Causing the buff to be cancelled upon any movement at all seems a bit harsh, and makes the effect less interesting strategically (as there is no analogue to being able to get back into the circle after moving). Additionally the whole "circle of power" thing is a familar (and kinda cool) fantasy concept.<br>
<br>
We will just have to wait and see but the consequences of the buff being group- or raid-shareable just seem so extreme. If the buff is stackable you would have insane burst damage potential (5 x 320 = 1600 extra +damage for the duration). If not stackable, then there is still the option to chain use the trinkets back to back, giving the equivalent of 3 Wrath of Air totems or about three tiers worth of gear 62% of the time (if group-shareable only) or 100% if raid-shareable, once you get eight trinkets.

</div>My thread specifically said that rolling ignites only occur only on &gt; 2s casts. Sub-2s will not work. Also, all the evidence I have points towards travel time having no real impact on the results. It will, but only indirectly. What causes the bug has got nothing to do with travel time, and is very easy to prove/test using only scorches and/or fireblasts. <i>What you want is to use the time it takes for debuffs to be applied, and get a tick during that time window.</i> This is due to the fact that, as my thread pointed out, not only spell total damage, but the ignite is also calculated upon finishing a cast, but the application of the ignite is delayed. At the time of cast of the 2nd spell, it calculates ignite dmg based on the current ignite_left_to_be_done + current_spell_ignite_to_add. If you get an ignite tick in-between, that tick is free damage. The reason is that the ignite application will take ~100ms, and the rolling ignite behavior is perfectly consistent with the theory.<br>

When I pointed out that firespec would have the upper hand on supremus due to range, of course I didnt mean that actually would be the spec to go for.

</div>I dunno, I think we're sort of splitting hairs about the same thing that's been in game since 2.1.  And yes, I screwed up, Arcanis's parses, and indeed all parses that show these extra ticks have fireball casting times of slightly more than 2.0s; not under 2s.  What is appealing about this is that there may be a small magic number haste window that will allow consistent rolling ignites.  Using the parses Arcanis provided, we can suppose that ignite has a reasonably uniform 100ms delay, and that to consistently hit the window a 2.09s casting speed would be ideal.  For fireball, this would mean a haste rating of 684; as the window would appear to be about 10ms long I'd say you could go from 684 to 675 haste and still hit this.  Now we just need some data with provided haste ratings to back this up, or show a longer/shorter haste window.<br>
<br>
It occurs to me that if you still have your MQG, it would be a very nice trinket to play with for this; as it provides a meaty 330 haste for 20s. Using IV is a little bit of a crutch since it's a mod, and not a flat haste rating bonus.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Well, some scenarios will matter more than others. If your guild is hitting a brickwall at eredar twins, for example, then you might want to value extremely highly ice block and cold snap, and its got nothing to do with TC. But for any other fight that I can think of, I wouldn't give a damn about ice block ! You can give me a lot of scenarios, but ultimately, the cases where it matters will vary for each person' opinion because you won't really need ice block until you reach eredar twins. In fact, the only fights I kinda care about right now is brutallus, felmyst and m'uru. To this extent, my valuation of what 'downsides of arcane spec' and what 'downsides of fire specs' are will be naturally very slanted. <b>Since you probably don't know, M'uru is very much the worst anti-arcane fight.</b> Either you aoe non-stop for 5-6min (good luck with that), or you nuke through no less than 63 pushbacks in 5 min (taken from tonights parse). I mean, to me, that just happens to continue to confirm my own beliefs that pushbacks do matter - but if I put m'uru aside, then really pushbacks are non-issue for almost every single fights. As such, until I reach m'uru then, if I were an arcane mage, I would say that pushbacks are non-issue, and you would be right - until you see m'uru. And then your view/weighting on spell pushback from that point on will radically change. So my point here is that you can't either give a bunch of scenarios and compare fire vs arcane, and based on the amount of scenarios where arcane wins vs fire, conclude that spec x is better than spec y. Because ultimately the 'weighting' that each player will give to each scenario will be colored by the perception of the reader. </div>

<br>
For a Fire spec in similar gear, 7T6 + Cowl + Hex and Quag Eye (I don't have a skull so ain't counting it in for either spec option), in the same group and using Death Flasks and with Sunfire on Tempest (instead of Major Spellpower) that 21% pushback drops the dps to 2198.<br>

Go figure, it ain't hurt as much as I thought it would be. Although if the pushback was even worse I could always just stick on 2T4 2T5 4T6 and gain back some of the ~66dps I lose equipping the 2 best pieces of T4 (helm and gloves) by having uninterruptable Frostbolts.</div>

Maybe you just haven't played with the spec enough to be able to maximize it's performance?  It's a pretty big difference between the 2 specs and it can take awhile to get used to what is needed to maximize your performance as Arc/Frost.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yeah, he is. Just finished our third night on him this week, and I'm not even remotely exaggerating when I say the entire raid has to be flawless. In regards to your math though, the pushback comes at various times, it's not just a continuous burn on him that can be easily modeled. You have to move around a good bit, probably aoe some (at range), and you'll probably have to sheep multiple times. The real kicker for me was that the aoe is generally done at range - it has to be Flamestrike/Blizzard. I hate to press farther in lieu of the spoiler rules, but as I said I just didn't find Arcane to viable at all for M'uru.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yes, and how would you make a fight <i>really</i> bad for arcane ? This is pretty much it. Thats a worst-case scenario, or as close as it gets. Does that means the spec is unable to compete ? Not really. Is arcane bad on Eredar Twins because fire can spellsteal pyrogenics for +35% fire dmg ? Not really. If you want to make a worst-case fire-spec scenario, it would probably involve lots of movement (but not due to range, move like 'move away from volcanos'), have tons of aggro resets, and lots of adds, ideally 6-8 just so that your aoe can't shine, and you can't stack scorch. Or a stream of low hp mobs that constantly come (think vashj-style elementals). Would that scenario make fire unable to compete ? No, it would just particularly suck to be that spec.<br>
<br>
My point was specifically about the fact that comparing specs will not work because everyone will value the downsides/upsides of specs differently based on their current content. M'uru is a great example because before that you won't find a place where pushbacks become significant. There was teron back then, but as guilds started to kill it fast it quickly became non-issue (higher icy veins uptime, more bloodlust uptime, all ultimately leading to less impact from pushbacks).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_735730"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I have a question about the damage values used to derive the relative damage worth of hit/crit/haste points.<br>
<br>
I like to do my own calcs when possible, but whenever I see others post ratios they're always much lower valued than my own numbers indicate, so obviously the base assumptions differ somewhere.<br>
<br>
Since the damage worth of an added hit/crit/haste point depends on your current average main nuke output, I've always used recent WWS numbers to work out the coefficients. This is to get as true a value as possible, taking all raid buffs into account. However I'm beginning to worry that this makes me overvalue stats like haste (my initial calcs when it was widely itemised told me it really rocked, while many others shunned it outright).

		<div id="post_message_735734"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I've been discussing with a friend about how multiple firemages improve each other's DPS. Common misconception is that the ability to drop a percentage of the scorching will greatly increase everyone's damage.<br>
I took a mage needing to kill Brutallus (a fight where DPS is the core) and assigned him the best gear available for the level of progression, an elemental shaman and full buffs.<br>
Result was 1480 DPS, 1,36 casting time on scorch, 2018 DPS, 2,73 casting time on fireball. (can change a bit, but it's not relevant). Difference is 538 dps.<br>
Now let's say you are the only firemage in group. You will have to re-cast Scorch every 25 seconds circa, plus the initial stacks. So it's (1,36 * 5)=6,8 seconds intial, plus 353/(25 + 1,36)=13,4 average scorches to be cast, which multiplicated by 1,36, is 18,2 seconds. Adding the 6,8 initial seconds is 25 seconds scorching total. 25 * 1480 = 37000.<br>
Now let's say you can go fireballing for the whole time. We then multiplicate these "scorch seconds" for fireball DPS. 25 * 2018 = 50450<br>
50450-37000=13450 damage difference.<br>
13450/360, which is the fight duration, gives 37 DPS. <br>
<br>
Let's take a group with 2 destrolocks, our firemage and an elemental shaman. We want to decide what's best between a second firemage and a moonkin.<br>
By plugging in the same data as before, results give me 2273 DPS (notice i didn't include a SP). A second firemage fully supported by the first (not needing to cast scorch) would then deal 2273 + 37 = 2310 DPS.<br>
I have to admit my knowledge of moonkins is not the highest. However, by playing with Rawr i found out they can deal at least 1929 DPS. Moonkin aura with the right Idol adds 100ish DPS to the firemage, 120ish to the warlocks, and another 100ish to the shaman. 100 + 120 + 120 + 100 + 1929 = 2369 DPS.<br>
It's a net increase of 59 DPS, with the addition of Insect Swarm.<br>
<br>

		<div id="post_message_735747"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Moonkins are in that odd position where:<br>
<br>
1) They're almost extinct.<br>
2) The ones that did persevere through the adversity of pre-badge loot are extremely driven.<br>
3) Due to the above two facts are cherished by the guilds that have them and sneered upon by the guilds that don't.<br>
<br>
While it's very feasible to compare your Nth warlock to your Xth mage because by and large every guild will have at least one more who isn't in the raid of either, it's hard to compare anything to a moonkin given that by and large, guilds either have them and employ them regularly or don't even want to think about them and roll their eyes at the notion.<br>
<br>
You also made two rather odd flaws in your calculation:<br>
<br>
Firstly, you assume some dps increase to every class you assign a moonkin to. It is rather silly, at this raid level, to put a mage, two locks, a moonkin and an e-shaman grouped <i>with no Shadowpriest on Brutallus</i>. I will very happily stick my hand in the fire and claim the best-case scenario loss of -100dps from losing the mage (probably more because he'll also lose ToW), +40dps from buffing the SP who will take his place, netting a grand "approximately the same as not bringing the moonkin at all" Plus Insect Swarm. Which is rather questionable, given debuff slot availability, though YMMV. I am aware most guilds don't bother even with Scorpid Sting due to debuff slots, which is 2.5x better than Swarm and doesn't require a moonkin.<br>
<br>
Secondly, though I feel rather dry and pedantic pointing this out, your disclaimer is rather odd. "calculations are on average" thus "maths are wrong" is an inaccurate statement. I'd venture, "calculations are on average" could only result to "results are on average". Your calculating over a whole fight may be inaccurately representative of what you're debating but it certainly doesn't mean you can't compute numbers.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I definitely need to make my points clearer.<br>
You are right on everything you said. However, the core of my post was that stacking firemages won't be much more useful than the addition of each mage's dps to each other. Adding group composition and comparison with moonkin was something i thought would have made the point clearer, but in the end i recognise it was messier.<br>
<br>
However, what you said about moonkins is true. They're a good addition and it's lovely to see people without saying "omg you raid with a moonkin? LOL!!"<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

RoS phase 2 was worse for pushbacks but I concede the point.  All I was pointing out was that M'uru wasn't necessarily the deathrattle for Arc/Frost that your post seemed to make it out to be.  <br>
<br>
I'm really enjoying the difference in play style and that my personal play actually determines where I fall on the meters as opposed to it being purely based on the RNG and how often it determines that my Fireball will crit.  I really hope that I am able to make Arc/Frost work well enough to not be a liability on M'uru.  <br>

</div>It's a question of degree.  Each spec is dependent on RNG but there is a very simple statistical principal in that the more examples you get, the more likely for them to show relevance or the less likely it is for the sample to be outside the range of expected results.<br>
<br>
Brutallus Fight.<br>
<br>
Fire mage casts 130-140 Fireballs.  An Arc/Frost mage casts 55-60 Frostbolts and 150-160 Arcane Blasts or 57% more spells then that Fire mage.  <br>
<br>
On top of that sample size discrepancy there is the fact that when Arc/Frost blows all it's cooldowns it is using a spell that can only crit for 175% of normal so having a lower percentage of spell crits occur during that small segment of time hurts but is not as significant as for Fire where each crit is 210%.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_736665"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Just a few replies, my point about IV and AB damage is that AB operates on a damage compression component, it will hurt your DPS if it drops off during IV, but I forgot to mention coldsnap+IV.<br>
<br>
Assuming you squeeze all you can out of IV it compensates for a drop off else where.<br>
<br>
 AB drop off only significantly affect DPS if<br>
1: Your haven't dumped enough mana and a pot timer comes up forcing you to not put pot on cooldown<br>
2: AB falls off during AP/IV<br>
3: The boss dies before you reach zero mana<br>
<br>
  My point about AB drop off-vs-DPS s that AB drops off due to stop spell casting. Stop casting by and large, will affect any casters DPS.<br>
<br>
  I made a point about gear and someone made a counter point that in Sunwell Arcane and Fire, as well as DPS in general compete for the same gear, just looking at robes<br>

		<div id="post_message_737017"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Well, after a bit of boredom, i decided to test the "rolling ignite" phenom again with patch 2.4<br>
<br>
Results:<br>
2.0 speed fireballs: To fast, No rolls<br>
2.05 speed: " "<br>
2.09 speed: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080510124625/http://gfx.nihilum.mousesports.com/albums/52455/2110/8321.JPG" target="_blank">http://gfx.nihilum.mousesports.com/a.../2110/8321.JPG</a><br>
2.19 speed: No rolls<br>
<br>
So let's take a look at the one that did work, i underlined the important parts.<br>
<br>
Breakdown:<br>
Total crit damage: 1256 + 1294 + 4419 + 4435 + 3964 + 4203 + 3691 = 23262<br>
23262 * .4 = 9304.8 expected ignite damage<br>
Total ignite damage: 510 + 510 + 884 + 1771 + 1678 + 1678 + 1680 + 1680 + 1578 + 1578 = 13547<br>
<br>
Ignite did: 58.2% instead of the expected 40%<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<u>&gt; What does this mean? &lt;</u><br>
<br>
Well, let's imagine for a second your ignites always rolled like this, the question thus becomes <i>is it worth it?</i><br>
<br>
So, i'll attempt to answer it with this example of our very own Manly's "record" brutallus dps of 2445. <br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080510124625/http://wowwebstats.com/1n2o3d3sufrjc?s=9501-9840&amp;m" target="_blank">Wow Web Stats</a><br>
If his ignite did 58.2% instead of the expected 40%, he would have done 65,596 extra damage, or 2645 dps.<br>
<br>
That's 200 dps more on an attempt he got 42% crit just because he could('ve) roll(ed) his own ignites.<br>
<br>
Or in Layman's terms, 8.17% dps more with a 42% crit rate just if ignites roll.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<u>Discussion</u><br>
Q: Is a perfect hasted set really viable?<br>
A: Maybe. personal tests indicate you have to get your fireball to within a .01 second, or ~10-15 haste at that level. This means if you get heroism, if you get drums (or depend on it and lose it), etc. any time not spent during that perfect range and you've lost your rolling ignite. Any pushback and you've lost your rolling ignite (although conc aura and icy veins negate it). Can be touchy.<br>
<br>
Q: What if i just want to roll ignites during cooldowns?<br>
A: This, suprisingly, is very possible. All you have to do if you can't reach the correct amount of base haste (640 was it?), you just have to have around ~313 haste when you pop icy veins, or ~138 haste base on your gear and pop skull of gul'dan.<br>
<br>
OR<br>
<br>
Get ~233 haste base on your gear, pop icy veins and drums, and you're also back in rolling range.<br>
That said if you only roll it some of the time you only get that much extra % of rolling ignite respectively<br>
<br>
In conclusion if you aim for ignite range you're getting 4-10% or so extra damage, this does however not take into consideration the fact that crit gets exponentially better as you stack it (though quite slowly... however theorertically at 100% crit your ignites stack into infinity). Something to chew on.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>This is wrong. Clear casting channeled spells does NOT trigger the 5-second-rule. However, you cannot under the current game mechanics get "normal" (out of FSR) mana regeneration while channeling a spell with a base mana cost. That applies to arcane missiles as it does to blizzard or mind control, but it's not directly obvious for arcane missiles as the 5s cast time coincides with the 5s you have to spend without casting to get full out of FSR regeneration again.<br>
<br>
If you cast clearcasted arcane missiles, you are <b>out</b> of the FSR, but you gain only "combat" mana regeneration because you are currently channeling. If you cancel your clearcasted arcane missiles after 0.1s of channeling, your next tick will be full out of FSR mana regeneration. If your clearcasted arcane missiles for example last only 2.5s due to haste, you will also gain full out of FSR mana regeneration while casting your next spell (e.g. frostbolt), if it is not a channeling spell like AM or Blizzard again.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Your results match almost exactly mines. I assume that using fireballs has no real impact on the results, but typically for pure testing reasons I try and avoid them. In my testing I found the window seemed to be roughly 2.07-2.11 for it to work. You can get it to roll outside of those values, but it was fairly inconsistent. <br>
<br>
I was thinking about this, maybe the implied delay for adding debuffs also applies for <i>removing</i> debuffs. It would explain the combustion-&gt;flamestrike-&gt;blastwave behavior amongst other things. It could probably have some potentially unthinked uses if that turns out to be true. However, I am unsure how to test it. I wonder if doing combustion (stack to 10, with 1 charge left), then scorch/fireblast, and see if both spells are 100% crit ? Or maybe the test is very flawed because possibly combustion is wonky and doesn't gets removed until the ignite gets applied (ie: it will be affected by the ignite application delay, which would affect indirectly debuff removal in this case).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

So let's take a look at the one that did work, i underlined the important parts.<br>
<br>
Breakdown:<br>
Total crit damage: 1256 + 1294 + 4419 + 4435 + 3964 + 4203 + 3691 = 23262<br>
23262 * .4 = 9304.8 expected ignite damage<br>
Total ignite damage: 510 + 510 + 884 + 1771 + 1678 + 1678 + 1680 + 1680 + 1578 + 1578 = 13547<br>
<br>
Ignite did: 58.2% instead of the expected 40%<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<u>&gt; What does this mean? &lt;</u><br>
<br>
Well, let's imagine for a second your ignites always rolled like this, the question thus becomes <i>is it worth it?</i><br>
<br>
So, i'll attempt to answer it with this example of our very own Manly's "record" brutallus dps of 2445. <br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080510124625/http://wowwebstats.com/1n2o3d3sufrjc?s=9501-9840&amp;m" target="_blank">Wow Web Stats</a><br>
If his ignite did 58.2% instead of the expected 40%, he would have done 65,596 extra damage, or 2645 dps.<br>
<br>
That's 200 dps more on an attempt he got 42% crit just because he could('ve) roll(ed) his own ignites.<br>
<br>
Or in Layman's terms, 8.17% dps more with a 42% crit rate just if ignites roll.<br></div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Except that it's not 200 more dps, I'm sure that even with his 42% crit rate there were crits that occured in isolation that would only give up a 40% ignite tick and not have any sort of rolling type behavior.  You are taking a behavior that occurs in isolated instances and attempting to apply it universally to the entirety of that parse.  <br>
<br>
On top of that, based on the rest of your findings rolling ignites is a very fickle mechanic.  Since it only rolls at exactly 2.09s you really are only getting the rolls to occur when Icy Veins and Bloodlust and the Skull is active (so 20 seconds of rolling behavior out of a ~360 second parse) or if you set up with enough haste gear to get them rolling with just Icy Veins + Skull then you have to plan on not having them roll during Bloodlust since your Fireball will drop out of the ideal zone and will be too fast to cause the rolls.  In any case you would only be rolling for 20 seconds during that 6 minute encounter which means you would get 9 Fireballs that could potentially roll not the 123 that Manly cast during that encounter.<br>
<br>
<br>
Edited to add: I don't want to seem like I am trying to pull the rug out from under people or that I am opposed to ignites rolling, I just don't want anyone posting inflated numbers about the effectiveness of the mechanic.  I've been here since the last time mages were thought of as being overpowered (Nax and the huge rolling ignites) and after suffering through the coefficient nerf and everything else that resulted from that the last thing I want the developers to do is to get it in their head that mages are outputting an excessive amount of dps.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>You missed the part where 2.09s fireballs are possible without any cooldowns. So under the vast majority of the fight (ie: when not using skull or icy veins or bloodlust) this would be possible.<br>

target: 684 haste (2.09s fireballs) - 436 haste (base set not counting gems) = 248 haste left to be gained somewhere<br>
To get ~248 haste, we have 2 choices:<br>
<br>
1- pure haste gems in all Y sockets and RY gem in R sockets (+100 haste), in addition to using a permanent drum rotation, and shroud of the highborne. It is still slightly behind in terms of needed haste, but enough for our purposes. This is somewhat impractical to require permanent drum rotation, but the option is there.<br>
<br>
2- use the gladiator MH and gem RY in Y sockets (as I would have had done normally anyway). Drums <i>will</i> possibly mess up the timing, so we have 2 options to work around that;<br>
<br>
2.1- not using drums (...) <br>
2.2- run on the 'low-side' of haste, then make drums make you go slightly over the 248 target. 208 'normal' extra haste from base setup, which drums make you jump to 288 extra haste, both of which are OK. This is notably easy to do by dropping gloves of tyri's power for sunfire gloves.<br>
2.3- use only drums in conjunction with your other cooldowns (skull notably). The whole setup is not functional during skull activation anyway, so just stack them as you normally would, and accept that during that time you will get a stacking ignite rather than a rolling ignite. Please note that you could also drum -&gt; swap weapon and not really pay much of a cost for sub-optimal haste gear.<br>
<br>
-----<br>
All of those items, save for gloves of tyri's power (which really is a wash compared to sunfire gloves), in the first category are best-in-slots. <br>
<br>
Also, you need 43.54% / 684 passive haste for 2.09s fireballs.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>What to you think is going to happen when a mage posts a parse of them beating the snot out of a double-glaived rogue on a fight like Brutallus using rolling ignites?  Cause now that you have shown that the technique is valid and the dps gain is credible it is now a certainty that it will happen. <br>
<br>
Arcane Missile haste stacking with the MQG at least had some probability of being a valid technique simply due to the changes Blizzard had implemented that patch that made it actually work and the fact that the changes had made it through the PTR with mages showing that it worked and talking about it and the changes still being implemented.  <br>
<br>
This is a bit different.  Plain and simple it's exploiting a loophole in the caster mechanics.  This is especially evident in light of the small cast time window that makes it work in the first place.  It's an interesting intellectual exercise but once you get it functioning on a normal basis (which you just showed that it can and will be done) don't be surprised when you get Fire mages nerfed to the same degree as what happened to Rogues and haste stacking with the Warglaives not too long ago. <br>
<br>
What I would be most worried about is how they will close the loophole.  Easiest fix would seem to be simply removing the stacking component of ignite completely. Sure that will screw over Firemage dps in PvE situations but it definitely seems easier to do (and less disruptive to the game as a whole) then to sit down and try to rework the whole casting mechanic so that it functions well enough to prevent the loophole in the first place.<br>
<br>
The alternative theory would be that having ignites roll when cast from 2.09s fireballs was something put into the game by the developers intentionally......<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>There's a big difference between the 2.2 AM abuse and rolling ignites.  In order to get to a high enough passive haste level without jeopardizing your +spell damage and other stats, you basically need Sunwell level gear and *probably* a 2050 arena rating.  The number of mages who have access to these gear requirements will constitute a small minority of the populace.  The issue with the Arcane mage in 2.2 was that every mage with a meta-gem slot could do it; a larger proportion of the community was abusing it.  Additionally, there is still an RNG factor with the rolling ignites (depending on when your crits occur). Even if a mage does beat the crap out of a double-warglaived rogue, it won't happen frequently.  Finally, as you've mentioned in your post, it's going to be hard for Blizzard to close the loophole unless they change how their servers register spell hits/debuffs, or they nerf the crap out of ignite.  I doubt they'll do the later, as that will effect the mage community more than a handful of mages posting rogue-like numbers on brutallus.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_737686"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->So I'm not terribly familiar with all the rolling ignite "mechanics" (or bug, whatever you want to call it) but I have been trying to keep up with this thread, and read most of the other thread.  I have had another thought that I don't think I've see mentioned.<br>
<br>
From what I understand, everyone is doing base calculations for getting the rolling effects off the first ignite tick.  I think I saw somewhere a screenshot of someone actually getting a rolling ignite off the *second* ignite tick.  If this is true, is there any kind of reliable way to get that to repeat?  As I see it here is a possible scenario:<br>
<br>
Assumptions: <br>
-It takes ~1s for ignite debuff to appear, then ticks in 2s intergrals.  So first ignite is at 3s, second is at 5s (numbers can be adjusted for more accurate numbers, I just don't remember if we ever came up with a set number for the delay)<br>
-The ~2.1s cast fireballs work for rolling ignites because of the delay + travel time of fireball and causes consecutive crits to be almost on top of ignite ticks.<br>
<br>
Goal: Crit fireball (2 ignite ticks + noncrit fireball) Crit fireball + rolling ignite<br>
<br>
So basically, we want our second crit to land at the time of the second ignite tick.  With 2.1s fireballs, I don't believe it will roll on the second tick because there is a flat 2s between ticks, aka no delay.  I would assume then you need a longer cast time on your fireballs, somewhere in the vicinity of 2.3-2.4s maybe?<br>
<br>
<br>
Again, this is based off the assumption that you can roll ignites off the second tick as well.  So if I am wrong you can just ignore me as some crazy guy rambling.  And of course it works on every-other fireball crits, not consecutive crits.  I would think this would be doable with gear available now, but I have all of 5 spell haste right now since I haven't been raiding in quite awhile (I could check and see if I have my trusty mqg somewhere, but even then i'm not sure if i could test it).  <br>

		<div id="post_message_737695"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The simpliest fix is to remove ignite dot and apply it directly as part of fireball. I'm sure everyone would highly rejoice of the change. Although you would want to make it explicit that the talent 'ignite' gives 210% crit rates total, which would be quite awkward to word out.<br>
<br>
I would be extremely happy if my fireballs critted directly for 210%. It would have other small ramifications elsewhere, such as CSD, but overall I don't even think it would be a negative change. I don't think it would change much on the pvp front, except maybe giving arcane/fire too much burst ? To be honest I think its a wash but thats just me. I can't find any compelling reason to keep ignite the way it is -- all it does is induce frustration.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Without delving into repeating the stuff over, you can roll ignites on both the first and last tick. Travel time is mostly inconsequential, particularly given the standard assumption that both you and the boss doesn't move. It does comes into play when you scorch/fireblast but besides that the impact of it is rather minor.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Manly, 210% without any DoT being involved won't happen since the reason it is 210% is to offset the delay in having the damage applied and the chance that the ignite tick won't occur due to the thing dying or it being dispelled.  They would most likely just make a bigger ignite tick overwrite a smaller one and then refresh the debuff with no stacking being involved.  Sure it would hurt Firemage PvE dps but most likely wouldn't bring it down far enough for it to be considered subpar in relation to other classes and then they address the issue in some way shape or form in WoLK to make Fire work again as a spec.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>What you say is highly debatable. That it has a higher than 200% crit rate counter-balanced by the fact it is delayed damage I can understand, but as far as PVE is concerned it is irrelevant. Or in other words, that 'downside' doesn't apply much in a PVE context (since bosses dispelling dots is v rare -- inexistant?). The other outstanding possible issue would be PVP, for which I don't really care at all about, but if I had to make a guess, fire is in dire need of help in PVP. I don't think that would change PVP - if at all - that players would not be able to dispell the ignite dot. If you want to argue for it, go ahead, but I am confident we both know that either side of the coin is very debatable. I could easily cite example of other classes that deal 200% crits with no delayed damage attached. And I know you would say that fire mages don't deserve 210% but rather 200% to match most of the other classes. <br>

		<div id="post_message_737762"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->So, I hate to be the guy that asks the fantastically stupid question, but I am new to the mage game and am intrigued but somewhat confused by the present rolling ignite discussion. I am not sure I have a full grip on _specifically_ what is meant by rolling an ignite, and hope that my question may have at least some merit in bringing others up to speed as well on what seems to be a relatively obscure mechanic. <br>
<br>
How I gather blizzard intends ignite to work: Fireball 1 crits triggering the ignite dot. Then FB 2 crits. The tick damage from 1 and 2 is added until there has been enough ticks that the ignite from FB 1 would have expired, then ignite ticks out at the damage based just on FB 2. If this is wrong then I have been operating on incorrect assumptions from the start and am making an even bigger fool of myself than I was hoping for. <br>
<br>
Now, Rolling ignites? Am I to understand that landing a FB at just the right moment can be beneficial how: causing the damage component of the first crit from not dropping off the ignite, causing the ignite damage to be calculated wrong (based on the FB damage and the simultaneous ignite tick?), triggering more ignite ticks than should occur somehow, or what? <br>
<br>
Again I apologize for what must be an annoyingly elementary question for most of you. But there has been so much discussion of rolling ignites that searching the term gave me pages and pages of posts that all were discussing the topic, but without explaining the underlying assumptions. And I would very much like to be able to follow the current discussion.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_737798"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->An Ignite debuff is supposed to do, lets say, X damage (where X is 40% of what the crit fireball hit for). It's expected to tick twice, so has 2 ticks for X/2.<br>
<br>
Then suppose that another fireball crits after the first one has ticked once. That one is supposed to do Y damage (where Y is 40% of what the 2nd crit fireball hit for). But there's already an ignite on the target, with X/2 damage remaining on it. So, that X/2 damage is added to the new ignite, which replaces the old one. So the X ignite is dropped, and a new ignite is applied, which does Y+X/2 damage total, or rather Y/2+X/4 per tick. In the end, a total of X+Y damage is done, which is what is intended.<br>
<br>
That's what's supposed to happen, anyway. Rolling Ignites is when we use a bug to roll more of the previous ignite into the next one than is intended. For example, if we hit fireball Y right as ignite X is about to have its first tick, it thinks that no ticks have happened yet, so adds the full damage of ignite X into ignite Y, then X ticks, then Y is applied. That results in a total damage done of 3X/2+Y damage done, ie an extra X/2.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I completely disagree with this - somehow warlocks are balanced with 200% instantaneous crits along with a 20% bonus from Improved Shadow Bolt, this gives them 240% crits on subsequent crits, and no one is complaining that Warlocks do overpowered burst damage in pvp.<br>
<br>
I would argue that the reason ignite is 210% helps to make Fire Mage crit benefit somewhat more comparable to Warlocks, if you just removed it and made it 200% straight up, that would simply be worse in every way, which makes no sense.<br>
<br>
It seems to me that you could re-implement Ignite as an instantaneous seperate-damage proc and it would not be especially unbalanced. It isn't like Fire Mages are tearing up the pvp statistics in the first place, this change would make their burst damage a little scarier, but so what?

</div>Well, technically you could argue up to a point that if ISB was already up that it remained 200% crit multiplier all along. I don't think we can draw any direct parallels comparing classes. I think that, arcane/fire aside, PVP would be fine would the ignite damage not be delayed but integral part of the damage. With this said, I do agree that arcane/fire has some burst potential that would be indeed quite absurd. <br>
<br>
However, you could also make combustion turn the 'old ignite' into a direct damage component, which would make arcane/fire unaffected. In other words, without combustion you get the old style ignite, with combustion all your crits will do the damage directly.<br>
<br>
As for other real 'solutions' to fix this issue, I am totally unsure. Moving down to one tick would not remove the bug (just make it harder to reproduce, but give twice the efficiency).<br>
<br>

</div>How about making Ignite 175%(+spell power becomes 200, vs 225% for frost) and then making Empowered Fireball add 7% per rank for a final 210% crit multiplier if you go fully into Fire.<br>
<br>
That solves the problem, gives deep fire a boost in pvp for burst damage, and leaves arcane/fire about the same - it gains a very small amount of burst(200% crits from 175%), but loses the ignite dot damage completely. Given that it currently is not the dominant pvp spec, that seems reasonable, and deep fire could absolutely use the increased burst damage since it lacks AP and PoM Pyro, and Combustion is terrible in pvp.<br>
<br>
The nicest thing about this solution is it's all accomplished with existing code, no new code would need to be written to just alter our crit modifier with two separate talents, and the entire mess that Ignite is goes away.<br>
<br>
I would in fact, go so far as to argue that it might be fair to drop Ignite down to 3 talent points this way, freeing up 2 points for utility/pvp talents in normal pve builds, which would be handy.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">The only reason you saw it tick off the second ignite tick vs the first one was because the fireball on the first ignite didn't crit.  Ignite ticks in 2s intervals after it's been applied, so if I would have waited for the second ignite dot PURPOSELY to try and get rolling ignite effect, I would have completely missed 1 fireball's worth of damage.  In order to get it to go only off the second ignite, you'd have to be at 2.09s fireball+2s to get it on the second rather than the first, which is a significant dps loss as well as pointless.</div>

</div>If i understand correctly, 2.09 sec casting speed fireball triggers rolling ignite on consecutive crits. If we are aiming for 2nd ignite tick, we may want to reduce the casttime of fireball further, so that 1st fireball hits at, say, 2.045 second mark, and second hits at 4.09 second mark. If first doesn't crit, and second does, we get a roll on 2nd ignite tick.<br>
<br>
Wonder if doing it this way would constitute a dps improvement. We get less chances to lose an ignite stack, but also less chances to actually roll ignite (requires crit-miss-crit sequence, which is less likely to appear than just crit-crit). Also we get to stack even more haste in situation where +damage is more effective stat for basic gearing.<br>
<br>
Wonder if there is a window of haste that allows ignites to roll on both fireballs.<br>
Also wonder how latency factores in all that precise cast-speed fine-tuning.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_738330"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Two things:<br>
<br>
<b>New Mages: </b>There is a whole thread which explains how rolling ignite works, please don't derail with "I've read all the threads, but how does it work?". Amusingly, the thread has the words "ROLLING IGNITE" in the title. if you can't even manage to find that in the haze of threads, for your viewing pleasure: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080511043538/http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t19766-mage_rolling_ignites_they_back/" target="_blank">[Mage] Rolling Ignites: are they back?</a> . Maxi, you're planning on delaying a 3sec cast to cast as a 4.09, with the intention of getting a free 50% of the crit's 40% added to your ignite. If they both crit. In exchange for delaying your normal spam 35%. Well the statistics don't look particularly promissing to be honest. You'd quite possibly make more dps spamming Fball without speccing ignite at all than sitting around for 1.04sec every fireball.<br>
<br>
<b>Ignite Frontloading:</b> Gentlemen, we are arguing what is a moot point. Rounced, you're stuck in 2004 going omg-pom-pyro-lol. That spec died a timely death, first with trinks not stacking, then stamina increase, then resilience, and then resilience-DOT fire double-dipping. Your crit will get it's size reduced from resilience and hence do a smaller Ignite, which in turn is a DOT and will then get it's size reduced from resilience. Ignite has had it's anus reamed by PvP since Arena became serious with a Black&amp;Decker. Not to mention, it's been a long, long time since mages have been core damage dealers in PvP. You are probably aware that life-pools have more than doubled yet manapools have barely increased by 25%. Last I checked Damage was the secondary (though useful and bursty, in frost's case) function of mages. Even if you were planning to focus on damage dealing it's extremely unlikely any spec could manage to do it better than frost can. -25% crit from Res is hard to counter with talents worth +16%crit (highest crit scenario, as 33/28/0) compared to 5% from emp FrBolt, an eventual 10% from Winter's and 50% from shatter.<br>
<br>
Neither does front-loading ignites mean anything at all. You can achieve, as others stated, much bigger crits with arcane/frost and arguably much more useful too via nova-silence-(AP-Fbolt-POM-Fbolt)-Fireblast-Coldsnap-Nova-Icelance, even gaining the chance of critting the blast via a frosbite. PoM-LoL is only useful in world-pvp videos where some skilled mage picks on a useless gnome mage (Why is it always the gnomes?) who then hurls a monstrous pyro into his ice-block and watches as all his CDs tick away versus an immune foe who then eats his face off.<br>
<br>
However, the peculiarities of PvP are neither privy nor relevant to this thread. Fact remains Ignite is broken and problematic:<br>
<br>
1) Mob death costs us much in terms of actual output. "if it'd live'd I'd have done more" doesn't cut it.<br>
2) It can clearly miss-function, costing DPS with ignite over-writing<br>
3) It can again miss-function adding DPS via rolling, requiring us to jump through hoops to perform stupid parlor tricks like getting "exactly" an amount of haste, which plus or minus 10 points will cause a steep damage drop.<br>
4) Fball travels as fast as a dead mule, crits, applies ignite, boss phase-changes and gets a warm 1250 tick in his face. Dead mage, or stop casting 8.5sec before change? Lame.<br>
5) It's another debuff slot. No comment on Fball DoT.<br>
<br>
However: Ignite is an interesting mechanic in that it's unique and jovial, makes "sense" with fire setting as it were, fire to the target and can possibly herald new mechanics for us in the future.<br>
<br>
What I foresee, is a mage-version of Conflagrate which will chew up all remaining ignites and DoTs and frontolad them plus some. This will also sort-out our phase-change-agro issue. Frontolading it is not creative enough and makes it too samey.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The Fireball-Scorch variation is unlikely to help much.  50% of casts are scorch which is probably costing a little over 10% of your dps compared to a more typical 8 Fireball/1 Scorch mix (with a very small improvement in dpm, but nothing to write home about).  Then, as you point out, the crit-miss-crit sequence is much less likely that crit-crit:<br>
<br>
Crit rate, crit-crit chance, crit-miss-crit chance<br>
10%, 1.0%, 0.9%<br>
20%, 4.0%, 3.2%<br>
30%, 9.0%, 6.3%<br>
40%, 16.0%, 9.6%<br>
50%, 25.0%, 12.5%<br>
60%, 36.0%, 14.4%<br>
70%, 49.0%, 14.7%<br>
80%, 64.0%, 12.8%<br>
90%, 81.0%, 8.1%<br>
100%, 100%, 0%<br>
<br>
The size of the rolls will keep improving with higher crit either way so the optimum for the crit-miss-crit case is probably about 70%.<br>
<br>
The only case in which I can imagine this helping is with an unrealistic combination of low spell damage (no more than 500-ish so scorch dps is close to fireball dps), high crit (50% or more), and moderate haste (10%).  There may be a more realistic range where the dps loss is small and there is a dpm improvement, but I doubt it will be applicable to many (if any) mages.<br>
<br>
EDIT:<br>
Thinking about Fireball-Scorch alternation, I was missing the obvious.  If you can run with 132 haste, and alternate Fireball and Scorch, and with travel times of 0.7 sec (fireball) and 0.0 sec (scorch) then spells will *land* consistently 2.09 apart.  This is much more favorable than the idea I orginally posted.  You still have to overcome the dsp loss from using scorch half the time, but you get to take advantage of every consecutive crit-crit.  With a sufficient crit level - probably starting in the mid 40s or low 50s - the rolling ignites could cause this could beat fireball spam even with high spell damage.  I'll do some testing, though I don't have the gear for a really high crit rate.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

There is an elasticity allowed in your cast time in order to get a rolling ignites. It doesn't have to be precisely 2.09s.

</div>Personally I liked Lhivera's idea the best for that, which was to give Firemages an instant cast spell that would only work on a target with an ignite stack, that would eat the remaining ignite damage and then reapply it as a 12 second DoT to the target (with the DoT being affected again by the mages +damage) and at the same time refreshing the Scorch debuff.  <br>
<br>
As for me being offbase about the PoM Pyro thing, Frostbolt with spell power and shards does 225% crits and has a much lower base damage range then Fireball or Pyroblast as well as a much lower spell damage coefficient and if the ignite was frontloaded when combined with spellpower it would give 235% crits.  For a mage with 1400 spell damage that means an APed pyroblast would crit for 7871.5 and could be followed by a 4119.7 Fireblast or 11991.2 damage in 1.5 seconds.  Since Pyro has a travel time the spells could be started at range with the target eating both before they even knew they were being attacked and without even having a chance to Ice Block before being destroyed.  At least with the shatter combos you get a little bit of warning that they are coming (being rooted by a nova kinda says TRINKET or ICE BLOCK NOW very loudly).

Arcane Blast through most of the proc, at the last second cast Arcane Missles. Now you have hasted yourself for 9 seconds of casting. at 320 haste, AM starts to become competitive. Now if you do the same with<br>

<br>
You can keep up a spell hasting effect of 300 for about 25 seconds given you are Arcane Blasting at proc time and then AM just before it falls off, also given that all 3 proc at different intervals (doable via weapon swapping). For weapon swapping I would put Spellsurge on Blade Wizardry and you are basically going for a double proc on one weapon.<br>

<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32488" target="_blank">[Ashtongue Talisman of Insight]</a><br>
You can also do the same thing, keep the buff up an extra 4-5 seconds by AMing just as it drops.<br>
<br>
Added to that<br>

<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29305" target="_blank">[Band of the Eternal Sage]</a><br>
and you begin to form a proc based build, where one proc has synergy with another, hasting will squeeze more out of a damage proc.<br>
<br>
In addition there is the clearcast factor, which is basicly a Crit proc.<br>
<br>
<br>
There are ways to go with this. If just two hasting effects proc together, 600 hasted AM can out preform AB. You have a good chance of procing hasting when you need to evocate, you can get 2 AMs casted before your AB buff falls. Even just at 320 haste doing what I said above, all you do is after AM, switch to AB/Frostbolt as normal. Other possibilities include nocking yourself out of 5 second rule via AM (4.5 second AM + 2.5 second Frostbolt).<br>
<br>
Best case scenarios?<br>
1000+ hasted AM while clearcasting during IV/Arcane Power. Much like a slot machine, some times you roll cherries and some times you hit the jackpot. BY THE WAY, you thing IV/AP is bull in Hyjal? You haven't seen a 1000+hasted mage spamming down-ranked AE and still blowing the crap out of SOD.<br>
<br>
If the idea takes interest I'd like to divulge further.<br>

		<div id="post_message_739457"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Ok so I was mistaken a little bit, it would require more haste to aim for the second ignite tick and the crit-noncrit-crit sequence.  However from the mention of the scorch-fireball sequence I think I might have come up with an idea to get rolling ignites with low haste.  Maybe not that reliably, but I would think it would work.  I also went back in this thread and found the combat log for the rolling ignite off the second tick, it was from a post by wadi on page 13, but here it is again:<br>
<br>
05:08'54.869 Arcanis's Fireball crits Dr. Boom for 4855 Fire damage<br>
<br>
05:08'54.869 Arcanis's Fireball crits Dr. Boom for 4855 Fire damage<br>
05:08'56.838 Arcanis's Fireball dots Dr. Boom for 27 Fire damage<br>
05:08'56.916 Arcanis's Fireball hits Dr. Boom for 3002 Fire damage<br>
05:08'57.041 Arcanis's Ignite dots Dr. Boom for 971 Fire damage<br>
05:08'58.916 Arcanis's Fireball dots Dr. Boom for 24 Fire damage<br>
05:08'58.994 Arcanis's Fireball crits Dr. Boom for 5073 Fire damage<br>
05:08'59.025 Arcanis's Ignite dots Dr. Boom for 971 Fire damage<br>
05:09'00.994 Arcanis's Fireball dots Dr. Boom for 24 Fire damage<br>
05:09'01.088 Arcanis's Ignite dots Dr. Boom for 1501 Fire damage<br>
05:09'03.056 Arcanis's Fireball dots Dr. Boom for 24 Fire damage<br>
05:09'03.088 Arcanis's Ignite dots Dr. Boom for 1500 Fire damage<br>
<br>
Now lets look at the time between the original crit and the second crit that caused the rolling ignite.<br>
<br>
58.994-54.869 = 4.125s<br>
<br>
If we have 143 haste rating, this should bring our fireball cast speed to 2.75s and scorch to 1.375s roughly.  So one fireball and one scorch will take 2.75s+1.375s=4.125s.  Now as far as casting sequence, you would just fireball spam until you see a crit.  When you see the crit you will be in the middle of another fireball cast, when that one releases, cast a scorch instead of another fireball.  That will cause the scorch to land at the time needed for a rolling ignite off the second tick.<br>
<br>
The good:<br>
-you don't do a strict fireball-scorch-fireball-scorch rotation, you only have to do the scorch when you see a fireball crit<br>
<br>
The bad:<br>
-if the fireball before the scorch crits, no rolling ignite<br>
-I don't think you could get enough rolling ignites to offset the dps loss from not spamming fireball<br>
<br>
<br>
Alternate idea:<br>
Perhaps instead of doing on every fireball crit, look for a crit-crit to roll the ignite on.  If my head is still clear at this hour, you should get a higher "extra" tick from rolling that ignite than from a single ignite.  Of course that still relies on a crit-crit-noncrit(fireball)-crit (scorch) sequence, and i have no idea of calculating those probabilities.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>First of all, you have to drop coldsnap to do the empowered arcane missiles build. Second thing is the GCD capping at 1s, which is approached relatively quickly with arcane blast (especially inside cooldowns).  Also, keep in mind that the extra haste on the AM extending the proc is only for the portion of it that would not otherwise be overlapped by frostbolt doing the same thing at a better DPM.<br>
<br>
There are some other things like blade of wizardry being VERY suboptimal compared to an end game weapon as well as quags (assuming your alternatives are ZA trink / blessing / skull).  The crit aspect of clearcasting is also non-viable as you would have to stop an AB to cast the AM and that's highly un-optimized.<br>
<br>
+Damage procs apply to spellhit, not spellcast like haste so those are out of the picture.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>You are of course referring to SoC as there is no SoD, and even without a bajillion haste you can "blow the crap" out of it, however, I remain sceptical at "why the hell bother".<br>
<br>
Firstly, you are again at the AoE cap. 1k haste is 63% haste, and you can not go below 1sec on an instant. I understand AToI on aoe, as it's perma-up but Quag's? So you get one proc over the whole aoe phase and cast 0.7AE more than you would've otherwise? Even if it procs you only gain 60% of an AE per 6sec of Quag's activation and that's not even discounting the 1.5sec you'll lose because it'll proc and then your GCD will be clocking.<br>
<br>
I'd much rather have an SCB equipped in case some bozo AoEer decides he'll agro everything outside the Consecration and leaves me extra work to do; the mana difference is appreciated much: it's an extra AE.<br>
<br>
Ultimately my boggle boils down to why are you bothering swapping gear around and weapon-swapping and designing optimal gear and... For trash. I understand swapping off some hit for more crit, or a few gimmick trinks or something, but so much work on something which is only fundamentally critical in MH and even then a very risky business when there's Abominations in the pack seems quite futile. You even said yourself you're down-ranking. If you're gearing everything to make your AE huge why are you doing the one thing that makes it smaller? And don't say "agro" because if you have an agro problem you either have a Protadin problem or, as I suspect, you're going overboard on the AOE DPS for e-peen reasons (because it clearly isn't critical to the raid, unless you have too few AoEers). Or both.<br>
<br>
Edit to add to Etherialz: While AM-arcane has it's time and place and is in fact not as sub-optimal as many think compared to 40-0-21, E is correct in that irrespective of spec/gear there is no concievable scenario where AB can outperform FrBolt. The reason AM-arcane works has nothing at all to do with AM being anything better than shit, because it isn't. And Clearcasting AM is only possible in an AB/AM two-spell-rotation or (AB-AM)*3/Sc rotation, which in the later case is great but in the former is quite bad because though you get a CC'd AM (lovely) you then have to spend either 9.5sec AB-ramping or 20+sec AB-AM ramping AB up, again another DPS loss which was not made up with the CC'd AM. Ultimately, I've found if CC procs? Just let it hit whatever you'd do otherwise. The only spec that was worth cancelling a cast to use a CC was 33/28/0 and even then only to go Trink-flamecap-destropot-AP-PoM-Pyro on the CC.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I don't disagree with the overall analysis, but no conceivable is a stretch too far. My normal raiding situation is CoS but no CoE with JoW on the target due to a comp of one mage, bunch of locks, and pally tank or ret pally in raid. As a result, I'm <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?talent=oixVf0cztIuioZV0bho" target="_blank">50/0/11</a> and my AM outperforms my FrB in terms of dps by a significant margin (1152 vs 822) while remaining fairly close in terms of dpm (33.5 vs 32.2). Before you complain that my FrB isn't properly talented, I ran through rawr and for my gear level (spellfire/ZA) and expected fight durations, 50/0/11 consistently outperforms 40/0/21 when I sub in available gear for both, so I talent my FrB for convenience while grinding since I never toss a FrB in raids. Shifting the talents around to boosting FrB only nets another 100 dps or so for FrB. I'll be switching over to 40/0/21 in the t6 range due to the unavoidable excess +hit on the gear pulling up FrB's performance.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I know this is the first time I've chimed into the mage thread so I'll probably be looked on as an outsider, but I've done some quick napkin math on this and I can't see how it works.  According to my quick and dirty calculations, with a 30% crit rate and assuming hit-capped, a properly talented (for 21 points in the tree, anyway) Frostbolt will still outscale fully talented Arcane Missiles based on spell damage.  Even assuming that wasn't true, Arcane Missiles is still a more expensive cast on a mana-per-second basis than Frostbolt, so from a regen perspective, it would be cheaper to throw the Frostbolts as it would get you back to spamming Arcane Blast sooner.<br>
<br>
[edit] I also checked and the scaling problem is even worse with crit.  Am I missing something?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>It all depends on your assumptions. If you assume FrB is hit capped and the two spells have a "fair" set of debuffs (both CoE and CoS) there is no way FrB is behind AM. FrB scales faster than AM with both +dam (due to the high base damage of AM) and crit (due to ice shards) and equally with haste. I base my theorycrafting on my own situation, which is CoS and JoW on target and no CoE  at the arcane hit cap. I can gear for additional +hit, but that comes at expense of stats that benefit my AB, so it doesn't boost overall dps. I did check.<br>
<br>
The JoW reduces the cost of AM an average of 2.5*74=185 mana and you get a tick of OOC regen if you're not chaining them, which I don't. I'm 600/405 for regen when raid buffed, so that's another 78 mana. This pulls the cost down to 521 mana for the AM compared to the (345*.82-(74*.5))*2= 492 mana for 2 fully talented frostbolts. Toss in a 4% miss for Frostbolt (I'm assuming phantom hit for the FrB)  and the 10% extra damage on AM and you get the unexpected result. Higher gear levels bring enough extra stats (notably +hit) to overcome the difference, and gemming for +dam instead of gemming for int/spi will move the transition point lower. <br>
<br>
As for getting back to casting AB sooner, t5 fights are short/interrupt prone enough that I spend most of my time casting AB regardless. I normally split damage 85% AB/15% AM.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>No matter what spec you are AE is much better for pure AOE damage then Flamestrike. If you're spamming Flamestrike you're wasting the ticks from the flamestrike itself as well as sometimes ignite tick. If you're going to use Flamestrike at all use it first then go in and AE spam. But IMO flamestrike is not a viable source of AOE damage.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Clearly I'd have to be brain-damaged to suggest anyone FrBolt while having a 50 arcane setup and neither did I ever advise such, however by no stretch is AM superior to the whole point of Arcane, which is AB.<br>

Whether you'll make more mana with AM over FrB due to JoW despite efficiency trade-off is a question only Rawr can answer, because weaving AM is a lot coarser than weaving FrB and also changes the dynamic substantially.<br>

<br>
Perhaps I over emphasized the AOE portion of the idea. I understand you hit gcd, but with IV you still come short of GCD, I also didn't mention that the procs would probably be back to back instead of on top of one another, also that the procs would be coold down as you have rest time between trash waves.<br>
<br>
The idea of dual procs that if you get enough haste you wouldn't need to AB and could AM instead. Your AM would do well over AB in terms of both damage and mana cost at 600 haste. If you double proc and get a below GCD AB, you will in fact loose some of the proc time from sub GCD AB, but since the procs would be stacked you could squeeze more out of them. The proc time is 6 second, ergo the more spells you cast in that timer period the more powerful the proc is. With that much haste you should be able to AM twice within the proc period, even if you cast one AB during the initial proc. Hasting can not make your prime nuke more effective mana wise, which is why +damage normally wins out. But if you can make your secondary spell do as much damage as AB while costing a lot less mana. My experience from when I did have MSD/Quag/Blade Wizardry was that all 3 procs together was rare, but two procs together happened often. Going by a rule of synergy, one proc in and of itself is weak, but two stacked together are a great deal stronger then one by itself, perhaps 3 times. 3 procs together could potentialy be 5-6 times as strong. If you got lucky and say had a 600 hasted AM for and managed to spam it 2 times, and then pulled another two AMs at 900 haste you'd do an insane amount of damage. Again this is given a luck factor, but risk vs benefits, if you can make the potential benefits out weigh the risk it's worth trying for.<br>
<br>
If I delve a little further into the science. You can throw 4 AB in 6 seconds. With a 320 spell haste proc you can do 5 ABs in almost the same time, and then throw out an AM at 4 seconds cast time. Where the benefit comes in is that you are throwing in an extra AB in the same time period (where your extra damage comes from), and the switching to AM. The AM reduced mana cost makes up for the cost of the extra AB, but with a 300 haste rating your AM comes close to AB in damage output, added to the the chance of procing another haste effect if only one had proced as of that AM. Putting you in 5SR for 2 or so seconds you make up an extra 100 or so mana in regen, thus even further compounding the cost benafits of an AM over AB. If you can pull off a free AB every minute (and loose only a smaller portion via AM), you'd come out with an extra 1500-2000 damage per minute. With say Hex Head, if you strait AB spam for 20 seconds on the use ability (given AB/IV was down), you could squeeze about 2500 damage out of it and do it once every 2 minutes. If you could only squeeze just 1500 free damage from eye of quag via 5 hasted ABs followed by 1 hasted AM, you can still do it once every minute instead of once every two minutes. Also on procs, hasting allows you to squeeze more out of other procs like say Hyjal Band. One free AB would be an extra 90ish damage, hex/icon do nothing in that regard.<br>
<br>
For clear casting, I wouldn't switch to AM just for the clearcast, it would be nice if you did clearcast. Here is the idea of the hasting procs, with 3 of them you triple your chance of lucking out on an AM/CC when you AM at proc end. Also the luck factor, if you just by sheer chance CC while AMing at 600-900 haste, you get a decent chunk of burst damage.<br>
<br>
As far as sub-optimal gear / specs. <br>
Spec wise the idea is to make AM more effective so that you don't have to be deep frost for Frostbolting. Although unlikley, if you could make AM effective enough you'd only loose Cold Snap and not Frostbolt. <br>
<br>
Gear wise one would be via weapon swapping just to obtain the proc then swapping back. If you could squeeze 1500 or more damage out of one free AB and then swap back, you can potentially come out ahead of sub Sunwell gear depending on how many ABs you had to spam to get the proc. If you lost 200 damage from a gear swap, you'd need to cast about 8 ABs outside of the proc before you started lossing out, if it proced on your 12th AB you'd not be to bad off. One is also via meta socket, so you give up 3% crit damage for a possible free AB every minute. The hasting proc has a value of 6 seconds, if you can squeeze 9-10 seconds out of that proc you double the effectiveness of it. Even looking at a blue item like Eye of Quag, can you imagine doubling the damage from any number of comparable blue items that say gave +130 damage on use? Even so I would probably switch out eye of Quag for anything Illidan/Sunwell quality, but the meta could easily be kept up to date, and I do believe if used properly Quag could be competitive with Hex Head, and certainly defeat Icon just because it procs once every minute vs every 2 minutes.<br>
<br>
Vs epic trinkets, the problem I have with say Hex or Icon is 2 min timer stacked with a 3 min AP/IV, you either need to save one or use them all seperatly. With an eye of quag you can make an attempt to line up the proc to happen once during every AP/IV and twice outside of AP/IV. My basic conept I have is something like this, you strait AB spam untill you get the procs, then you switch to your mana efficient spam during cooldown for say 30 seconds. Come time for the proc you start your AB spam again. With a 45seond internal CD on certain items, you could get in theory 3 procs outside of AB/IV and one during AB/IV.<br>
<br>
Vs Forstbolt. Some issues I had with Frost bolt are Improved Frostbolt, while it does increase your DPS without your DPMana, it does increase your Mana per Second consumption, as does partial AB stacking beyond the first stack.<br>
<br>
I had toyed with the idea of leaving Frostbolt at 3 seconds and never stacking AB past the first proc during a down phase, and also down ranking Frost Bolt. Then equiping say the Zul'Aman staff with an INT enchant, and focusing more so on putting myself in a mana surplus rather then mana efficianct DPS till a pot came up. The problem I have with AB/FB/AB/AB/FB x3 is that to be optimal, you have to really be picky on your timing. With a strait FB/FB/FB/AB spam my DPS may not be as great, but dropping the AB buff doesn't hurt you nearly as much. Even if you get a 1.5 second AB at 220 mana, you are still almost doubling your Mana per second via AB over the inital cast time of 2.5 seconds.<br>
<br>
Also Frostbolt require CoE. CoS is almost certain given you'll have a shadow priest, and you can dump the hit needed by Frostbolt.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Tell ya what, please instead of posting an UTTER mess of a post that really is nothing more then a random mindfart, take a little time and actually DO SOME MATH before posting such a pile of complete horseshit.  <br>
<br>
First off AM sucks, it was good at one time and one time only and the only way for it not to suck is for them to either remove the cooldown on the Mystical Skyfire or for WoLK to change some other things.  <br>
<br>
Your theory seems based on changing spells based on procs but have you taken into account that if you change the spell order due to a proc you have just cost yourself a significant amount of dps due to the natural latency between server and client and not being able to take advantage of the spell "queueing" mechanic currently in place.  So your idea was Flawed even before we started looking at the other components, and what components they are....<br>
<br>
Blade of Wizardry??   Are you serious???  So you want me to dump 100 spell damage, 17 hit and 24 crit and also lose 330 mana every ~45 seconds to wait for a proc that lasts for 6 seconds?  <br>
<br>
Have you even compared the amount of dps you lose from trading out a Chaotic Skyfire Meta for a Mystical?  Not even bringing up the loss of dps associated with meeting it's gem requirements.<br>
<br>
I admire your persistance but please take a moment and actually do some work before posting things that just clutter up the thread with pure gibberish.  At the very least go and spend a few hours with Dr Boom so you can bring real numbers to quantify your misconceptions.  Last I checked the test server was open so it won't even cost you real gold to respec/regem for some simple testing.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_742076"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->For those that aren't checking the Rawr thread there was a new release today. You can get download at the usual location <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080513033647/https://www.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ProjectName=Rawr&amp;ReleaseId=13328" target="_blank">https://www.codeplex.com/Release/Pro...eleaseId=13328</a><br>
<br>
The biggest change is the addition of an advanced spell cycle solver that will take into account some of the trickier constraints there were not possible before. Also I've enabled the cycle reconstruction option. It still doesn't take into account timing dependencies between cooldowns and mana consumables (like SCB or when using both flamecaps and mana gems), but I thought it would give some nice info for those not affected. You can get some more details about how it works in the advanced options section at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080513033647/http://www.codeplex.com/Rawr/Wiki/View.aspx?title=Rawr.Mage&amp;referringTitle=Models" target="_blank">Rawr - Home</a><br>

There's currently a display issue that might show one spell cycle 20 times too long, it will be fixed for 14.1 that will be release during the week. I'd suggest you to try it out and report any bugs you find so I can fix any remaining bugs for this patch release.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_744808"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Have to agree with the rest on Jammi,<br>
<br>
Mage's primary job on Archimonde is to decurse and not die.  You could have done 400k damage on him, or got second on DPS. But if you did that by dpsing so much, such that when that one fellow in grips near you needed decursing and you didn't do it. And he died, and the soulcharge wiped the raid with archimonde at 12%.  Then, for all that fancy damage you did, you failed in your true duty on that fight. <br>
<br>
I am sure there will be kills when you are lucky enough that you could DPS the whole fight without having to decurse at all. Its probably cos there was another decurser (whether mage or druid) near you who picked up the ball and did your job for you. <br>
<br>
Archimonde is not a good measure of mage DPS at all. Actually, for spec comparisions, even Teron isn't a very good measure either. Though people love to refer to it. He has so much pushback that arcane suffers an inherent disadvantage compared to fire for that fight. (Fire has 70% pushback immunity). And people die and become ghosts in the fight. So it is hardly a case of all DPSers going full out the whole fight. <br>
<br>
Teron seems to me more about handling ghosts well than about pushing DPS. We die cos ghosts got into the raid, not because DPS was lacking.<br>
<br>
The only few parts in MH and BT where DPS truely matters is Akama stage two, and ROS stage 3. We have had the raid wipe in stage 3 because of insufficient DPS. And we have ever failed to kill Akama's shade in stage two and have to repeat the encounter (though that rarely happens nowadays).<br>
<br>
Nowhere else in any fight in MH and BT is there a big requirement of "do x amount of raid damage within y amount of time or the raid dies". The enrage timer for most BT and MH bosses are just not short enough to have to push DPS to that extent. And most of the fights are more based on getting execution down, moving at the right times, etc, than about DPS. <br>
<br>
If you really want to measure it where it matters, try measuring your DPS during ROS stage 3 or specifically Akama stage 2 and see where you stand. At least I would agree that DPS matters during those two stages. But not for Archimonde.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Akama stage 2 is too short, it takes my guild ~30s to burn him down. Arcane would again have somewhat of an advantage over fire, since you can just go all out and not care about mana.<br>

Pretty much the only fire-friendly boss in this raid instance is Winterchill.<br>

</div>     I think you're assertion that arcane is a tad easier in MH/BT is pretty much right on.<br>
<br>
     Rage Winterchill might be a good boss fight for fire but it's better as arcane.  When I did this as arcane after patch 2.4 I had like 705 mp5 while casting.  That's what showed <b>in my character screen</b>.  In other words I've got a few hundred more than that cycling in from spriests, a shaman, potions, gems etc.  You can spam fully ramped AB the whole 2 minute fight guaranteed.<br>
<br>
     A great fire fight (depending on your guild's strat) would probably be az'galor.  The strat my guild used meant that if you were fire on this fight, you stood in one spot at 41 yards and happily blew the shit out of him without a care in the world while all the arcane mages, shadow priests, and hunters' pets soaked the RoFs.<br>
<br>
     You might also think of Teron Gorefiend due to the pushback avoidance but 2x IV takes the sting off for 40 seconds.<br>
<br>
     Either way, this thread is directed more towards SWP mage play rather than MH/BT.  We're supposed to have been farming that old content for a long time now =).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_744888"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hehe well I'm glad no-one over-reacted ; I was just trying to bring some friendly rivalry into the debate. Which I think I did, but it also raised a few eyebrows having read your reactions....<br>
<br>
1 )  Fire mages live in a world of a 3 second base cast time. Any fight that involves ; decursing, moving  or blinking means that the fire mage has a decision as to whether its worth his while finishing his cast or doing something different. An arcane mage does not have this problem. Please believe when I say that having decursive sat over Archimonde's knees and my mouse hovering waiting to decurse [which I spam when someone gets grip meaning my current cast finishes and immediately de-curse) it is MUCH easier, and better in terms of impact to damage, to be arcane. I did the second most decursing on the actual kill, for example, and I bet you I beat the fire mages to the decurse action 10x more than they did to me. So please don't say "Oh thats a fight where its more important to decurse than dps" because you a) assume I prioritised dps over decursing [which is simply not the case] and b) That decursing causes your dps to falter. Decursing isn't really a problem to an arcane mage. We live on the GCD so losing one to a spell with a much reduced mana cost as opposed to our AB is neither here nor there. <br>
<br>
On many fights these days (PRE-SUNWELL ; I have not stepped foot near that place and have only read from these amazing forums about those encounters, so thats a small proviso but I'm sure they must be similar ; Blizzard has never I believe wanted casters or ranged to be stood still for very long in any encounter since Gruul's one eyed head came into the world) we have to move. Movement gimps a fire mage; gimps his damage, gives him more mana than he can spend, and offers the potential for scorch debuffs to fall off if followed by a silence or someone dying or needing decursing or something that interrupts the casting flow. Arcane's only similar issue would be losing the AB debuff [which happens every ice-block... by the way.. and is REALLY annoying!!] and having to restack it with AB&gt;FrB&gt;AB&gt;FrB etc  due to the AB casting bug which is a real pain in the bum.<br>
<br>
<br>
2) Rage winterchill has frost resistance so if an arcane mage (arc/frost) beats you on that fight, he got very lucky with resists, or had a very good SP (or lots of movement = regen time "I had to move for 23 seconds, ooh goodie I've now got LOADS of mana to spunk on AB spam!") or the movement screwed you over and actually helped him...<br>
<br>
3 ) I'm slightly disconcerted by all the people saying "This fight isn;t fair to compare you have to x, y or z" or "Teron is an unfair comparison due to pushbacks which fire gets 70% chance to avoid"...<br>
<br>
Guys (and girls) ; reality check please ; If your spec causes you to not be able to do as much damage as someone else - Change it. Do not whine and say "Aww mommy it wasn't fair."...  That is <i> totally </i> against I believe as a raider. Any mage that I heard excusing low dps with saying "I did more decursing than you" or "oh but but Supremus has fire resistance" needs to learn that every fight (from Morogrim AoE causing serious mana issues back in the day to necessitate mana oil and/or mage armor to survive, to any fight involving movement) has its ups and downs and if your spec allows you to beat most of them ; it is a better than spec than one that doesn't. Mages who expect to be able to stand still and nuke without any concerns in order to do their optimum dps, frankly, are not maximising their opportunity to eek the benefit from the options available to them.<br>
<br>
4) Cooldowns. On almost all fights that matter (and most that don't) ; as someone else said "The difference between an excellent mage and a mediocre one is only in CD control &amp; management." – Pintofbrew, Kilrogg EU.<br>
<br>
I have ; two icy veins, one cold snap, two iceblocks, one arcane power, and a POM ; every 5 minutes. You have combustion and icy veins. That's your only CDs to manage. (BTW this "you" fire mage and me "arcane mage" is again just banter )<br>
If I get ghosted on Teron : In the 20 seconds I have before I leave ; I can dump an entire mana bar into him with AB spam with Arcane Power up, POM as I run to the corner, with a 40% threat reduction... That is a HUGE dps boost that isn't achievable with fire. This is one example where arcane vs fire has a clear difference. IF you exclude the ability to do this from your comments on Teron.. then I think you're not seeing the whole picture. You say "70% pushback resistance is a plus - I say, having two icy veins (to guarantee a safe evocate), 40% threat reduction, and more cooldowns, more often - gives me flexibility to adapt to a boss encounter you can only dream of!!<br>

</div>Yeah no its natural  I was dropped on my face as a child  I'm sorry to have wound you up amigo.<br>
<br>
I like how you shouted that the other mage did 200% more decursing than me in his kill.<br>
If you notice ; he was one of two mages on his kill. He did 23 and the other mage did 9.<br>
I did 12 ; the other FOUR mages in raid with me did (on that kill) 11, 1, 4 and 6 respectively.<br>
<br>
So your argument that I'm not doing my job (when I, in fact, did more decursing than any other mage in the raid with me) doesn't hold any water now does it?<br>
Also don't presume to dare tell me I'm not doing my job unless your argument is sound. Which it isn't. As 1/5th of the mages present on my kill - and with him being 1/2 of the mages present on HIS kill - I did proportionaly more decursing than him. <br>
<br>
What you could mention ; would be the fact that he was very unlucky and had to decurse a hell of a lot and that the mage he was fighting with did APPALLINGly badly to have done when he had only 9 decurses to do. Either that or the second mage needs to get decursive installed and put somewhere convenient on his screen (and bind all abilities to buttons so he can dps and watch decursive 99% of the time) so that he doesn't get beaten to the punch on decursing. However, for all we know - the mage that came second could have been leading the raid and had other priorities. You can't ever know.<br>
<br>
I stated when I made it I said, "comparison hardly supporting my comical aside"... so, I hope you can see now, was mostly joking, partly baiting, and partially trying to make a point about arcane's superiority in many many TBC situations as described above.<br>
<br>
I would urge anyone thinking "Arcane is great when you get an SP and CoS and mana-tide but I'd &lt;insert defamory action here&gt; when you don't" to try the spec out. Its makes movement a thing to rejoice, and allows you to go nuts and have more fun DPSing throughout the fight, not just on 20% onwards.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Hardly ; on Kazrogal- frostbolt spamming the other day my mana bar didn't even drop as I was casting. My regen equalled the cost of the frostbolts for a short period of time. Thats not possible with fire. <br>
<br>
As arcane you gear for huge intellect, huge regen, and you use mage armor to increase / sustain your dps - and only use molten on fights such as Supremus or Archie when the dps time is similar to movement times overall. Mage armor being your best armor comes in VERY handy in TBC encounters ; as many involve resistance gear. We also benefit from Mag absorption which not only increases our resistance - but returns mana to us on a full resist (Which, considering I only took two marks last time is ALOT of mana!!) . On Kazrogal arcane is neither superior or inferior ; IF you consider the whole picture.<br>

</div>Yes but all those GCDs add up, and aren't uniformly distributed across attempts. If you never get tombed and are lucky enough to avoid all/most of the Death and Decays then this is going to have a considerable effect on your overall dps.

				<div style="font-style:italic">Forgive my ignorance, but...<br>
<br>
Anetheron- If you DPS the boss, fire's fine.  If you DPS the infernals, fire is behind.<br>
Kaz'rogal- Surely the hit to your mana pool makes this a far better fight for fire?<br>
Az'Galor-Fire outranges the ROF, arcane doesn't (unless it spams frostbolt?).  I think fire wins this one.<br>
Archimonde- Arcane has the advantage here as it can take advantage of the burn windows.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Rage Winterchill - Arcane wins hands down due to Brilliance Aura.  If you throw a frostbolt as arcane in this fight something is wrong.<br>
<br>
Anetheron - Your likely to spend half your time dpsing the infernals, but they don't really pose that big of a problem if you have 2 locks, and they throw up CoE/CoS.  Though if you a wear a bit of shadow resist, arcane likely pulls ahead.<br>
<br>
Kaz'rogal - Shadow resist set + magic absorption = mana gained, not lost, from Mark.  Also arcane mages can ice block twice out of the debuff.  Though you have to restack your debuff.  Maybe I'll submit a bug report, and see if I can get this fixed.<br>
<br>
Azgalor - RoF is a joke, arcane is great if you wear some SR, low threat + silence resist = win.<br>
<br>
Archimonde - Sucks for fire, great for arcane.<br>
<br>
Trash - Arcane is the clear winner here as well. PoM + polymorph on 6 necro waves = win.  The sheer dps output of AE spam is crazy, too.<br>
<br>
If you want to double your mp5 while casting on Rage Winterchill/Anetheron make your group stand near Jaina.  Also an innervate will take you from 0 mana to full while chaining 1s arcane blasts (IV/AP/Heroism) while standing near Jaina.  So burn hard, and ask for an innervate when you hit 5-10% mana.<br>

</div>It's called Brilliance Aura from being in proximity of Lady Jaina Proudmoore (this depends on your tanking positioning) If you stay in range of it, it increases your spirit by 100%.  This allowed me to achieve about 700 mp5 while casting where I normally have just under 400 or so.<br>
<br>
Edit:<br>
Pintofbrew beat me to the punch on that one, Grayrest.  But yes, my point was Brilliance Aura <i>could</i> make it more favorable for an arcane mage vs a fire mage that's all.  I should go ahead and point out that when I was speaking of that specific fight I was referring to Brilliance Aura, which is a mechanic of this specific fight.  I was taking that as a given, assuming everyone would know what I was referring to when I posted that.  <br>
<br>
Yes Pint, I know why my mp5 was high, I wasn't wondering "how the hell did I pull that off?" the statement was nitpicking fight mechanics since that's what the discussion has petered into. <br>
<br>
I apologize for engaging in pointless banter over the topic.  I will restrain from chiming in and playing devil's advocate (sorry).<br>
<br>
If someone were a new mage asking me what to spec for MH/BT, I would definitely respond, smilingly, with something like, "What color is better, Red or Blue?"  This would be to give them an idea of how opinionated the discussion is.  At this point, it is proven that both are viable and competitive for the content.  The only way one could give any advice regarding the issue is if your intrepid inquirer simply wanted to mindlessly copy your exact moves and that is <i>not</i> what is to be promoted in these forums.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_745162"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Both specs are fun and both are viable throughout current raiding.  They both have the potential to do equivalent levels of dps.  Arc/Frost requires more raid support but is compensated through faster ramp-up and more frequent bursts of damage on a long encounter.  Fire is more constant dps but is affected a bit more by RNG determining its actual individual performance, it also isn't anywhere near as reliant on being grouped with a Shadowpriest which can be an issue on the Twins where healing is the priority.<br>
<br>
I was specced Arc/Frost for all of SWP so far and just yesterday specced back to Fire but I may spec back to Arc/Frost at some point just because I prefer not to get bored being stuck as one spec.  Both have their good points and their bad points and it's really nice to be able to raid as either and still be just as viable.  Good thing that it is relatively simple and cheap to respec, change out a few pieces of gear and move a few macros and be all set to go as an other spec.<br>
<br>
<br>
My issue with Jammi and it still remains is that he picked an encounter that is completely retarded to attempt to demonstrate any abject superiority for either of the 2 specs.  Show me Brutallus where both mages are in the same raid group, show me Teron.  Just about any other encounter, even Dr Boom, would have more relevance to the discussion then Archimonde.<br>
<br>
Your job on Archi (like everyone else who has posted has said) is not to die and to decurse.  Your dps is completely irrelevant to the encounter.  Did the other mage put on some PvP gear to ease the load on the healers?  Did he run a doomfire away from the raid the way he is supposed to to ensure that it doesn't curve around and head back into the melee.  Was he stuck spending so much of his time decursing that scorch fell off the target?  These are all things that can and will happen during that encounter and none of it matters since his only jobs there are to decurse and not to die.<br>
<br>
Lets look a little closer at those WWSs shall we, since you seem content that they demonstrate your point.<br>
<br>
First off your kill took 8 minutes and 14seconds and theirs took 3 minutes and 52seconds.  Your kill had 5 mages decursing along with 2 out of 4 of the druids present.  Their kill had 2 mages present and of the 3 druids present only 1 decursed anything.  You had 44 total decurses and they had 39.  <br>
<br>
So that means you decursed 27% of the total curses present and he decursed 59%.  So I guess I really was wrong on that point.  He did quite a bit more then 200% of your decursing. <br>
<br>
So what about that difference in overall fight length?  You used 12 GCDs for decursing which is 3.6% of the total time available in the encounter.  He decursed 23 times which is 14.9% of the total time available for the encounter.<br>
<br>
Finally we all know that WWS's dps is skewed in favor of Arcane due to the DoT on Fireball.  Good thing you can open another column and see the average dps done over the whole encounter (which as Manly has pointed out numerous times is the real number to look at when comparing dps between specs).<br>
<br>
Your 1217dps was in actuality 892dps.  His 1209dps was actually 1188dps.  <br>
<br>
So I guess what the WWS reports really show is that even in a raid group that minimized your own personal level of responsibility to the point where you were actually able to spend the majority of your time dpsing you still failed by comparison to a mage who not only shouldered the majority of the decursing but who also outdpsed the crap outta you.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">1 )  Fire mages live in a world of a 3 second base cast time. Any fight that involves ; decursing, moving  or blinking means that the fire mage has a decision as to whether its worth his while finishing his cast or doing something different. An arcane mage does not have this problem. Please believe when I say that having decursive sat over Archimonde's knees and my mouse hovering waiting to decurse [which I spam when someone gets grip meaning my current cast finishes and immediately de-curse) it is MUCH easier, and better in terms of impact to damage, to be arcane.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>You may not realise, but you know ahead of time when the curse is due to be cast, which allows you to adapt your casts for when decurses are going to be due, and switch to scorch/fireblast. But regardless, you have yet to prove me that more decursing = better job. All that matters is people not dying. Not the amount of decursing. The difference is quite stark since it means your real goal is to decurse ideally somewhere before the first tick of the curse - not when it is just put up. <br>
<br>
And FWIW, you contradict yourself. <i>"decision as to whether its worth his while finishing his cast or doing something different. An arcane mage does not have this problem."</i> You clearly indicate that you spam decurse so that it is cast after you finish casting your current spell, which means you wait to finish your cast just as well as the fire mage. You would have that problem if the fight required twitch reflexes. Unfortunately, no fight in the game save Noth and Sapphiron fits into that category.<br>

Arcane's only similar issue would be losing the AB debuff [which happens every ice-block... by the way.. and is REALLY annoying!!] and having to restack it with AB&gt;FrB&gt;AB&gt;FrB etc  due to the AB casting bug which is a real pain in the bum.</div>

</div>Movement also gimps arcanes damage. And I'm sorry to say but I can't seem to recall a fight where scorch specifically falls off. Maybe if you have bad mages. A good example would be a fight where the boss clears all debuffs, but again, thats unrelated with movement. The closest I can imagine is archimonde, but if Archimonde is the one example you're basing yourself on, then your argument holds no weight. If a fire mage loses a scorch stack (on archimonde), it means arcane is far more likely to lose AB stacks.<br>
<br>
Also, you seriously need to understand that <i>"gives him more mana than he can spend"</i> does not apply to fire. Fire does not like remotely have mana issues. The only time I use evocation is after phase 2 on Illidan and maybe* kaz'rogal if I don't get any resist. Fire does not have mana issues, and <i>always</i> has more mana than it can spend. Movement does not affects that.<br>

</div>Fire mages have trinkets, drums, molten fury (yes, this is a cooldown for all means and purposes), combustion, icy veins, bloodlust, flame cap and destruction potion. Thats a lot more than just combustion and icy veins. And on the contrary to your claim, I believe that fire mages are better suited to fit any situation than an arcane mage for the simple reason that we have a stronger and more flexible arsenal of spells. I'm talking {arcane blast, frostbolt and arcane explosion} vs {scorch, fireball, fireblast, dragon's breath, blastwave, arcane explosion}. This is a bit the reason that warlocks don't fare all too well on trash - they are fairly limited to {shadowbolt, seed of corruption}, which offers very low flexibility. I know many guilds have warlocks topping meters on trash (I'm talking non-aoe trash), but if you play against a good fire mage they'll fall significantly behind simply because of that flexibility.<br>
<br>
I am not denying that having a 1.5s cast time main spell has its advantages, but it won't magically make you the most flexible by virtue of having a short cast time. I am not arguing about threat - in my experience it has rarely been an issue save on eredar twins reverse order.<br>

</div>What does it matter whether you can go 'nuts' only at the final 20% or on the entirety of the fight ? All that matters is final damage. And for what its worth, arcane is restrained to pop its cooldown during bloodlust, not exactly 'at any given time'. Which kinds of goes back to what I was saying: "what does it matter <i>when</i> you can go nuts?". Both fire and arcane depends on when bloodlust is activated.<br>

</div>Why not?<br>
<br>
I submit that you do more dps on Kaz/Azgalor/Anetheron with the resist gear, than you would without.  I'm not saying go full SR, but <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32649" target="_blank">[Medallion of Karabor]</a>+<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32420" target="_blank">[Night's End]</a> w/<a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28277" target="_blank">[Formula: Enchant Cloak - Greater Shadow Resistance]</a> works great.  This puts you at 183SR with 0/5MA, which is high enough to partially resist ~40% of the time.  Since the silences/mark/carrion swarm are binary spells you can fully resist almost half of them!<br>
<br>
So I submit that with the 2 pieces of SR gear above, you'll have more mana on Kaz'rogal, less silences on Azgalor, and be a relatively tough target on Anetheron (damn if my healer always gets swarmed).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_745258"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->There is one other disadvantage to Arc/Frost that no one has mentioned.  That 1.5s cast time means you are just about always inside the GCD which means that Ice Block is no longer an instant thing since it no longer activates during the GCD even with a /stopcasting macro in place.<br>
<br>
There have been a few occassions in SWP where I went for Ice Block to avoid dying and got the spell not ready message and died.  Sure you could argue that it is the healers responsibility to prevent that situation from occurring but with our limited health pools and the amount of damage thrown around being practically insta-gibbed is not completely uncommon and being perpetually inside the GCD does make that an issue that Fire doesn't have to deal with quite as badly since Fire's spells take longer to cast so they spend less total time inside the GCD. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
On another note, has anyone retested Arcane Blast in 2.4.2 to see if the whole 2.5-2.5 thing is still in place.  I tried stacking the debuff with straight Arcane Blast spam last night and even though the cast bar was showing the bug my latency meter on Quartz was significantly larger then normal (during the stacking) and then returned to normal once AB was full stacked) and it seemed like the spells were casting much faster then the bugged casting bar would lead one to believe.<br>

This wasn't a little, this was like half the bar being Red.  I also for the life of me can't figure out if that proves the point that the AB stacking is bugged or if it shows that the cast times may be stacking correctly server side but showing incorrectly on the client side.  Hurts my head to think about it which was why I was suggesting the stopwatch approach.  I would do it myself but I am lazy and have never figured out how to spam keys besides manually which is not exactly the most accurate of methods.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I wonder if it's supposed to be a tradeoff between mobility and spell damage.  Obviously, with most on-use trinkets, you can pop it and keep blasting, and if a deadly boss ability heads your way, you can move and still keep the benefit, provided you have time to fire another cast after the movement.  With this Power Circle implementation, they could make it so that you'd have to risk getting gibbed by &lt;random boss ability&gt; to gain the full effect of the trinket. *shrugs*<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Also, apparently since 2.4.2 the trinket cooldown is 90s instead of 2min, finally matching better the 15s duration (I mean, makes more sense). And yes, before someone mentions it, I am well aware that thottbot/wowhead does not confirms my claims.<br>

Before people ask, its single player. And it has always been. Pre-2.4.2 it was giving a buff to everyone, but the buff was inactive except to the trinket holder. They changed the name of the buff in 2.4.2 and now it only applies to the caster.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Awesome you just proved to us how much of an idiot you really are thank you! Frostbolt is a binary spell it can only hit or not hit and it can not be partially resisted. On Rage as well you would as Manly pointed out Arcane Blast him. WTF are you talking about with movement.. it should not take you 23 seconds to move out of Death and Decay even like a chicken with your head cut off. Also, with frostbolt, assuming that you put 3 points into elemental precision and you are hit capped the number that you do miss with your frostbolts should be around 1% anyways as it is a hit or miss binary spell.</div>

</div><br>
This is actually incorrect.<br>
<br>
A binary spell can only hit or miss but when casting on something with a significant amount of resistance it will miss a lot more then 1% of the time.<br>
<br>
How a binary spell works is that first the level based resistances are checked and then the resistances are checked.  Any additional +hit that you have will actually be applied against the target's resistances and will actually act like spell penetration (whereas for any spell that can be partially resisted the additional hit is simply wasted).<br>
<br>
The classic example:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px; ">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:0px"><img src="assets/citation.gif" border="0"></div>
	<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="100%">
	<tbody><tr>
		<td class="alt2" style="border:1px inset">
			
				    For binary spells only, there is an additional modifier for the resistance of the victim to your particular spell school: fire, frost, shadow, nature, arcane. That modifier is multiplied by your hit chance to get your actual chance to land. This is done with binary spells only, because they never do partial damage.<br>
<br>
    Example:<br>
<br>
    Eyonix the Mage (level 60) fires a frost bolt at Yeti of Doom (level 63). Eyonix is also wearing a total of +6% spell hit gear. Yeti of Doom has frost resistance such that he takes 50% from level 60 frost attacks. So, here‘s the hit calculation:<br>
<br>
    0.83 (83% for +3 levels mob) + 0.06 (+6% spell hit) = 0.89<br>
<br>
    0.89*0.5 (50% damage from frost) = 0.445.<br>
<br>
    The game will roll a number between 0 and 1, and if it‘s less than 0.445, the frost bolt will hit for full damage. Otherwise, a resist message will appear.<br>
<br>
    2nd Example:<br>
<br>
    After the resist, Eyonix decides to fire a fireball at Yeti of Doom. Eyonix still has +6% spell hit. Fireball is not a binary spell. Here‘s the calculation:<br>
<br>
    0.83+0.06= 0.89<br>
<br>
    The game will roll a number between 0 and 1, and if its less than 0.89, the fireball will hit. Otherwise, a resist message will appear. After the fireball lands, the game will then apply spell resistance to determine a partial resist, if any. Assuming the yeti also has 50% fire resistance, on average, 50% of the damage will be resisted.<br>
<br>
    I hope that illuminates the impact of +spell hit gear on magical combat.

</div>For Binary spells the first equation is unbound (can give a result above 100) meaning that additional +hit will be applied towards the second part (which is why it acts like spell penetration).<br>

</div>Actually, empyrical evidence proves you wrong too.<br>
<br>
Historically TC has dictated that there is 'unmitigeable' partial resists which are level-based (ie: ~2% per +1 level, with ~5-6% partial resists on boss-level types). In practice, this has never been shown to be true, even despise the oft-cited blue example. I am talking here about binary spells, or frostbolt in particular.<br>
<br>
If binary spells are single-rolls, then you can conclude that, assuming 'unmitigeable' partial resists apply to them (corrolary: why shouldn't they ?), that binary spells should 'suffer' an extraneous 5-6% miss rate. In practice, I have <b>never</b> seen this to be the case. It used to be said, back in the day, that overflowing on hit rating (ie: &gt; 16%) was able to affect your 'unmitigeable' resists since it was a single-roll. Problem is, I have never seen evidence of that, or let alone see level-based resists affect binary spells.<br>
<br>
---<br>
Just to dispell some myth. If you check WWS you will see on average 4-5% fire partial resistance on bosses. This is because the shown damage on the combatlogs of partial resist hits don't take into account debuffs on the target (!). I have never verified it, but this is what I have read on the partial resistance thread. So the 4-5% combat-log-shown resistance is in fact higher than that in practice if the above is true, leading theorycally into the realms of the expected ~5-6% unmitigeable partial resistance on boss-level mobs.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_745757"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I really hope that it is not because of you guys, but tonight having 10% hit 3 points in elem.prec. and a draenei shaman in my group, i was having around 4% resist on each boss.<br>
Don't know if somebody have payed attention to it but the conclusion from those over 1000 frostbolts for me is <br>
<br>
1) Either Blizzard ninja nurfed elem.prec. to its normal value of +3% hit<br>
2) Or they have implemented the same system Manly is talking about in the above post!<br>
<br>
Anyway I am depressed now, because i cannot figure out how to get all that lacking +hit, but still have in mind that there is a change in the +hit required for frost now.<br>

</div>I never said that Binary are single-roll.  I said that Binary functioms as a 2 roll system.  I know that the partial resists that are supposed to occur are missing but that doesn't mean that they aren't functional on a fight where the target actually has frost resistance.  I've been frost on rage without CoE and you will miss a literal shit ton on him which implies that while there may be something fishy going on with the level based resistances there is nothing wrong with how binary resists function on a target with actual resistances.<br>
<br>
Another thing to keep in mind is that due to those binary resistances any additional hit acts as spell penetration and that due to the 2 roll mechanic it actually would be able to remove those "unremovable" resistances.  Pretty sure that even 1 additional +hit would be enough to remove those resistances completely.<br>
<br>
<br>
As for where this all was proven.  There was a nice thread in the old forums prior to TBC that had a TC sticky and at the very end of it there was an experiment done by a couple of warlocks who took the time to prove/disprove how the binary spell mechanic functioned.  They sat down and put on resistance gear and varying degrees of hit gear and cast CoR and then CoS at each other and checked the resist rates and were able to get a sample size of a sufficient quantity that they proved that for binary spells additional hit acts like spell penetration.  <br>
<br>
If the mechanic was changed after TBC came out I really wouldn't know but since most testing of the mechanics with Frostbolt were done before people realized about the phantom hit associated with elemental precision it is quite possible that the reason no one saw the 5% miss predicated by those unremovable resistances is that they were wearing an overabundance of +hit to the point where those resists were being penetrated unknowingly.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

If you won't accept that I decurse like a pro, more than any other mage in my raid, and even tonight on Archimonde again my warlock friend in my group was saying I decurse like instantaneously (because im almost always coming out of a 1.5 second cast time during the fight)  - then you are clearly hiding yourself behind some weird kind of denial. The fact that you missed the tone of my post which was mildly inflammatory (in a tongue in cheek way) coming off the back of a fun night raiding on a first time downing of Archie where I did my job in an exemplorary fashion, introducing an element of "arcane can and does deliver" ..

				<div style="font-style:italic">I'm glad you spent so much time digging down into the depths of the WWS to find statistics that merely back up the fact that you missed the spirit and obvious intonation of my post. If you won't accept that I decurse like a pro, more than any other mage in my raid, and even tonight on Archimonde again my warlock friend in my group was saying I decurse like instantaneously (because im almost always coming out of a 1.5 second cast time during the fight)  - then you are clearly hiding yourself behind some weird kind of denial. The fact that you missed the tone of my post which was mildly inflammatory (in a tongue in cheek way) coming off the back of a fun night raiding on a first time downing of Archie where I did my job in an exemplorary fashion, introducing an element of "arcane can and does deliver" .. "fire has limitations whenever you have to move".. means that there is no point in even discussing it with you. Re-read the post, though I think you are too far gone with your conviction.</div>

</div>Probably gonna get a warning for a useless post but you are, to put it quite simply, an idiot.<br>
<br>
I was Arc/Frost up till yesterday and I probably will be again too, so not sure where the hell convictions come into play.  You brought up a WWS to compare to yours saying "OOO look at me, I'm Arcane and I rocked the meters so much harder then that other other guild's fire mage even though he had better gear".<br>
<br>
Then we point out that Archi is not a good fight to make comparisons from, and you argue that.  Then I point out that your decursing sucked compared to the other mages, so you argued that.  Then I actually break down the dps and the actual raid groups and show that the other mage's performance was far superior to your own and now it's my convictions that are preventing me from seeing the brilliance that is you.<br>
<br>
Sorry but I think you really just need to take a moment to examine your own convictions and figure out why you are unable to come to grips with why your entire conceptualization of Arcane as the superior spec fails so miserably.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_746078"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I think its because it just much easier to play fire well than to play arcane well. <br>
<br>
I see tons of mages in wow forums and even here who have obviously not raided as arcane. And even those that contemplate the spec from their eixisting frost or fire spec often do not have a clear idea of what makes that spec work. They are still trying to come up with some kind of set rotations, think rotations matter, and think they need to conserve mana through rotations so that they can spam AB during bloodlust. <br>
<br>
They are in fire gear emphasising +dmg,+hit, +haste, with low stats. And they wonder why they are doing so badly when they switch to arcane. <br>
<br>
It just reinforces even more steorotyped views about arcane which isn't needed.  Fire specs don't need to be explained. Every decent mage should know how to raid well with fire. Keep scorch up, fireball away, time your trinkets, destruction pots, etc with bloodlust and molten fury stage. <br>
<br>
But arcane spec raiding is not as well understood. Especially if its from mage who have never raided as arcane before. The legacy issues that cause AM spam to be popular in legacy patches, and complex AB cycles in others haven't helped and have been perpetuated by mages who are not up to date.  Not everyone has been reading and following all the mage TC threads on EJ forums from the very first page.<br>
<br>
Even the sweet information thread, is not very complete in that it doesn't address arcane spec raiding sufficiently. <br>
<br>
If arcane specs was just an oddball spec with no serious raid viability compared to fire. Then it probably wouldn't matter. But it isn't. Its a viable competitive raiding spec to fire. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses. So, the many misconeptions and failure to understand that AB spam is at the core of arcane raiding makes things worse.<br>
<br>
If everyone understood perfectly how to raid well as arcane. I would be very silent. But many mages don't. I believe even amongst the experts, there is some uncertainty on smaller issues like which spells to use as filler, whether it is truely best to gem for int,spirit vs damage. And to what extent haste rating is good for arcane. <br>
<br>
Fire specs don't need that much discussion or even explanation at this point. Are there really a lot of issues to clear up about how to raid well with fire or how to maximise fire dps? Arcane - there is not even any clear "accepted" method of how to raid well with arcane.  Some say alternate frostbolt/AB to always keep the debuff up, but still try and spam AB as much as possible. Others might say go with the two cycle theory. Spam AB, then use filler like frostbolt when low on mana only when necessary. Is there an "accepted" way of masimising arcane DPS agreed by all the experts here? There isn't. <br>
<br>
Is int, spirit accepted as the way to gem for arcane? Rawr shows that. But I rarely, if ever come across arcane mages that really out fit every single one of their slots with +int gems. Because int,spirit is only that good for the long fights. For the short fights, gemming +dmg is still better. <br>
<br>
Arcane deserves much more discussion than fire simply because it is not as well researched, not as well theorycrafted and not as well understood. The pity is that it always degenerates into a fire vs arcane argument. It shouldn't be at all. Arcane mages should be gathering together to try and figure out how to maximise arcane dps in all situations and how best to gear up for it in all situations. Not try to argue that their dps is better than fire.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I tried stacking the debuff with straight Arcane Blast spam last night and even though the cast bar was showing the bug my latency meter on Quartz was significantly larger then normal (during the stacking) and then returned to normal once AB was full stacked) and it seemed like the spells were casting much faster then the bugged casting bar would lead one to believe.<br>

Maybe someone with a G15, a spam macro and a stopwatch could go a few rounds with Dr. Boom and see if that bug is still actually active or merely a client-side UI discrepancy.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Also, you seriously need to understand that "gives him more mana than he can spend" does not apply to fire. Fire does not like remotely have mana issues. The only time I use evocation is after phase 2 on Illidan and maybe* kaz'rogal if I don't get any resist. Fire does not have mana issues, and always has more mana than it can spend.

	</tbody></table>
</div>Sorry to take you away from the unending Arcane vs Fire arguments, but I've seen you say this before, Manly, and I'm interested to know what you assume to make this judgment. The reason I ask is that my guild killed Illidan for the first time a month ago (so we normally do better than the examples I'm about to give) and I ran OOM on a pretty poor Teron kill last night that went for over six minutes. This is clearly not a regular lasting Teron fight but I potted twice, gemmed once, used a full 10 second evocate and used a flame cap near the end (before everyone started dying and we limped through to a kill - of course I had planned for a shorter fight and ended up OOM 30 seconds before the kill due to the flame cap). I did not have a shadow priest or a resto shaman, only a moonkin. The mana issues were hardly isolated to this fight - on Naj'entus I gemmed twice, potted twice, and got half an evocate during a shield <i>with</i> a shadow priest and still OOMed a few seconds before the end. This fight lasted a little over 5 minutes.<br>
<br>
Now obviously our fights take longer than yours would due to lower DPS (which also means the returns from a shadow priest are less as they do less damage themselves) but do your statements that a fire mage has nothing approaching mana issues assume sufficient DPS for a three minute Teron kill, a shadow priest, a resto shaman and chain potting which then doesn't even require an evocation? Or do you think a mage only gemming and evocating with no other synergy would be able to keep himself going?<br>
<br>
Obviously this question is a bit loaded, but some sort of statement from Manly (and other high end mages) would be useful for a lot of people to show their guilds in case that mages do have mana issues outside of decent group setups and where the guild DPS is lower than that of the top end guilds where mages might in fact have no mana issues.<br>
<br>
[Disclaimer: I'm in no way trying to foster the already terrible Arcane vs. Fire arguments - I've played arcane for a week or two but respecced fire due to arcane having even more emphasis on the terrible mechanic that is mana. I'd love for Blizzard to give us some sort of interesting mechanic like Rage or Energy or Runes but I guess that ship's already sailed.]<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I cant believe this is getting blown out of proportion like this. I actually am losing faith with EJ... Which I didn't think was possible because normally its so good.<br>
<br>
You have patronisingly assumed that I am some bone-headed arcane wannabe, not the TCing no-lifer that I actually am. I have tried all specs and all rotations from within a raiding environment, and would not be here posting if I didn't know what I was talking about.<br>
<br>
You have <b> assumed </b> that because I linked the wws that I think that Archimonde is a fight where dps is more important than decursing. You were wrong. And you  (plural) refuse to accept it.<br>
<br>
You also still pertain to understand arcane as it is in 2.4 ; which you clearly don't. I could put the time and effort into explaining my posts and proving to you that you're wrong. But I think for once I'm actually going to let you guys think what you like.<br>
<br>
I came back to raiding a few weeks/months ago as 2.3 hit - new gems, new nerfed evocate, new mana regen from int/spirit - and on my own came up with the spec that I thought was the best. This then became the "2/48/11" spec and I found out that I wasn't the only one to see the positives of icy veins and having all the fire damage trees.<br>
To now have evolved into a spec that suits soo many fights pre-sunwell, and have it perform so well with what (for me) used to be a relatively poor gear level, which totally contradicts the old thinking regarding the gear required for the old rotations ; with such clear benefits on some fights, and then to have more than one of you totally miss the sentiment of my post ; label me an "arcane flag waver" - and call me an idiot - shows just how weak your argument(s) is/are.<br>
<br>
To actually make out like Teron is a better fight to compare DPS on I find amusing, since on Teron I use iceblock to help healers when I get incinerated (losing AB debuff and having to sit through the painful bugged re-stacking, or interweave frostbolts even when I have enough mana to warrant AB spam) sometimes twice ; which [seeing as you've raided as arcane Rounced] you know messes with when you might want to use cold snap, and when you ideally can from a dps-perspective...<br>
<br>
But its too late. Damage is done. As has been shown you aren't likely to re-assess me and its a shame to think that your understanding of arcane is so poor. <br>
<br>
BTW ; To hopefully move the dicussion on slightly ; does anyone else feel severely hampered by the new spell queue system? I do not trust it especially during times of excessive haste (close to, on, or below the 1 second gcd) and rather than be duped into thinking I'm casting 1 second casts and actually (through the magic of server/client confusion) be given 1.05 or 1.1 second casts - I'd rather switch to other spells that avoid getting the "That spell is not ready yet" error. I never like to let my client think for itself, and hence still use quartz (and for some things like ice lance, for farming) a stopcast macro.<br>
Or.. conversely... from some decent testing... has it been shown to correctly work in all scenarios and actually be the basis for a caster revolution in terms of not needing quartz/stopcasting?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Well, the problem is that people are bringing the wrong arguments. There are upsides to every spec, but people trying to vouch for arcane give the arguments that don't matter. Or my favorite people trying to ague about fire spec mana.<br>
<br>
With this said, I think this is kind of the unease of talking about arcane is that everything is situational. Everything comes into play. Mana tide, spriest dps, JOW, number of innervates, fight duration will totally change the numbers. Then I don't think many mages will agree that going full int gemming is 'acceptable' in the sense that - while optimal, it is basically 'single-sided' gemming that won't work on any other spec. I think the playstyle of arcane is quite simply all about understanding DPM. The guideline isn't hard at all. I think what kind of is missing is strategies/methodologies about how to  plan your DPM ahead of time. This is something I would instinctively do, if I were to start play arcane seriously. But oddly enough it seems like nobody took the time to put more than basic outline about how to play arcane. Or maybe just everyone assumes that understanding how tools like rawr/magegraf is what it takes to know how to play, and maybe that looking at the result is good enough to satisfy most peoples desire to play well? (again, this is pure speculation).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Sorry to take you away from the unending Arcane vs Fire arguments, but I've seen you say this before, Manly, and I'm interested to know what you assume to make this judgment. The reason I ask is that my guild killed Illidan for the first time a month ago (so we normally do better than the examples I'm about to give) and I ran OOM on a pretty poor Teron kill last night that went for over six minutes. This is clearly not a regular lasting Teron fight but I potted twice, gemmed once, used a full 10 second evocate and used a flame cap near the end (before everyone started dying and we limped through to a kill - of course I had planned for a shorter fight and ended up OOM 30 seconds before the kill due to the flame cap). I did not have a shadow priest or a resto shaman, only a moonkin. The mana issues were hardly isolated to this fight - on Naj'entus I gemmed twice, potted twice, and got half an evocate during a shield <i>with</i> a shadow priest and still OOMed a few seconds before the end. This fight lasted a little over 5 minutes.<br>
<br>
Now obviously our fights take longer than yours would due to lower DPS (which also means the returns from a shadow priest are less as they do less damage themselves) but do your statements that a fire mage has nothing approaching mana issues assume sufficient DPS for a three minute Teron kill, a shadow priest, a resto shaman and chain potting which then doesn't even require an evocation? Or do you think a mage only gemming and evocating with no other synergy would be able to keep himself going?<br>
<br>
Obviously this question is a bit loaded, but some sort of statement from Manly (and other high end mages) would be useful for a lot of people to show their guilds in case that mages do have mana issues outside of decent group setups and where the guild DPS is lower than that of the top end guilds where mages might in fact have no mana issues.<br>
<br>
[Disclaimer: I'm in no way trying to foster the already terrible Arcane vs. Fire arguments - I've played arcane for a week or two but respecced fire due to arcane having even more emphasis on the terrible mechanic that is mana. I'd love for Blizzard to give us some sort of interesting mechanic like Rage or Energy or Runes but I guess that ship's already sailed.]</div>

</div>Well, from my experience, besides ROS phase 2, I've rarely ever, since TBC came out, ran into mana issues. Maybe on the first few morogrim, but that is about it. I am not sure if I can put it more bluntly. Besides things like mana draining mobs its not really something that happens. I do run in the assumption that shadow priest is always provided, and we've always opted strategies that you won't run into mana issues (ie: use 1 mage to do all the morogrim aoe). I think the only time where mana seemed like a real issue was like when we were starting m'uru and assumed hey maybe if we aoe for 5-7 minutes this might be doable, which clearly would not have been remotely doable as firespec. Of course, we didn't go for that, since its simply not doable.<br>
<br>
If anything as you clear the places for months after a while you'll get to see what I mean. It shouldn't take too long either (unless you have like really bad spriests). Sadly I am not sure what to add - firespec mana consumption should be close to brainless and rarely come into play.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Sure, go ahead. Personally I think theses forums just give a baseline about how to play properly (and yes even for firespec). A lot of grounds are not covered about how to abuse every single nuance of mechanics in the game, but I think ultimately everyone has some learning process you learn along the way. Sometimes I get specific questions about how to stack cooldowns, but the truth is, every answer will depend on the situation at hand. I somewhat enjoy keeping tabs on my haste ratings and how it affects possible spell-chainings giving rolling ignites, but for all practical means for me its nothing more than a TC curiosity. I do try to abuse rolling ignites on movement fights, but thats about as far as 'abusing rolling ignites' go.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_746227"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I think I broke the game.<br>
I've been playing around with Rawr lately and decided to see if it's possible to actually make <i>Pyroblast</i> the mage's main-cast spell for dps. If this were to happen, you'd have to reduce the cast time to 3 seconds, like that of a talented fireball. Then you'd need a shadow priest or two to make up the mana cost difference. But I wanted to do it and <u>remain hit capped.</u> Here's where the fun began.<br>
<br>
<b>Rules I made for myself</b><br>
1. Socket only haste gems to the maximum amount possible. I chose Quick Lionseye because they provide the most haste.<br>
2. Remain hit capped or within .5% of the fire cap.<br>
3. Use any piece of gear from any instance in any combination. If you're going all out, why not take down all the bosses in the game while you're at it.<br>
4. If you cannot gain hit cap from gear, only then did I want to rely on an elemental shaman.<br>
<br>
Here's what I got:<br>
Helm- Hood of Hexing [3x Quick Lionseye] {Glyph of Power enchant}<br>
Neck- Sunfire Pendant [Quick Lionseye]<br>
Shoulder- Amice of the Convoker [2x Quick Lionseye]<br>
Back- Shroud of the Highborne (MAXIMUM HASTE ON A CLOAK ZOMG) {Subtlety enchant}<br>
Chest- Sunfire Robe [3x Quick Lionseye] {+6 stats enchant}<br>
Wrist- Bracers of Nimble Thought {15 spell damage enchant}<br>
Gloves- Gloves of Tyri's Power [2x Quick Lionseye] {15 spell hit rating enchant}<br>
Waist- Belt of the Tempest [Quick Lionseye]<br>
Legs- Leggings of Calamity [3x Quick Lionseye] {Runic Spellthread}<br>
Feet- Boots of the Tempest [Quick Lionseye] {Vitality enchant}<br>
Weapon(s)- Grand Magister's Staff of Torrents [3x Quick Lionseye] {Sunfire enchant}<br>
Ranged- Wand of the Demonsoul [Quick Lionseye]<br>
Trinkets- Skull of Gul'dan and Quagmirran's Eye<br>
<br>
TOTALS WITH ONLY AI and MOLTEN ARMOR:<br>
8203 Health<br>
10736 Mana<br>
<br>
22.32% spell crit (245 crit rating)<br>
<b>547 Spell haste rating</b><br>
1198 Fire spell damage<br>
<b>164 Spell hit rating</b><br>
<br>
Now with an ele shaman, you could use Blade of Twisted Visions and Heart of the Pit for more haste and change your glove enchant to damage.<br>
<br>
I don't know the conversions of haste (1 rating = ??%) but I'm pretty sure 547 haste would be close enough to make pyroblast viable. Comments?<br>
<br>
<br>
P.S. I'm not a math god, I'm horrible at theorycrafting. So any replies limited in math or with long, drawn-out explanations to the math wold be appreciated.<br>
<br>
/EDIT: My spell damage math is off, I forgot to remove the Flask of Pure Death in Rawr. It should be 1118 fire damage. My bad.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>You realise that with a 3 second pyroblast, you'd have a 1.5 second fireball?<br>
To make Pyroblast spam viable, it would need a 1 second cast time, which is ~7800 haste rating. Good luck getting there <br>
<br>
And even then, Fireball still scales better due to 4T6, Pyroblast is still better due to the higher base damage though.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_746251"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I have a haste-related question (spent some time reading this thread, but can't find the answer). Won't haste-heavy gear setup actually hurt fire mage's DPS due to going OOM fast? <br>
<br>
The point is that ever since 2.3, I've being a haste adept in our guild, and on every good occasion try to tell ppl how good haste is for casters. The question I asked is an argument against haste that one of our guild's mages told me. Would be really great, if you adviced me how to counter this, or actually proved that I am being wrong. Sorry for asking possibly obvious things, but my main and only character is a shadowpriest and I know little to nothing about mages and their mana efifciency. <br>
<br>
From a shadowpriest perspective (I'm an active participant of shadowpriest.com forums), there were lots or arguments against haste, with most popular being: ruining rotations and lowering mana efficiency. However, now both things are not considered to be a problem, and high-end priests are sitting at 200-300 spellhaste. Of course, haste stacking spawns some less obvious issues, e.g. 1 haste vs 1dmg usefullness ratio decay with increasing haste values, but these are unnecessary details in the context of my original question.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

But irrelevant ; decurse is priority and I thought it was an assumption made by all regarding that fight, prior to b) staying alive by whatever means necesary and c) nuking your tits off when possible.<br>

</div>I do yes, though I wonder whether I should interrupt my casting (especially on the slow as hell frostbolts...) to decurse sooner. I take on-board your point that the curses is announced but timers can be off, and I'd much rather have the option of interrupting or continuining a 1.5 second cast than a 3 second cast. I fail to see how being 1 second into a fireball and 1 second into an AB and having a curse land on your partner is anything other than MUCH better for the arcane mage. Half a second and I'm decursing, having cast ; there is much less of a decision? As fire I would walk out of the cast in this situation, probably.<br>

</div>Can only agree with that - and I've said restacking AB is an issue - however - have u never had more than one mage had to bandage in a fight? (Risking scorch fall off) -- In world of theorycraft no the scorch debuff shouldn't fall off - and generally we have several fire mages keeping it up (yes this is lower over dps but only fractionally) ; but if it does, the dps loss while its stack and during the time its off, its a huge difference to anyone doing fire damage in the raid, not just the mages. The point remains that if AB falls off ; we can make up the difference because during the time we've been - getting a CR, getting bandaged, iceblocking to save our ass etc - we have regenned mana. Fire has no way to make up lost time - because as you have said many times ; you have no mana issues. Which means for every fight you will almost <i>ever</i> play as fire, you're chain casting the whoooole time. This means that if you get death and decayed, then have to bandage, then have to iceblock and somehow, through bad luck, the same has happened to other mages, and scorch falls off - a) you've got oodles more mana that you cannot use (arcane can) and b) dps loss caused by all mages hastily restacking scorch (x3 to be sure, x4 perhaps if they're looking at other things) is far outweighed by delay in restacking AB debuff, primarily because we can then make use of the regenned mana with more AB spam. (which on Rage isn't really an issue - altho with molten armor on Rage I still got outdamaged by a rogue so I need to work out how that happened)<br>

</div>Manly I have a lot of respect for you, so I'm going to blame the way that I have written it not anything else. But I do not know how you are misunderstanding me ; but I can only explain it better. When I say "gives him more mana than he can spend" I mean exactly that you do NOT have mana issues. Quite the contrary. I never used to need to evocate as fire, I never used to really need to remake my gems, I never used to really need to use mana pots on every CD (though I did perhaps due to poor SPs or lack of them). I even spent a day with Dr Boom a loooong time ago (back when I was only reading EJ and not posting in the middle of last year) having regemmed from crit to damage gems and back again, with molten and with mage - to see whether the mana returns from crit were worthwhile. I understand fire, and I know that you cannot spend the blue stuff. I have never, and until something drastic changes, will never think that fire has a mana problem. <br>
<br>
OK?<br>
Now ; the problem that you lot (and I will do when I hit 4xT6 and Sunwell progression) have is that you cannot make use of incoming mana. Arcane mages can. By potting, using evocation and gems productively, we can turn all the incoming mana into reduced threat damage. You cannot. If you finish a boss with half a mana bar - that is mana that an arcane mage would have been able to make use of. Whether you have done more or less damage than him is irrelevant for the moment. I was frustrated with ALWAYS having mana left at the end of a boss fight, and my instincts telling me that a mana dump such as AB could be put to use here.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Fire mages have trinkets, drums, molten fury (yes, this is a cooldown for all means and purposes), combustion, icy veins, bloodlust, flame cap and destruction potion. Thats a lot more than just combustion and icy veins. And on the contrary to your claim, I believe that fire mages are better suited to fit any situation than an arcane mage for the simple reason that we have a stronger and more flexible arsenal of spells. I'm talking {arcane blast, frostbolt and arcane explosion <b>[EDIT _ JaMMi_ Arcane power, presence of mind, cold snap} </b>vs {scorch, fireball, fireblast, dragon's breath, blastwave, arcane explosion}. <br>
I am not denying that having a 1.5s cast time main spell has its advantages, but it won't magically make you the most flexible by virtue of having a short cast time. I am not arguing about threat - in my experience it has rarely been an issue save on eredar twins reverse order.</div>

</div>Now we're getting to the issue of how to spend that mana. Drums, haste on gear, heroism ; all facilitate the spending of that spare mana that we all agree fire mages have. In fact heroism to be honest is a hindrance to me because it gives me less regen time for the time same amount of damage. I mostly pop AB/trinket and frosbolt spam during heroism, with an AB thrown in to keep the debuff up, knowing that after the heroism I'll be back to having to manage the regen that for the rest of the fight I've been used to. Heroism is a dream to fire mages because it lets them spend the mana reserves they have. Without it, you are subpar. The same is not true of an arcane mage without a shadowpriest PRE-sunwell, PRE-4xT6.<br>

</div>Arcane is TOTALLY not restricted to popping its cooldowns during bloodlust. In fact the whole beauty and beast of the arcane spec is knowing when to popping cooldowns ; and believe me ; heroism is a kick in the face when they are not available and/or you need regen time. FIRE is the spec that must keep its cooldowns for heroism ; and must beg the shamans to do it significantly later into the start of a fight due to threat (which you never had an issue with, perhaps, but the rest of us do) OR at sub-20%. <br>
Which basically says ; arcane is better for progressing with bosses because until you get below 20% we are subpar. Not once have I heard a raid leader say (Get him to 20% lads then its easy mode because the mages execute).<br>
<br>
The fact is that I as arcane am constantly watching my mana and the raids mana - When i see the opportunity to AB spam with AP up - (SP is having a good day at the office and somehow my mana bar is staying fairly constant even though I'm AB spamming and have been since the start of the fight ; I know I've got mana pot and mana gem off've cooldown and I can afford to lose the mana from AB/AP/trinket spam with icy veins up) - I do it. This is rare. Mostly I will start AB spamming and watch my mana, then use icy veins (the first of two) with AP and trinket - and do something like 9:1 AB:FrB so that I can see how much my mana drops, whilst maintaining AB debuff, and also seeing how my mana bar  drops. If heroism suddenly goes off ; I'll switch to something like 1AB:5FrB but again the ratio will change depending on how close I am to a pot cooldown.<br>
<br>
I am wracking my brain trying to think of a way of process-flowing the way a true arcane mage manages the abilities he has available ; and I can only guess is something akin to the hunter timelines and squeezing abilities into certain time slots.<br>
<br>
The start of a fight I have mana pot cd, mana gem cd and evocate available = high mana useage mode.<br>
As soon as possible, I use mana pot, then gem ; both of which ideally return me to approximately 99% mana (ish).<br>
Within this time, depending on movement, (as you say it affects us, but not as MUCH as fire - Ill explain I hope), having to use pom while moving, having to avoid using AP due to risk of being feared / stunned / silenced etc - my mana regen could be very high (If SP hasn't had to move, im within range of totems, heroism hasn't been used etc) or it could be very low. If its very low, I will be in a situation where I have to consider the fact that I have no mana pot for a while, no mana gem for a while, and I don't really want to use evocate so quickly into the fight. I also have cold snap off cd and ideally I want it on cd asap so that it can come off again sooner. (Again iceblock being used adds weight to the use of cold snap early argument ; so the difference between getting incinerate at Teron, early on, makes the decision to use Cold Snap an easy one).<br>
<br>
I'm going to try and think of a way to explain the arcane thought processes behind all this as I continue to raid using this spec. Education &gt; all... And only when we're on the same page can we correctly debate it. At the moment you guys truly do not understand AB/FrB raiding ; and how it affects your gear choice (I recently swapped from +40 damage on weapon to +30 int ; not because rawr told me it did more damage, but because in the event of lacking an SP I want to know the regen is there, and when a SP IS present, I can easily convert extra incoming mana into damage. Also using intellect to boost by AB spam uptime reduces my threat overall. Using frostbolt fillers causes too much threat during AP/trinket/icy veins spam phases), which I'm sorry but you guys are really behind in your understanding.<br>
<br>
I exist in a world where I get Anetheron's Noose drop, and though rawr tells me the higher dps gems for it are +12x2, I choose to use +10int and +10 spirit because they're second best (1.7 dps behind on the comparison chart) but with the former I get higher threat lower regen (more FrB uptime due to lower overall mana) and with the latter I get more regen (= more AB uptime, more regen during run phases [Supremus/Archi], more options available perhaps on the really arcane favoured fights [like Supremus] to use molten armor and have no mana issues] etc etc etc.<br>
<br>
And ; to get back to the tongue-in-cheek baiting ; 3k dps on MH trash last night [10 million damage, 3k dps average] ; beat that fire boys! [Proviso ; Perhaps these pointless elements of banter merely serve to make me look like a plonker, and detract from the serious dicussion I'm trying to evolve and develop above.. however... I find myself unable to resist trying to elicit at least a wry smile from the mages who I've come to respect so much on these forums... Please.. just "lol" and ignore them :P]<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>No - actually its a significant boost.<br>
If you regularly group with mage's that are fire (2/48/11 is what they should be) and would experience mana problems (mana problems for fire = being low on mana at any point really, except as Manly mentioned on Morogrim when they have to AoE [lacking clearcasting]) if they stacked haste ; then <br>
a) You're not doing your job as shadowpriest [ let's assume you are because you're here asking to help them! = &lt;3]<br>
b) They are not using mana potions when they're off cooldown [ Which is a nice trade-off really ; Stack haste, use pot ; or don't stack haste and not need to -- basically its paying for pots,  to do more damage]<br>
c) They're not remaking their 3x mana emerald mid-fight. This has been said mulitple times to be the better option than using the lower rank mana gems.<br>
<br>
That's pretty much it really.<br>
<br>
As fire, mana is never really an issue. Haste is fantastic for a fire mage because it gives them the opportunity to turn spare mana ; into damage. <br>
<br>
The only suggestion I would make, is that they do not simply re-gem to improve haste count; but create a new set with hasted gear items. If they stack haste as much as possible, and you're not available to raid, then perhaps, perhaps ( depending on how extreme they go) they might experience issues ; but I'd be very surprised.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Sorry to take you away from the unending Arcane vs Fire arguments, but I've seen you say this before, Manly, and I'm interested to know what you assume to make this judgment. The reason I ask is that my guild killed Illidan for the first time a month ago (so we normally do better than the examples I'm about to give) and I ran OOM on a pretty poor Teron kill last night that went for over six minutes. This is clearly not a regular lasting Teron fight but I potted twice, gemmed once, used a full 10 second evocate and used a flame cap near the end (before everyone started dying and we limped through to a kill - of course I had planned for a shorter fight and ended up OOM 30 seconds before the kill due to the flame cap). <b>I did not have a shadow priest or a resto shaman, </b>only a moonkin. The mana issues were hardly isolated to this fight - on Naj'entus I gemmed twice, potted twice, and got half an evocate during a shield <i>with</i> a shadow priest and still OOMed a few seconds before the end. This fight lasted a little over 5 minutes.</div>

	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>That's all you need to know as your answer to the question of "how can you say you have no mana issues?".<br>
<br>
Fire is clean cut and simple in that it (a) either has an SP and does not have a mana issue or (b) does not have an SP and can't cope or (c) has some other mana source that isn't an SP and barely copes, but has to select some form of regen over some form of dps, depending on occasion (ie, gems over caps, pots over d-pots etc.)<br>
<br>
As for the gentleman who came up with "I see many mages on WoW forums and this one" could you please amend your oppinion to "many morons on wow forums, and some who nobody cares about on this one". Manly correctly identifies: You're all going amok about arcane-hating, which doesn't exist in EJ, and then spewing any and every excuse you can find to "defend" it against some immaginary assault. <br>
<br>
This thread is starting to feel like getting on the bus and seeing a man with a chainsaw and a crazy look sit opposite you going "I'ma readeh for yeh". The only people worked-up and seemingly inexhaustibly aggressive are the pro-arcane posters fighting their crusade against a non-existent threat, while the vast majority of us not only acknowledge arcane as viable and preferential, occasionally superior to fire in certain aspects, but moreover DON'T CARE for comparing the specs, because largely IT'S IRRELEVANT. We can all perfectly well see Pushback, CD stacking, OO5SR, Range and all the other bullshit that we keep seeing mega-posts about our selves, thanks.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_746548"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Back to the pyroblast discussion.<br>
<br>
Okay, we've thrown out pyroblast spam completely. Now how about using all the gear listed above and doing the normal scorch/fireball rotation until Bloodlust or IV and then spamming pyroblast? I'm not sure on the math for this one, either, but if you stack both of them, you'd have maybe a 1.7ish cast time on Pyroblast compared to the GCD-locked fireball. Wouldn't it be that the base-bonus damage of pyro would outweigh the fireball?<br>
<br>
And don't use the 4T6 argument, since it's irrelevant in this gear set-up. I'm asking if you were actualy crazy enough to stack this much haste and compare the two.<br>
<br>
P.S. Alliance mages can stack up to 570 haste gear and remain hit capped with a draenei ele shaman. Horde cannot, sadly.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Ok so, in short, you're telling me that arcane wins out whenever its doing something that isn't dps because it regens more mana and has more opportunity to take advantage of that. Well, I knew that. Again, all that this is saying is 'all specs work differently, arcane does a better job when not dpsing [than the other specs]'.<br>
<br>
Also, all specs are reliant on bloodlust, for the simple reason that <b>bloodlust increases your DPS and DPM</b>. It increases DPM indirectly by virtual of allowing more casts while under other cooldowns, such as hex shrunken head, or molten fury. As such, arcane is reliant on it. Good luck proving me wrong on that. (I mean it)<br>
<br>
A minor detail:<br>
<i>"EDIT _ JaMMi_ Arcane power, presence of mind, cold snap"</i><br>
Those don't apply. POM is not flexible because it is on cooldown, and AP/CS doesn't affect the flexibility of your spells. If you were to include those, I would include combustion since technically its an awesome AOE tool, but it doesn't really help at all my flexibility.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic"> does anyone else feel severely hampered by the new spell queue system? I do not trust it especially during times of excessive haste (close to, on, or below the 1 second gcd) and rather than be duped into thinking I'm casting 1 second casts and actually (through the magic of server/client confusion) be given 1.05 or 1.1 second casts - I'd rather switch to other spells that avoid getting the "That spell is not ready yet" error. I never like to let my client think for itself, and hence still use quartz (and for some things like ice lance, for farming) a stopcast macro.<br>
Or.. conversely... from some decent testing... has it been shown to correctly work in all scenarios and actually be the basis for a caster revolution in terms of not needing quartz/stopcasting?</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>The mechanic is not actually a spell queuing system, per se.  How it works is they unlocked your client to be able to send cast messages to the server all the time without any interference of the GCD or the client limiting when the messages could be sent.  This means that using /stopcasting is most likely a loss of dps since you get a better effect by merely spamming the button near where Quartz shows your latency to be and you get the exact same result that /stopcasting used to give without the possibility of interrupting a cast before it completes.<br>
<br>
If you want to time your casts you can always do so but, and this especially true when hasted near the 1.0 second cast time, you are better off doing the spam thing since then your message is more likely to be at the server the moment the server determines that it is eligible to cast the next spell.<br>
<br>
They did seem to add a small amount of leeway to the system as well where it does not count as a queue but where the server will accept messages a little bit prior to the actual end of the casting time, but that is more about smoothing out the mechanic for people who prefer to hit the button once as opposed to spamming it.  This leeway is probably in the realm of 50ms and as far as I know has never been definitively tested for or proven but is more anecdotal in existence, based on a post from the UI developer and just from how seamless the system currently functions under most circumstances.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">They did seem to add a small amount of leeway to the system as well where it does not count as a queue but where the server will accept messages a little bit prior to the actual end of the casting time, but that is more about smoothing out the mechanic for people who prefer to hit the button once as opposed to spamming it.  This leeway is probably in the realm of 50ms and as far as I know has never been definitively tested for or proven but is more anecdotal in existence, based on a post from the UI developer and just from how seamless the system currently functions under most circumstances.</div>

</div>As far as I know there is no spellqueue. However, I did see some apalling results pointing towards having one of sort. If only there existed one sure-fire way to test this. Maybe someone with 10-15ms connection and a G15 ? In any case, if there is a spell queue, the window of opportunity for chain cast value is set rather low, probably around the 50ms you have hinted (which is somewhat stupid when you think about it -- thats faster than most players press keys).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I think that this is consistent with what I've been seeing. I'm still not 100% I trust it though. For example today I walked out of a cast to pom sheep something and it took a ridiculous amount of time for pom to register. It was like the server/client conversation went something like this (again in Jam language):<br>
"I want to cast arcane blast"<br>
"Ok well, have a gcd"<br>
"Please wait towards the end of my arcane blast I need you to accept my next spell ; oh wait I've cancelled - await further instructions"<br>
"Ok so you want me to wait at the end of your arcane-"<br>
"POM please"<br>
"No wait hold up what did you say before? Oh you cancelled your arc - ohhh you want to POM"<br>
<br>
Very annoying. I'm not sure if I prefer the old system to the new one to be honest. <br>
<br>
On a different note - (One which if they have to fix one of these two issues I'd rather they fix this one first...)<br>
I definitely am getting frustrated with the stacking bug. In heroics I find myself just frostbolting for the purity of knowing your next cast isn't going to cost more mana than it should relative to the cast time. I suppose I can only hope that the Dev's do see it as a genuine bug and can look to rectify it shortly.<br>
A simple work-around they could use would be to get the client to send the message, when AB is cast, "haste all subsequent spells by &lt;insert relevant AB haste factor here&gt; ; if the next spell you receive is not AB ; initiate a suitable delay before permitting the next cast. ie ; the AB debuff becomes a global haste / global delay function... and if you for some reason get a hasted scorch (or whatever) as a result - then you simply get a delay after it has registered and your next cast is permissable.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the info on the spell relationship since 2.3 though.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Back to the pyroblast discussion.<br>
<br>
Okay, we've thrown out pyroblast spam completely. Now how about using all the gear listed above and doing the normal scorch/fireball rotation until Bloodlust or IV and then spamming pyroblast? I'm not sure on the math for this one, either, but if you stack both of them, you'd have maybe a 1.7ish cast time on Pyroblast compared to the GCD-locked fireball. Wouldn't it be that the base-bonus damage of pyro would outweigh the fireball?<br>
<br>
And don't use the 4T6 argument, since it's irrelevant in this gear set-up. I'm asking if you were actualy crazy enough to stack this much haste and compare the two.<br>
<br>
P.S. Alliance mages can stack up to 570 haste gear and remain hit capped with a draenei ele shaman. Horde cannot, sadly.</div>

Your setup has 1118 fire damage. Makes ... 1358 raid buffed?<br>
Fireball/Pyroblast both scale with 115%.<br>
<br>
Fireball thus does 735+1.15*1358 = 2297 damage, Pyroblast does 1065+1.15*1358 = 2627 damage.<br>
<br>
If Pyroblast is to be better than Fireball, Fireball will have a 1.0s cast time limit (the GCD) doing 2297 DPS (before modifiers), and Pyro thus has to cast faster than 2627/2297*1s = 1.1437 seconds.<br>
<br>
So, Pyro is only useful if you drop below 1.15s cast time for it, which requires +422% haste.<br>
With IV/Bloodlust, you'd need +235% haste from gear, or around 3680 haste rating. Enjoy collecting <!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div><br>
First off the tongue-in-cheek baiting is completely unnecessary and really does make you look like a "plonker".  It doesn't elicit a wry smile, it elicits an annoyed groan and really frustrates any attempts to take what you say at all seriously.<br>
<br>
Secondly I was Arc/Frost for long enough to have gone through MH that way and to see every fight up through the Twins as that spec and in regards to the AoE trash in MH the key to topping the meters (as if it really mattered anyway) was not being Arc/Frost but more about who did the first AE.  I was the only Arc/Frost mage running with 2 Fire mages and during trash we all alternated around the top 5 spots but none of it mattered anyway.<br>
<br>
There are only 2 real advantages to being Arc/Frost.   That's it, only 2, and they are not the shorter casting times, not freedom to move more, not being able to drain your mana faster, the only advantages whatsoever that it brings is that it doesn't require 3 debuff slots per mage to do it's dps and that it doesn't require CoE to be truly competitive.<br>
<br>
That's not a small advantage, btw, in an already crowded aspect of the game not needing COE and not using any debuff slots gives other classes opportunities to apply more debuffs and that gives the spec it's validity.  Ask the rogues how much they like having to pull off deadly poison to conserve debuff slots.  Too bad so many mages are limited to looking at the meters to see how their personal performance is not how they are aiding the raid as a whole.<br>
<br>
So then it comes down to a determination of which is more important, properly supporting the Arc/Frost mage by giving him the mana to be competitive and then making use of the debuff slots freed up, or having a mage that doesn't require anywhere near the same amount of support to be viable but who uses up 3 precious debuff slots to do their dps.  As for what is better at that point in the discussion is completely between the individual mage and their raid leader and the raid as a whole.<br>
<br>
<br>
Final note, there is a new Arcane mage TC thread, discussions of Arcane viability should probably be moved over to there.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_746883"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Good day to all,<br>
<br>
As an avid reader of those boards i would like to remind you of the influence you guys have over the mage community. It might not be my place to say this, and i know this post has nothing to do with TC but I think it is still worth reminding all of you.<br>
<br>
Most of us, will not see the content you guys have on farm, for that matter most of us don't even have the resources necessary to get there, you are the elite of the raiding community. So when you guys say the fire spec doesn't have mana issues, or that it is the best raid dps spec bar non for high end raiding the people that read these boards forget that all those calculations are made under close to optimal circumstances and roll with that. It then trickles down to the wow mage forums and into the forums of various lower guilds and all the nuances you guys take for granted are forgotten.<br>
<br>
<br>
As an example i would like to mention a recent argument I had with another mage from my guild recently (3 bosses dead in MH and BT). He was arguing that i was wasting my time with arcane/frost because i could do more damage with fire and he started to quote these boards and sent me various links to your discussions and so on. But what he failed to realize is that for almost all of you guys 4 pieces of tier 6 is a given as well as a SP and COE not to mention bloodlust at 20% and the list goes on. But for a guild like ours who only has 1 elemental shamman and a single SP reserved for healers as well as 2 semi-selfish locks (cor and cos only) things are not optimal and the edge a fire mage gets with all of these vs an arcane one is lost. Even worse he ends up going oom more often than i because he can't go into mana preservation mode but I can so he ends up having a better dps but i end having more damage done when that happens.<br>
<br>
So please keep that in mind when you guys duel over which spec does what, i know there are various help pls threads for the mage noob, i read them all, but isn't it customary when you publish results from researches to describe under what circumstances those findings were obtained?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

So, Pyro is only useful if you drop below 1.15s cast time for it, which requires +422% haste.<br>
With IV/Bloodlust, you'd need +235% haste from gear, or around 3680 haste rating. Enjoy collecting </div>

</div>That's not exactly true.  This is the number you would need for Pyroblast *spam* to be effective, so you get no DOT ticks.  With this level of spell damage, you would get a DPS boost if you could get Pryo to about 1.4-1.5 sec cast.  The trick would be to pyro, then fireball until the pyro DOT runs out, then pyro again.  So you only need about ~2500 haste + IV/BL to for Pyroblast to have a use in raids.<br>
<br>
Comedy aside, Pyroblast is just a stupidly designed spell.  It should have a base cast of 4.5 and probably also a bigger scaling on the DOT damage (35%, up from 20%).  Then it would occasionally make sense to rotate it in with your fireballs and let the DOT.  It wouldn't break anything since the rare situations in which it is useful now (POM, Zul'jin phase 3, pulling a mage tank target, pulling when solo/leveling) are the ones in which cast time is pretty much irrelevant - it would hardly get better in these circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is in no danger of ever being spammable.  Even with both of my changes, Pyro rotation just barely beats fireball spam if you get a full run of the DOT *and* your spell damage is not too high.  And, no, this does not change for any possible amount of haste.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_747289"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->So I assume it's safe for us to say Pyroblast should never be used in a non-arcane mage's raiding cycles. A shame Blizzard made it suck so badly, it would really be an amazing spell if it were a shorter cast time.  Oh well. Going back to the gear set-up above (Sorry to keep dragging you guys back to this), how's it stack up against 4T6? I don't exactly know the math, but I've read a few times that haste = ~1.25 spell damage. So if you swapped out all the Lionseyes to Reckless Pyrestones, couldn't this set-up possibly be comparable to 4T6? Or no?<br>

		<div id="post_message_748030"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->In response to the Pyroblast line of reasoning, it may be viable to use Pyro as the last spell as haste cooldowns are running out if you won't need to use Evo at that point.  I did the math a while ago and dismissed it, but I think that was before Icy Veins. You're looking at Pyro on one hand, taking 6 / (1 + haste%) time and a Fireball and fractional Fireball on the other hand in the same amount of time.  The number of Fireballs you get in the same time as the hasted Pyro is (1 + 1 / (1 + haste)) unless I've made a major error.  (The cast time constants drop out cause Pyro is 6s and Fireball 3s.)<br>
<br>
If the spell coefficient thread is right for 1.35 as the Pyro coefficient (I had thought it was 6/3.5, maybe it got nerfed when I wasn't looking.), then it looks like you'd need 88% bonus haste about to fade to make hasted Pyro worthwhile over a hasted Fireball and partial normal Fireball.  It might be 87% or a tad lower if you count the extra tick or two from the previous Fireball, so even with IV/PI/Heroism all synced to run out at the same time, it'd basically be a wash.  I ran those numbers with 1200 +damage; you only need more haste as you go up.<br>
<br>
Edit: found a bug where the base damage from the Pyro DoT was double-counted.  Correcting that brings the break-even point up to 168-169% from the expiring haste buffs, which is very much not possible at the moment.  Counting the differing amount of Fireball ticks between the two, the break-even point is around 159-160% haste.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>None of this matters much.  Non-POM pyroblast is a huge DPS loss with or without your corrections.  With your numbers, Fireball is about 44% better DPS than Pyroblast (assuming full ticks).<br>
<br>
At the end of a big haste effect - say 30% Bloodlust - you need to compare 1 hasted pyro to 1 hasted fireball + 76% of a second unhasted fireball (that's how much haste time you are "losing" by not using the pyro).<br>
<br>
If the pyroblast has a base DPS of X:<br>
<br>
1) One hasted Pyro dps = 1.3X<br>
2) One hasted Fireball + 75 of an unhasted = [(1.44 * 1.3X) + (1.44 X * 0.76)] / 1.76 = 1.68 X<br>
<br>
Even at the end of Bloodlust staying with Fireball spam is 1.68/1.3 = 129% the damage of mixing in a single Pyro.  In order for this trick to improve DPS you need to drop your spelldam to +190.  I'm not kidding - one hundred ninety.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I accidentally double-counted the base damage of the Pyro DoT before, and even that small (356) amount of damage completely changed the picture from being reasonable in extreme situations (87% ish) to being completely unreasonable (159% or more).  I also updated the figures above and included the differing amount of Fireball ticks you get between the two.<br>
<br>
The crit thing was a good call since the DoTs are relevant.  When I add in 40% crit on both sides of the DD and up the +damage to 1500, the break-even point is 271-272% haste from buffs, as if it weren't already impossible enough.  (Fireball is well capped to 1s GCD by this point)<br>
<br>
So there we go, now if someone asks me if it's better to use that final cast of BL/IV/PI for Pyro over Fireball, I can point them to the numbers.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Not reliably. It's the same reason behind the whole discussion on the Rolling Ignites. And because I forget, do buffed instants get a 1.5s GCD or 1s GCD? But anyways, a G15 might help here, not sure.<br>

</div>Hey Ossi. While the argument of A/F vs Fire is probably the hottest one at the moment (not the most clever tho), and i have to agree with you that sometimes people just read what favours their points, AND ultimately that A/F has different (probably harder) mechanics than fire, possibly making it funnier for some people (like me)...<br>
...i have to say you are completely mistaken about this thread (i think we could even just say EJ forums). People don't come here and discuss about TC with others in order to teach the masses how to play mage. It's not a matter of showing off who's the most clever/witty/know-it-al/whatever mage. They come here to compare their knowledge and refine it in order to get closer to "complete knowledge".<br>
<br>
In other words, you are allowed to read, and to give your imput. But it's not up to you to decide in which way people should contribute (if we exclude, of course, forum guidelines).<br>
<br>
PS: Most caring posters on these boards usually refer to something only after it's been proven with both theories and empirical evidences. Sometimes it's hard to spot the reference, but after some time you'll get to know where they are taking their words from.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Using Rawr with my gear and my stanadard Brutallus setting. I'm hitcapped (0.12% above) with Zhar'doom, and nearly capped (-0.19% below) with Tempest/Chronicle without Precision (or without ToW).<br>
<br>
<b>Comparison with all consumables allowed</b><br>
<br>
2/47/11 - 2283 DPS with Zhar'doom with 2 pots, 1.74 gems, 0.06 Evocations. 2268 DPS with Temp/Chron (and far over cap) using 2 mana pots and 1.43 mana gems.<br>
<br>
33/28/0 - 2215 DPS with Temp/Chro (0.19% below cap, that's a ~4 DPS loss compared to being capped), using no mana pots, no gems, no evocation and doing Fireball/Fire Blast for 181 seconds.<br>
<br>
It uses pure fireball spam during cooldowns (135 seconds), fireball spam for another 43.64 seconds, and then fireball/fire blast rotations for 181.36 seconds.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Comparison without Destruction Potions and Flame Caps</b><br>
<br>
Removing Destruction Potions and Flame Caps from the list of allowed buffs, it looks like this:<br>
2/47/11 - 2255 DPS with Zhar'doom, 2235 DPS with Temp/Chro (and far beyond hit capped).<br>
33/28/0 - 2169 DPS with Tempest/Cronicle.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Scaling Comparison</b><br>
<br>
Scaling of 33/28 is as follows:<br>
10 haste = 11.76 DPS, 10 crit = 9.45 DPS, 12 damage = 10.74 DPS, 10 int = 4.03 DPS, 10 spi = 0.69 DPS, 4 mp5 = 0.64 DPS.<br>
<br>
For comparison, 2/47/11 with Zhar'doom scales as follows:<br>
10 haste = 10.86 DPS, 10 crit = 8.17 DPS, 12 damage = 12.13 DPS, 10 int = 3.64 DPS, 10 spi = 0.00 DPS, 4 mp5 = 1.46 DPS.<br>
<br>
The scaling with haste is a bit better because there is more mana to burn.<br>
Crit scales better due to spell power, I expected crit to be a lot better though.<br>
The scaling with spell damage is worse because Empowered Fireball is missing.<br>
<br>

In terms of raw DPS, it's 4% behind fire/IV.<br>
<br>
It deals less damage but has much more free mana to burn. This allows the use of more Destruction Potions and Flame Caps, but they only add slightly more damage.<br>
33/28/0 gains 46 DPS from full pots/gems, while 2/47/11 gains  28-33 DPS from partial pot/gem use.<br>
<br>
Accounting for the more liberal use of DPS pots/gems, it is still 3% behind fire/IV.<br>
<br>
The difference shrinks to 1.7% if you remove the shadow priest.<br>
<br>
Serpent-Coil Braid is shown as pretty bad because the spec already has "too much mana".<br>
<br>
<br>
The spec probably isn't as bad as its reputation, but I don't really see it's use.<br>
It's a slightly weaker fire spec with better AoE capabilities and I'd say comparable burst capabilities (AP + PoMPyro vs. IV/Comb + 15% better scaling with +damage from DPot/FCap/Trinket).<br>
If AoE matters, you're probably better off going 40 Arcane, and if it doesn't, your normal spec (Fire/Fireball or Arcane/Arcane Blast) is the better choice.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Edit</b><br>
// Going with full Sunwell gear, 33/28 overtakes 2/47/11.<br>
// 33/28 - 2805 DPS with Illidan hat, T6 gloves, Chronicle, using no mana consumables, no Fire Blast either.<br>
<br>
Edit: I forgot to remove Mind Mastery in the spec. Doh. Same situation in end sunwell gear, fixed the numbers.<br>
<br>
33/28 - 2621 DPS with Illidan hat, T6 gloves, Chronicle, using no mana consumables, using 0.92 seconds of Fireball/Fire Blast rotation.<br>
2/47/11 - 2730 DPS with T6 hat, Sunfire gloves, Heart of the Pit, using 1 mana pot, 2 mana gems, 0.04 Evocations.<br>
<br>
(This models the M'uru trinket as 240 damage for 20s every 2 minutes. It is actually 320 damage for 15 seconds every 2 minutes, allowing for better cooldown stacking. It shouldn't make a major difference though.)<br>
<br>
I am using the old Rawr though (13.1) because I didn't want to remake my itemlist (new/unknown loot and better gems). So, someone might want to double check things.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Major problem there. b14 had lots of fixes for mage calculations. You probably need to redo these comparisons in b14. You can use your b13 itemcache just fine, just copy it into the b14 folder. Same with characters, enchants, buffs, etc.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">The point of Rawr.mage is that it calculates optimal spell cycles and estimated dps based on your exact gear and precise fight parameters. It does tend to overestimate, but that can be easily remedied by setting the latency option to a more realistic value. As with any modelling tool: garbage in, garbage out. I.e. if you just start it up, load your character from the armory and expect it to tell you which spec is best, that's not going to happen.<br>
<br>
What Rawr doesn't do, that humans tend to, is make vague and generalised comparisons without considering any particular raiding level, and post these under the pretense of scientific evaluation in a theorycrafting thread.</div>

</div>So, if i understood correctly, the spec in question scales better with haste and crit than standart fire, but the loss in +dam scaling makes it lose out in the end where single-target dps is concerned. In return, it has stronger AE spam.<br>
<br>
If this is the case, it might be a decent spec for MH raider who somehow didn't manage to get his hands on 2xt5. But that's about the only scenario i can think of <!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Since you ask... <br>
<br>
At the start of your first post, you did exactly that: you dissed our beloved Rawr.mage without providing any specifics on why you don't trust it. I found your post ironic enough to feel compelled to respond. The judgement mistake was to use the word 'mathcraft' and then just list the talent differences between the two specs. Specifically: you didn't actually do any math, while saying you were a big fan of number crunching, but not trusting Rawr.mage which is by definition a number cruncher.<br>
<br>
For example. Stuff like "So we can conclude Molten Fury and AP/PoM cancel each other out" is spurious. One is 20% for duration X, while the other is 30% for duration Y. Not forgetting one affects mana consumption as well. Depends on the fight, depends on gear, etc. These are things that Rawr can tell you, if you take the time to configure it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Thank you for your feedback.<br>
<br>
I apologise if any people that use and love rawr were offended. I assure you it was not my intention.<br>
I recently read that the rawr version which i used back when i tried it out had mistakes in mage formulas.<br>
Maybe the latest version will be able to provide me with more plausible results.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_754785"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Since the new pieces off of Kil'jeaden have been datamined (the ones with warlock / firemage stats) I thought I would run a complete check of which of the 5 old t6 pieces to keep.  My comparison was merely a stat -&gt; spelldmg equivalence using a value of 12 spell damage for sockets (since no setup has more than 2 blues and yellow ~= red).<br>
<br>
Hit comparisons done using next best option method, 5 hit = 6 dmg via gemming. (this also allows me to be neutral with 12dmg / socket comparisons)<br>
Haste comparison using 1 dmg = 0.8 haste (end sunwell gear)<br>
Crit comparison done using 1 dmg = 1.2 crit<br>
It also uses int - crit conversion and adds that in.<br>
<br>
<img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080528142807im_/http://img519.imageshack.us/img519/4073/oldt6fw6.png" border="0" alt=""><br>
<br>
Looks like t6 chest wins by a good margin unless I've made a glaring error. (the number on the right is all the stats converted to spelldmg)  <br>
<br>
Given this method isn't quite as accurate as simply making the entire gearset and figuring out the dps by swapping out the pieces, but this was just some quick work and I think the 10 dmg gap is enough to say which is better.  If you use normal hit equivalency instead of next best option the chest just comes out further ahead.  The only possible downside is that the chest setup has the least stamina. (obviously this is for non-tailors also since sunfire chest would add 22 spelldmg in equivalence putting t6 chest setup at the bottom)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

This gear would put you on 159 Spellhit so with using 1 Veiled Pyrestone in a yellow socket ( wand would be a nice idea ) you can reach the perfect hitcap without getting any raidhelp at all.

</div>What. No, the reason the 40 haste from Battlemaster's Alacrity is not nearly as good as Hex Head is because the Battlemaster on-use is useless from a DPS perspective. M'uru's trinket has lots of haste <b>and</b> an incredibly powerful on-use.<br>
<br>
I think it's generally accepted here that in end game gear, 1 haste rating is roughly equal to 1 damage in terms of increasing DPS. M'uru's trinket has about the same passive haste as Hex Head has passive damage, PLUS having more than 100 extra on-use damage (albeit for a shorter duration), making it an upgrade.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>It's not a shared buff, but it is still better than HSH.<br>

</div>I sure hope not, that would be quite frustrating <br>
<br>
But yeah theres some tidbits that tc misses on. I think the m'uru trinket is interesting, but at the same time I've found it to be somewhat frustrating to use, as is any 15s activations that aren't haste effects. Is it better to cast a fireblast at the tail-end of the 15s ? Or maybe with shifting naaru sliver + destro pot? Its already obvious that you want to refresh your scorch at the tail-end of the buff (or rather, time the activation of trinket so that it times well at the end with scorch refresh). All of this assumes of course that you can't fit an extra fireball at the end, but could fit a scorch.<br>
<br>
But then all of this is further complicated by the fact that depending on the cooldowns used this might not be a good thing. I mean, if you have IV + shifting, is it really worth it to finish off the tail end of shifting with fireblast ? Instinctively I would say that it depends on your passive haste and the number of fireballs you can cast with IV affecting the cast, which may or may not make fireblast worthwhile.<br>
<br>
I need to work out a model to properly evaluate it. I just hope it won't turn into a total mess for a really minor detail.<br>

</div>The buff 'limitless power' is not shared. However, I found an interesting 'feature' of the trinket in its current form. If you activate it, then step out of it, then come back in, you get another 15s stack. Problem is, when you run out of the circle the mechanics are kind of iffy and sometimes it stays on your for 5-10s longer and sometimes 2s. So its kind of not usable in practice, but still, maybe it can possibly be abused. Keep in mind, getting a new 15s limitless power buff will not change the fact that the power circle will die 15s after activating the trinket, which means your new limitless pwoer refresh will not last much longer. <br>
<br>
However, what I don't know, maybe your limitless power doesn't expire as soon as your power circle dies, but rather, as soon as you step out of any* power circle. Let me word it in another way:<br>
<br>
Maybe you could do the following.<br>
Activate trinket. Use for a while. Step out of circle. Let 'limitless power' run out. Run back in your circle for 'limitless power' refresh of 15s. Then get another player activate his own trinket (over you - before your circle dies out). Maybe that will allow you to keep the 15s buff ?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>No. It used to work like that, but it was a bug and quickly fixed in 2.4.2. The item would be ridiculously overpowered if everyone in the raid (or even the group) could get the buff and use it in a rotation.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Like you said as you are alliance you basically "don't need" the hit from the t6 robe but as a horde view of this and taking into account you wouldn't get an elemental shaman horde would either need to go for t6 robe, change ring which means you lose ring of omnipotence or put even more spellhit gems.<br>
<br>
So as for horde (but I have to check it in rawr) the t6 robe should still be superior as we need to get 164 spellhit and alliance only ~152.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>It would be convenient if you had a second one drop next week to test that.  On a side note perhaps the buff has a hidden refresh within the circle - as in some sort of pulse which would refresh the time-to-fade-upon-exit timer.  It seems unlikely that it would be completely random and it would make sense that there is some rule governing said "pulse", though it is entirely speculation.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>So you are claiming that at 395 haste, suddenly the next 5 crit is worth more than the next 5 haste?  Sounds like total nonsense - how do you get this implausible result?<br>
<br>
As near as I can figure, the 395 breakpoint is worth about a 0.25% boost to sustained DPS, while the baseline effect of the haste is over 25%.  The "breakpoint bonus" is actually pretty tiny - it just means that the 395th point of haste is worth about 4 points.  It does not somehow magically trash the value of the 396th point (or any other value).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>That logic is flawed and has been proven wrong in the past here on this forum.<br>
<br>
The simple (non-math) explanation to it is that if you and I do the same rotation (1xSC, 8xFB), then I'll be done faster with the 5 haste extra, so I can restart the cycle faster. <br>
<br>

</div>I agree with you that it isn't practical to roll JC for 2 spelldamage, however if you wanted to be "perfect" you would.  There's a good chance I'm wrong on the JC neck, although I remembered reading it somewhere and wowdb didn't deny it, although looking at wowhead it still says 350 so perhaps I don't know where I got the notion.  Nobody on my server has one for confirmation however.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">The damage/mana post, stuff about Serpent-Coil Braid.<br>
<br>
The braid does have one significant disadvantage though.<br>
- Flame Caps have a 3 minute cooldown, so they will be paired with Combustion/Icy Veins. Mana Gems have a 2 minute cooldown, so the braid proc will usually not be synchronised.<br>
- You also can't use your mana gem right at the start, so the braid can be quite a bit harder to handle when it comes to proper cooldown management. And will most likely lose damage from not stacking cooldowns.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Going back to an old post, from the post 2.3 TC thread, moving it here.<br>
<br>
As you said at the start of the post, in a 6 minute fight, you can use your 3m cooldowns twice and 2m ones three times.<br>
<br>
You ideally want to wait until the last 20% to pop both 3m ones and 2m ones. Assuming the last 20% is 15% of those 6 minutes, you come up with 54 seconds. Pop all CDs at 1:00, 2m ones at 3:00, then all of them at 5:10. You  won't desync your CDs if you use <a class="q1" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=22044" target="_blank">[Mana Emerald]</a>, since you have the buff from braid on your 3m CDs anyway. You can use <a class="q1" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=22788" target="_blank">[Flame Cap]</a>s on the first CD stacking, then mana gem or flame cap on the last one (I'd even go as far as saying mana gems would be better, if you're stacking icy veins, bloodlust, another trinket and drums for the 15 seconds you have the braid buff up, but this is just a hunch and irrelevant for my point :-) ). Using flame caps after a mana gem would be stupid, since you wouldn't be stacking it with icy veins, so if you start with a mana gem you have to go mana gem, mana gem, mana gem or flame cap, and if you start with a flame cap, you have to go flame cap, mana gem or flame cap. It gets tricky and I'm too lazy to do the math, but it basically means one flame cap is actually worth two mana gems and then you're free to pick whichever you want, but which is better depends on what trinkets you stack it (if possible, i.e. not <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=31856" target="_blank">[Darkmoon Card: Crusade]</a>) with.<br>
<br>
Edit: <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32483" target="_blank">[The Skull of Gul'dan]</a> would be a better choice to stack the braid buff with (without Icy Veins, BL/Heroism) since it increases its effectiveness, and you want <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29529" target="_blank">[Drums of Battle]</a> stacked with your other trinket as well (be it +spell damage or +spell haste) since they have the same CD.<br>
<br>
Is there something I'm missing? (aside the actual math, but what I was getting at was that it doesn't desync CDs and it's not an mp5/dmg loss)</div>

</div>You're correct that you can coordinate your cooldowns properly in a 6 minute fight.<br>
If the fight gets shorter, or longer, it'll probably still work.<br>
<br>
My concerns that I wanted to hint at were two things really:<br>
<br>
1) Flame Caps have 3 minutes, Mana Gems have 2 minutes cooldown.<br>
That's not a problem per se, but it means that you have to align your cooldowns differently. It's more of an inconvenience than anything else really.<br>
Coordinating the Naaru Sliver with its 15s/90s timer on the other hand gives me creeps ...<br>
<br>
2) It is a synchronised mana and damage cooldown in one. That's my main concern really.<br>
In a fight like the given, you plan your damage/class cooldown pretty tight, and your mana cooldowns as a guideline.<br>
For example - mana pot when you're down 3k and around 2 and 4 minutes later, innervate or evocation whenever you run out of mana.<br>
<br>
Now, imagine you run low on mana and all your non-pot cooldowns come up in 20 seconds.<br>
Then you can evocate now, but risk having too much mana for the full effect of your mana gem.<br>
Or you can pot now, and hope that your mana lasts until and through your cooldowns.<br>
Or if you get an innervate from a feral that tanks half the time, then your timing is restricted as well.<br>
<br>
Now add that crits and JoW can be totally random, and your mana timing will become even less predictable.<br>
Or if you have clearcasing because you're arcane or the new talens came, and it gets even worse.<br>
<br>
<b>TL;DR</b><br>
Basically, you have a rather rigid DPS cooldown management with a rather volatile mana management.<br>
If you use SCB, you link both, which can lead to situations where you have to sacrifice either damage or mana from the trinket.<br>
<br>
With SCB, you also need to accomodate the +hit on it to use it fully.<br>
It also hasn't been great in Rawr when I checked it back then, so it didn't seem like a big deal.<br>
Even now it seems still only around the easy-to-acquire standard trinkets for non-arcane specs.<br>
<br>
That's basically the reason why I didn't expand on the trinket at lengths.<br>
More effort and less flexibility for the same or worse results. *cough* Daggers *cough*<br>

		<div id="post_message_761175"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Arcane-SCB and Fire-SCB is about as similar as chalk and cheese. Unlike Fire, arcane will quickly make mana threshold at any time within 5-10sec to cater for the 3k mana from the gem. Fire can't do this. The extra mana is also much inflated for arcane; not always so for fire. You maintain the flexibility, as arcane, to select "i'll do some AB spam now, drop 20-40% of my pool" or "I'll chill, stick at 80% or so for another 1m, then go all-out, then Evo instead of before CDs." Fire can't.<br>
<br>
And most fundamentally, SCB allows the arcane mage to combine everything at the same time. Skull-Head CD staggering works fine for Fire but Skull is a rather lame trinket for Arcane, giving only modest returns for its i-lvl. You're much better-off combining SCB-HEX-AP-IV-AB than subtracting SCB and adding in... Um... Icon? Quag's? Crusade? Sextant?... It's not so much that SCB is great, it's that (1) unless you're AM-Arcane-IV spec, TLC is shite (2) other trinkets are worse (3) the haste from Skull is counter-productive and gives bad damage-returns as arcane.<br>
<br>
As always with arcane, it's not that int is a good stat, it's that all the others are worse. It's not that SCB is great, just others are worse. It's not that T5 is great, no-T5 is worse... Anybody seeing a pattern here?<br>

</div>You quite possibly made more damage from subbing-in another trinket than you made from swapping gems to caps. Don't wear an SCB, untick "use flamecaps" see your DPS, re-tick it, check the analysis to make sure the sim didn't decide "use 1 stone and 2 caps" instead of "use 0 stones and all caps", and there's your DPS diff from flamecaps.<br>

The uniqueness of the Cap is it's extremely high up-time. 1/3 of the time uptime, even on "just" +80dmg is a god-damed LOT. Compare with +211 for 1/6 th of the time, which is Hex Head's use. That's half the time, 2.5* the power. The other coincidence with cap, is it's excellent combo-ability with CD-staggering.<br>

Typically, Cap-Hex-Combustion go first, then when the skull's out, IV-Skull-Destropot-(rest of cap) go next for the best possible scenario.

</div>Unless you can gain the benefit of the +hit from SCB it's an extremely underpowered trinket for fire, period. I am aware it stacks with Hex or Skull, I know it benefits CD stacking, this is all known and has been tested time and time again. The fact remains that SCB is a sub-standard trinket for fire purely because it has a fuck-all equip effect. 30crit is next to bullshit and the hit is almost always superfluous. I don't care if it's an extra 225 during CDs, and note that even if it is it's only 15sec and not 20. +225 for 1/4 of a minute every 3m is an average of +18.75. Every two minutes (in which case there goes your "stacking CDs" scenario) it's worth +28.15 average. That's great and all, and clearly more than Flamecap's piddly 1/3 of 80 (26.67), particularly when CDs inflate this average to just under twice  as much, but look at the side effect of wearing SCB:<br>
<br>
You're losing either a Hex Head: Passive +53, active +211 (averaged +35). Or a Skull: Passive +55, active 173haste (I won't average, because it's state makes it different in value to comparing +dmg partial uptime effects).<br>
<br>
Both a bloody country mile more than 30crit on SCB, which is practically worth +21dmg. And you fall into the pitfall of comparing either SCB to a Flamecap, or SCB to another trinket. When SCB should be compared to another trinket, AND a flamecap. Drop SCB: drop the +21dmg passive, drop the (let's go crazy and double the best-case of the use) +56dmg and gain a Hex for +53 , it's active for +35 (let's not multiply this, and assume the worse scenario of "it doesn't stack with anything") AND a flamecap for (again "no synergy" number) of 26.67. You lost +77. You gained +114. And that's Doubling the effect of SCB, and NOT GAINING ANY synergy from either cap or hex. QED.<br>
<br>
Rawr backs my claim: Take Manly, in Rawr, on Brutallus scenario, with optimal everything (as you put in your post "mana not a concern"), replace trinks with Hex/Skull, see DPS:2557. Then make any SCB combo: Skull? 2525. Hex? 2526. Shifting Naaru Sliver? 2543. there is not a single combo including SCB that makes it a good trinket. Dropping SCB for Hex in the best case pro-SCB scenario goes to 2577DPS. Unless you discover some reason I get a whole 30DPS less from SCB than anything else, the point is proven.<br>
<br>
You may think it is but sim/theorycraft prove that Hex/Skull staggering is superior to anything including an SCB. Period. Replace Hex with Shifting Naaru Sliver as apropriate, obviously.<br>
<br>
If you want to argue pro-SCB, you should turn up with numbers to back the claim rather than "but isn't it better?".<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Pardon me, in that case yes, if you are wearing SCB you're probably better off gemming, having checked your armory the reason you're seeing this is you're undercapped. If you remove SCB you drop hit. Gaining the SCB's 13hit gives a further 16damage worth to it's passive, making it a much better contender for the trinket slot than before. The DPS drop you're seeing is almost certainly from that. Once you get an offhand from Rage you'll reach the point where SCB needs replacing, however.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Even better would be using <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=31856" target="_blank">[Darkmoon Card: Crusade]</a>, but I'm not yet entirely sure rawr takes into account the fact that I might be OOM when calculating DPS, with all the "out of mana warnings" when reconstructing sequences, and having 50 seconds of 0 mana only means 10 lost dps? I guess I could use mana pots instead of destruction, but that would give me just a 4 DPS gain.<br>
<br>
Edit: I've never seen the Rage OH drop :-P. I can switch in <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30894" target="_blank">[Blue Suede Shoes]</a>, though...

		<div id="post_message_761594"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Since we got a second shifting naaru sliver, I ran the test to see if you could abuse it. Unfortunately, you can't. If you activate it, then someone else activate his on top of yours (or you run to his circle, whichever), then you do get a 'limitless power' 15s buff refresh, but after your power circle dies down your buff goes away. So the only real use to have more than 1 trinket is to be able to use it on the move by moving to someone else circle.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_761912"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->So essentially the use is as any other trinket with the catch that you can't move.  It's not like you plan to move when popping trinkets of course, but certain fights do call for it from time to time. Manly I think I recall you saying the minimum amount of time the buff stays on you upon leaving the circle is 2s, barring the circle disappearing of course.  Did you ever discover any sort of method to the randomness of how long you keep it?  More importantly what was your "average" buff timer?<br>
<br>
Basically I'm trying to find a non-ideal naaru trinket situation where HSH may out perform it.<br>
<br>
Something like a 4.5 min fight where you would only be able to pop either trinket 3 times, both having 2/3 line up with CD's and a good possibility of having to move out of your circle.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_761950"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Well, its kind of random. I have not seen any pattern for it. I thought it could be related with the regen tick check, but it doesnt seem to be the case. Most of the time that I run out of the power circle the buff stays 4-5s extra. Sometimes, very rarely, it will stay only 2s. Other times it will last almost full duration.<br>
<br>
So far it has rarely limited my options to be constrained within the circle. Sure, that one muru attempt when i mistakenly hit the trinket instead of drums on the way across the room (ffffff), that one sucked. The one place where it is more frustrating is on kil'jaeden, where you need to spread out if you have a debuff on you... having the circle can kind of screw you.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Last night i won Brutallus. By a lot, with 1 heroism, 33/28/0, and a moonkin/ele sham (rawr still says 2/48/11 outperforms even with that group, and still less than any of the other main classes).<br>

		<div id="post_message_762030"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I think the best class that can make use of the <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34429" target="_blank">[Shifting Naaru Sliver]</a> is shadow priest, because they can pack their dot cast at the tail end of its activation. I think destro locks cant make a particularly interesting use out of it (ie: how many spells can you cram in 15s of cast time). Affliction locks can't really use the haste efficiently, so that one is out too. That leaves arcane mages, which if I had to make an easy guess would be the #2 best user of the trinket. As number 3 I think it would be fire mages, but the damn bugger is a real mess to use well. Putting aside for now cooldown stacking, here is what I do with mine, and its quite a bit tricky.<br>

		<div id="post_message_764815"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->It seems the conventional wisdom is that rolling ignites happens when your casts are around 2.07 or so. But I had an interesting experience last night with what appears to be rolling ignites when my casts were not that fast.<br>
<br>
I have 111 haste rating, so with drums thats 191. 191/1570 is 12.1656% haste. So theoretically my fireballs with IV were at:<br>
3 seconds / (1 + 0.121656)(1.2) = about 2.23 seconds.<br>
<br>
In reality, however, the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080531033942/http://wowwebstats.com/zd4bytjatlf51" target="_blank">WWS</a> logs show the fireballs all over the map, from 2.638 to 2.17. <br>
<br>
Here's the interesting part:<br>
20:14'44.949 Tyfon's Fireball crits Anetheron for 6472 Fire damage <br>
<br>
20:14'47.388 Tyfon's Fireball crits Anetheron for 6431 Fire damage <br>
20:14'47.522 Tyfon's Ignite dots Anetheron for 1295 Fire damage <br>
<br>
20:14'49.558 Tyfon's Fireball crits Anetheron for 6451 Fire damage <br>
20:14'49.919 Tyfon's Ignite dots Anetheron for 2580 Fire damage <br>
<br>
20:14'52.196 Tyfon's Fireball crits Anetheron for 6212 Fire damage <br>
20:14'52.504 Tyfon's Ignite dots Anetheron for 3871 Fire damage <br>
<br>
20:14'54.554 Tyfon's Fireball crits Anetheron for 4869 Fire damage (815 resisted) <br>
20:14'54.691 Tyfon's Ignite dots Anetheron for 5113 Fire damage <br>
<br>
20:14'57.004 Tyfon's Fireball hits Anetheron for 3701 Fire damage <br>
20:14'57.143 Tyfon's Ignite dots Anetheron for 6087 Fire damage <br>
<br>
20:14'59.150 Tyfon's Ignite dots Anetheron for 6087 Fire damage <br>
<br>
total crit damage = 6472 + 6431 + 6451 + 6212 + 4869 = 30435 <br>
expect ignite ticks = 30435 * 0.4 = 12174 <br>
actual ignite ticks = 1295 + 2580 + 3871 + 5113 + 6087 + 6087 = 25033 <br>
<br>
thats a cool 12859 free damage. On the other hand this pulled aggro and killed me.<br>
<br>
So the question is, how could this have happened? My lag is pretty consistant (I think), and the fact that the Ignite ticks were just as all over the place as my fireballs, it certainly seems to be something server-side going on. Could this be something that changed in 2.4.2 or am I just (un)lucky?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>That was fixed in 2.0 with the whole ignite overhaul.<br>
<br>
Ignite cannot be resisted, does not have partial resists, and is not affected by additionial damage modifiers or vulnerabilities or reductions (like shield wall).<br>
No more Drakonids where your fireball hit for 3 times the damage and 9 times the ignite damage. Or 50k+ ticks on Thaddius.<br>
<br>
If it doesn't bug out, Ignite is exactly 40% of your crit damage. The differences come from bugged rolling/stuttering ignites.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Much worse than that. It means that engineering gear to produce Rolling may or may not work at all depending on random fluctuation. I suspect the best possible scenario depends on how much the fluctuation is in deviation, and ultimately will come down to two cases: Either your latency is very stable, or at least stable enough to be able to offer Rolling with certain CDs going quite consistently. Or, your latency is all over the place, meaning you're better-off tuning as much haste as needed to provide that during the majority of your time (no CDs at all) you'll possibly roll or possibly not, depending on latency.<br>
<br>
Inconsistent, cryptical, odd and problematic. And the poster above got killed for it. Could Rolling be any more the red-headed bastard child of buggy mechanics? Thank God it's brother, Disappearing Ignites is even rarer. Except for those happy to Fireblast amongst us, that is.</div>

</div>Hmm, I probably should have read and commented on this post last night.<br>
<br>
Basically all the inconsistencies boil down to this: The delay from your initial crit to when the ignite debuff is placed.<br>
<br>
This delay can be anywhere from .2s all the way to 1s. This is why a 2.3s cast can get a rolling ignite to happen, although it only will happen on the 2nd crit and never after. While a cast &lt; 2.1s will cause rolling ignites, it will also pushback the original ignite tick to coincide with the rest of your casts to further "force" rolling ignites to happen.<br>
<br>
I'm just waiting for someone to obtain the gear level needed to chain cast a 2.09s (what Manly says is needed) Fireball and really get a rolling ignite going, and see what kind of possible gains we get.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_767674"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->This goes right back to what I proposed a few months ago. We need a mod that tracks ignites. Not necessarily for TC purpose, but also for optimal play purpose. If we could single-out variables by having an aced ignite-tracking-mod and test across multiple mages, we could know for sure what tends to work best. Like, imagine a case where the mod would show you a bar for the next ignite tick is due, and what should be your casting adjustment to perform a rolling ignite.<br>
<br>
Then that mod should integrate into quartz, and extract latency data from it, even possibly showing the ignite ticks directly on quartz casting bar.<br>
<br>
Imagine something roughly<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:0px"><img src="assets/code_html.gif" border="0"></div>
	<pre class="alt2" dir="ltr" style="

		padding: 3px;
		border: 1px inset;
		width: 694px;
		height: 162px;
		text-align: left;
		overflow: auto"><b>[****           ]</b>  (bar displays 2s)

----
current ignite: 1000 / 2
----
total ignite dmg: 200 000
expected: 180 000
gain: + x %</pre>
</div>* 100ms would be determined by comparing the cast time left on current spell vs time to next ignite tick. The closer you get to 0 ms, the more you're in the optimal rolling ignite case.<br>
<br>
Then from that mod we could work out and analyse/track if scorch/fireblast is worth doing. Or fireball/fireblast.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Unfortunately it seems this kill the aforementioned tactic of s4 dagger of alacrity + evocation (227 haste). It will reduce the channeling time of a 9.5 Evocation by 1.2. That's around the gcd. So pretty much there's zero gain. Shame really, I was too eager to try that. <br>
<br>
(For Arcane users who use an int weapon while Evocating it's of course a nerf as well.)<br>
<br>
Edit- An unconstructive QQ, but while merging sounded nice for the Xpack, but currently it just adds another CoDing lock I ll never beat. It's still a very welcomed buff though, Malediction giving 3% to mages might make Affliction viable in Sunwell.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Even discounting T6 bonus I found Evo would overflow my mana given SP wouldn't stop while I was channeling. Not to mention it wasn't always "safe" to Evo exactly when I wanted, which was mana=0%. More often than not I found it impossible to have less than 10% mana and get Evo timed as I felt more comfortable (ie. no aoe/silence/motion inc). Having huge regen probably made this particular point extra hard. I can see there's perhaps some marginal return in doing a partial Evo with int-gear, but then again it's not an exact science on anything except Brut or possibly terron.<br>
<br>
I suspect it'll be more valuable to fire, though again most likely in the "skimming evo for min time-wasted" context rather than "need more absolute mana". This should be particularly so given we're not supposed to swap in Evo until a number of other mana-sources have been substituted.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_799447"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Here is an idea I had for a favorable mana/dps tradeoff.  I have read these boards for a few months and have not seen it mentioned before.<br>
<br>
Start the fight with a high INT weapon and/or wand equiped.  Start your usual Scorching.  When you have used most of the extra mana from the INT weapon, do a Fire Blast and switch back to your usual weapon during Fire Blast GCD (pre-2.4.3 you can skip the Fire Blast).  In effect you get your scorching and a Fire Blast mostly supported by "free" mana.  The downside is that you cast these with lower damage, and that you need to mix in a relatively unfavorable Fire Blast.  You really need a simulation to handle this correctly, but some quick approximation suggests that the mana gained is very good for the DPS lost.<br>
<br>
For an example, let me take the ZA Staff, with 30 int from gems and 30 int from enchants, vs <a class="itemlink q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30910" target="_blank">[Tempest of Chaos]</a> and <a class="itemlink q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30872" target="_blank">[Chronicle of Dark Secrets]</a> with Sunfire.  The Staff gives you an extra 68 INT or 1020 Mana.  The Tempest/Chronicle gives the equivalent of about +160 spelldamage over the staff.<br>
<br>
In this example, you get your first 4 scorches and a Fire Blast using mostly the extra mana - when you switch weapons you will be only 165 mana down (or slightly less with some in combat mana regen).  These five casts take 7.5 sec base.  With 20% haste is is 6.25 sec.<br>
<br>
Roughly speaking (ignoring the impact mixing a Fire Blast in your rotation and the fact that spell damage is less valuable on Scorch/FB than it is on your later Fireball spam) you give up 160 spell damage for 6.25 sec, to get 1020 extra Mana.  In a 6 minute fight that like giving up 2.8 spell damage for 14.2 in combat MP5 or a ratio of 5.1.  This is roughly the same ratio you get from using Mana Pots vs Destruction Pots.  The INT weapon is already useful to carry in case of Evocation.<br>
<br>
I would be interested in seeing the results if a simulation developer wants to do this correctly.<br>

For Example: You equip a staff with 100 more int than your normal one and gain 1500 mana for a total of 11500. You then spend the 1500 gained from the staff for a new total of 10000/11500, or ~87% of your total. If you re-equip your normal staff you retain 87% of your total mana for a new total of ~8700/10000. When you gain int, you keep the same amount of mana as you had previously, when you lose int (as you describe) you retain the same % of mana, IIRC.</div>

</div>That's wrong in fact. Your current mana level does not change in any way be equiping or unequiping gear, you can actually try this out extremely easily too. Have your character get naked and then swap back in all his gear, your mana will <b>not</b> stay at 100%, it'll remain at whatever absolute value it was at.<br>
<br>
There's only a single case in which the percentage is kept when a maximum amount of either health or mana is changed, and that's when a Druid swaps to or from Bear form.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Back when we played Diablo 2 LOD and a Barbarian would give Battle Orders, which was the equivalent of Commanding Shout, it'd more than double your HP pool so it suddenly looked like you were perilously close to death. Now, if you had the insanity to play on a Hardcore server, "death" meant "never play that character again. Ever." including "lose all your gear. All that gear you farmed with three other characters, which you levelled so you could farm gear for this one."<br>
<br>
Good ol' BO scare. The cause for many soiled pants, and many cigarette sales.<br>
<br>
With hind-sight, however, it's a shame Evo didn't stay as it was for PvE terms. Because nowadays, swapping Spirit Weapons would give much more benefit than swapping int weapons.<br>
<br>
Having said as much, I still maintain it's pointless for any spec which is very mana-dependent, ie. Arcane, as it overflows without swapping quite easily. Not to mention the whole weapon-swap mechanic is retarded. Weapon swapping should not only incur a GCD in my oppinion, but 1.5sec CD during which you're treated as "not wearing" either of the two weapons you swap.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yes, your sample size is way too low to distinguish 2.1% vs 1.2%.  This is especially<br>
true as this is a sample size over different bosses that may or may not have frost<br>
resistance mucking things up.<br>
<br>
There are statistical techniques that will tell you how big a sample you need to<br>
have a 99% confidence rating in the result and the deviation you can expect for<br>
a given sample size.  I was going to get all geeky and work it out but I'm rusty<br>
by about 2 years on it and my license for my fancy statistics tool expired so I'm<br>
afraid of giving out misinformation.<br>
<br>
So the following is conservative, based on hazy memories of trying to distinguish<br>
similar variances in quality projects:<br>
<br>
For a good test, get a tank and healer, find a L70 raid boss they can tank pretty<br>
much forever and spam frost bolt 1s.  Get a sample size of at least 500 and<br>
that's probably good enough to distinguish a 1% shift with reasonable confidence.<br>
<br>
If you're trying to distinguish tenths of percents, you'll need more like 10k.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I can only assume that my insanely lucky crit %age of 38% on frostbolts ; with 0 misses (how i'll never know... I usually run at around 3-7% real world miss rate with the short fights in BT/MH) meant that I had a "lucky day at the office".<br>
<br>
But this is just me hoping for a cookie. <br>
<br>
------------------------<br>
Imo frostbolt crits in PvE are slightly overpowered; but much like a pom-pyro back in the day, or a double proc of MSD hasted AMs with arcane power the day after that day... The day will come when its served it usefulness and is again redundant. It is balanced by slightly low hit, and a non talented crit %age.<br>
<br>
<br>
Aside #2 :<br>
Also ; does anyone have any screenshots of fire specs doing over 5k average dps (even for a short period of time ; maybe averaged of 100-200k total damage early into a fight on trash or something?) ... I've got some 5777 average dps ones as arcane and I wondered if you fire girlies could compare with all yer Sunwell loots. Oh what's that? You can't because of threat... ohhh right ok. So you use non-talented AE and hope? Ohh right.... /endtaunt <br>

Trash DPS doesn't matter. Fire specs might surpass 5k DPS with cooldown stacking in molten fury range, but this also doesn't matter - it's just a pretty number. The important number is the total damage done over the boss encounter, and in this aspect both deep fire and arc/frost have been shown to be viable. Archimonde DPS doesn't matter - a mage's job in that encounter is to decurse and not die; DPS is what you do with your spare time once you've covered those first two tasks.</div>

</div>I wouldn't even give you a cracker for that comparison.<br>
<br>
Of all the bosses to choose you choose ARCHIMONDE???  are you trying to be retarded or is it a natural state?<br>
<br>
Archimonde is a DECURSING fight, which means your dps is redundant and your primary job is to decurse, something that fire mage did 200% better then you did.<br>
<br>
Our first Archi kill back in September mages were told to do no damage at all and he died very cleanly so its definitely not a dps race.  <br>
<br>
If you want to draw comparisons to other mages then use fights where the comparison at least actually has some merit.<br>
<br>
<br>
Edited to Add:  Beaten....that's what I get for actually looking up how long ago it was that we had our first Archi kill.</div>

		<div id="post_message_744808" class="post_message_underline">Have to agree with the rest on Jammi,<br>
<br>
Mage's primary job on Archimonde is to decurse and not die.  You could have done 400k damage on him, or got second on DPS. But if you did that by dpsing so much, such that when that one fellow in grips near you needed decursing and you didn't do it. And he died, and the soulcharge wiped the raid with archimonde at 12%.  Then, for all that fancy damage you did, you failed in your true duty on that fight. <br>
<br>
I am sure there will be kills when you are lucky enough that you could DPS the whole fight without having to decurse at all. Its probably cos there was another decurser (whether mage or druid) near you who picked up the ball and did your job for you. <br>
<br>
Archimonde is not a good measure of mage DPS at all. Actually, for spec comparisions, even Teron isn't a very good measure either. Though people love to refer to it. He has so much pushback that arcane suffers an inherent disadvantage compared to fire for that fight. (Fire has 70% pushback immunity). And people die and become ghosts in the fight. So it is hardly a case of all DPSers going full out the whole fight. <br>
<br>
Teron seems to me more about handling ghosts well than about pushing DPS. We die cos ghosts got into the raid, not because DPS was lacking.<br>
<br>
The only few parts in MH and BT where DPS truely matters is Akama stage two, and ROS stage 3. We have had the raid wipe in stage 3 because of insufficient DPS. And we have ever failed to kill Akama's shade in stage two and have to repeat the encounter (though that rarely happens nowadays).<br>
<br>
Nowhere else in any fight in MH and BT is there a big requirement of "do x amount of raid damage within y amount of time or the raid dies". The enrage timer for most BT and MH bosses are just not short enough to have to push DPS to that extent. And most of the fights are more based on getting execution down, moving at the right times, etc, than about DPS. <br>
<br>
If you really want to measure it where it matters, try measuring your DPS during ROS stage 3 or specifically Akama stage 2 and see where you stand. At least I would agree that DPS matters during those two stages. But not for Archimonde.</div>

Akama stage 2 is too short, it takes my guild ~30s to burn him down. Arcane would again have somewhat of an advantage over fire, since you can just go all out and not care about mana.<br>

</div>     I think you're assertion that arcane is a tad easier in MH/BT is pretty much right on.<br>
<br>
     Rage Winterchill might be a good boss fight for fire but it's better as arcane.  When I did this as arcane after patch 2.4 I had like 705 mp5 while casting.  That's what showed <b>in my character screen</b>.  In other words I've got a few hundred more than that cycling in from spriests, a shaman, potions, gems etc.  You can spam fully ramped AB the whole 2 minute fight guaranteed.<br>
<br>
     A great fire fight (depending on your guild's strat) would probably be az'galor.  The strat my guild used meant that if you were fire on this fight, you stood in one spot at 41 yards and happily blew the shit out of him without a care in the world while all the arcane mages, shadow priests, and hunters' pets soaked the RoFs.<br>
<br>
     You might also think of Teron Gorefiend due to the pushback avoidance but 2x IV takes the sting off for 40 seconds.<br>
<br>
     Either way, this thread is directed more towards SWP mage play rather than MH/BT.  We're supposed to have been farming that old content for a long time now =).</div>

		<div id="post_message_744888" class="post_message_underline">Hehe well I'm glad no-one over-reacted ; I was just trying to bring some friendly rivalry into the debate. Which I think I did, but it also raised a few eyebrows having read your reactions....<br>
<br>
1 )  Fire mages live in a world of a 3 second base cast time. Any fight that involves ; decursing, moving  or blinking means that the fire mage has a decision as to whether its worth his while finishing his cast or doing something different. An arcane mage does not have this problem. Please believe when I say that having decursive sat over Archimonde's knees and my mouse hovering waiting to decurse [which I spam when someone gets grip meaning my current cast finishes and immediately de-curse) it is MUCH easier, and better in terms of impact to damage, to be arcane. I did the second most decursing on the actual kill, for example, and I bet you I beat the fire mages to the decurse action 10x more than they did to me. So please don't say "Oh thats a fight where its more important to decurse than dps" because you a) assume I prioritised dps over decursing [which is simply not the case] and b) That decursing causes your dps to falter. Decursing isn't really a problem to an arcane mage. We live on the GCD so losing one to a spell with a much reduced mana cost as opposed to our AB is neither here nor there. <br>
<br>
On many fights these days (PRE-SUNWELL ; I have not stepped foot near that place and have only read from these amazing forums about those encounters, so thats a small proviso but I'm sure they must be similar ; Blizzard has never I believe wanted casters or ranged to be stood still for very long in any encounter since Gruul's one eyed head came into the world) we have to move. Movement gimps a fire mage; gimps his damage, gives him more mana than he can spend, and offers the potential for scorch debuffs to fall off if followed by a silence or someone dying or needing decursing or something that interrupts the casting flow. Arcane's only similar issue would be losing the AB debuff [which happens every ice-block... by the way.. and is REALLY annoying!!] and having to restack it with AB&gt;FrB&gt;AB&gt;FrB etc  due to the AB casting bug which is a real pain in the bum.<br>
<br>
<br>
2) Rage winterchill has frost resistance so if an arcane mage (arc/frost) beats you on that fight, he got very lucky with resists, or had a very good SP (or lots of movement = regen time "I had to move for 23 seconds, ooh goodie I've now got LOADS of mana to spunk on AB spam!") or the movement screwed you over and actually helped him...<br>
<br>
3 ) I'm slightly disconcerted by all the people saying "This fight isn;t fair to compare you have to x, y or z" or "Teron is an unfair comparison due to pushbacks which fire gets 70% chance to avoid"...<br>
<br>
Guys (and girls) ; reality check please ; If your spec causes you to not be able to do as much damage as someone else - Change it. Do not whine and say "Aww mommy it wasn't fair."...  That is <i> totally </i> against I believe as a raider. Any mage that I heard excusing low dps with saying "I did more decursing than you" or "oh but but Supremus has fire resistance" needs to learn that every fight (from Morogrim AoE causing serious mana issues back in the day to necessitate mana oil and/or mage armor to survive, to any fight involving movement) has its ups and downs and if your spec allows you to beat most of them ; it is a better than spec than one that doesn't. Mages who expect to be able to stand still and nuke without any concerns in order to do their optimum dps, frankly, are not maximising their opportunity to eek the benefit from the options available to them.<br>
<br>
4) Cooldowns. On almost all fights that matter (and most that don't) ; as someone else said "The difference between an excellent mage and a mediocre one is only in CD control &amp; management." – Pintofbrew, Kilrogg EU.<br>
<br>
I have ; two icy veins, one cold snap, two iceblocks, one arcane power, and a POM ; every 5 minutes. You have combustion and icy veins. That's your only CDs to manage. (BTW this "you" fire mage and me "arcane mage" is again just banter )<br>
If I get ghosted on Teron : In the 20 seconds I have before I leave ; I can dump an entire mana bar into him with AB spam with Arcane Power up, POM as I run to the corner, with a 40% threat reduction... That is a HUGE dps boost that isn't achievable with fire. This is one example where arcane vs fire has a clear difference. IF you exclude the ability to do this from your comments on Teron.. then I think you're not seeing the whole picture. You say "70% pushback resistance is a plus - I say, having two icy veins (to guarantee a safe evocate), 40% threat reduction, and more cooldowns, more often - gives me flexibility to adapt to a boss encounter you can only dream of!!<br>

</div>Yeah no its natural  I was dropped on my face as a child  I'm sorry to have wound you up amigo.<br>
<br>
I like how you shouted that the other mage did 200% more decursing than me in his kill.<br>
If you notice ; he was one of two mages on his kill. He did 23 and the other mage did 9.<br>
I did 12 ; the other FOUR mages in raid with me did (on that kill) 11, 1, 4 and 6 respectively.<br>
<br>
So your argument that I'm not doing my job (when I, in fact, did more decursing than any other mage in the raid with me) doesn't hold any water now does it?<br>
Also don't presume to dare tell me I'm not doing my job unless your argument is sound. Which it isn't. As 1/5th of the mages present on my kill - and with him being 1/2 of the mages present on HIS kill - I did proportionaly more decursing than him. <br>
<br>
What you could mention ; would be the fact that he was very unlucky and had to decurse a hell of a lot and that the mage he was fighting with did APPALLINGly badly to have done when he had only 9 decurses to do. Either that or the second mage needs to get decursive installed and put somewhere convenient on his screen (and bind all abilities to buttons so he can dps and watch decursive 99% of the time) so that he doesn't get beaten to the punch on decursing. However, for all we know - the mage that came second could have been leading the raid and had other priorities. You can't ever know.<br>
<br>
I stated when I made it I said, "comparison hardly supporting my comical aside"... so, I hope you can see now, was mostly joking, partly baiting, and partially trying to make a point about arcane's superiority in many many TBC situations as described above.<br>
<br>
I would urge anyone thinking "Arcane is great when you get an SP and CoS and mana-tide but I'd &lt;insert defamory action here&gt; when you don't" to try the spec out. Its makes movement a thing to rejoice, and allows you to go nuts and have more fun DPSing throughout the fight, not just on 20% onwards.</div>

</div>Hardly ; on Kazrogal- frostbolt spamming the other day my mana bar didn't even drop as I was casting. My regen equalled the cost of the frostbolts for a short period of time. Thats not possible with fire. <br>
<br>
As arcane you gear for huge intellect, huge regen, and you use mage armor to increase / sustain your dps - and only use molten on fights such as Supremus or Archie when the dps time is similar to movement times overall. Mage armor being your best armor comes in VERY handy in TBC encounters ; as many involve resistance gear. We also benefit from Mag absorption which not only increases our resistance - but returns mana to us on a full resist (Which, considering I only took two marks last time is ALOT of mana!!) . On Kazrogal arcane is neither superior or inferior ; IF you consider the whole picture.<br>
<br>
People open your eyes to the hidden facets to each spec.</div>

Please don't make it Sunwell only ; 2.4 might be only the most recent but the 2.3 thread has descended into "If I use this gem will it...." which isn't to me... really relevant to a theorycrafting debate ; thats what Rawr is for - your own gear related to what you have available.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Forgive my ignorance, but...<br>
<br>
Anetheron- If you DPS the boss, fire's fine.  If you DPS the infernals, fire is behind.<br>
Kaz'rogal- Surely the hit to your mana pool makes this a far better fight for fire?<br>
Az'Galor-Fire outranges the ROF, arcane doesn't (unless it spams frostbolt?).  I think fire wins this one.<br>
Archimonde- Arcane has the advantage here as it can take advantage of the burn windows.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Rage Winterchill - Arcane wins hands down due to Brilliance Aura.  If you throw a frostbolt as arcane in this fight something is wrong.<br>
<br>
Anetheron - Your likely to spend half your time dpsing the infernals, but they don't really pose that big of a problem if you have 2 locks, and they throw up CoE/CoS.  Though if you a wear a bit of shadow resist, arcane likely pulls ahead.<br>
<br>
Kaz'rogal - Shadow resist set + magic absorption = mana gained, not lost, from Mark.  Also arcane mages can ice block twice out of the debuff.  Though you have to restack your debuff.  Maybe I'll submit a bug report, and see if I can get this fixed.<br>
<br>
Azgalor - RoF is a joke, arcane is great if you wear some SR, low threat + silence resist = win.<br>
<br>
Archimonde - Sucks for fire, great for arcane.<br>
<br>
Trash - Arcane is the clear winner here as well. PoM + polymorph on 6 necro waves = win.  The sheer dps output of AE spam is crazy, too.<br>
<br>
If you want to double your mp5 while casting on Rage Winterchill/Anetheron make your group stand near Jaina.  Also an innervate will take you from 0 mana to full while chaining 1s arcane blasts (IV/AP/Heroism) while standing near Jaina.  So burn hard, and ask for an innervate when you hit 5-10% mana.<br>
<br>

</div>It's called Brilliance Aura from being in proximity of Lady Jaina Proudmoore (this depends on your tanking positioning) If you stay in range of it, it increases your spirit by 100%.  This allowed me to achieve about 700 mp5 while casting where I normally have just under 400 or so.<br>
<br>
Edit:<br>
Pintofbrew beat me to the punch on that one, Grayrest.  But yes, my point was Brilliance Aura <i>could</i> make it more favorable for an arcane mage vs a fire mage that's all.  I should go ahead and point out that when I was speaking of that specific fight I was referring to Brilliance Aura, which is a mechanic of this specific fight.  I was taking that as a given, assuming everyone would know what I was referring to when I posted that.  <br>
<br>
Yes Pint, I know why my mp5 was high, I wasn't wondering "how the hell did I pull that off?" the statement was nitpicking fight mechanics since that's what the discussion has petered into. <br>
<br>
I apologize for engaging in pointless banter over the topic.  I will restrain from chiming in and playing devil's advocate (sorry).<br>
<br>
If someone were a new mage asking me what to spec for MH/BT, I would definitely respond, smilingly, with something like, "What color is better, Red or Blue?"  This would be to give them an idea of how opinionated the discussion is.  At this point, it is proven that both are viable and competitive for the content.  The only way one could give any advice regarding the issue is if your intrepid inquirer simply wanted to mindlessly copy your exact moves and that is <i>not</i> what is to be promoted in these forums.</div>

		<div id="post_message_745162" class="post_message_underline" style="min-height: 183px;">Both specs are fun and both are viable throughout current raiding.  They both have the potential to do equivalent levels of dps.  Arc/Frost requires more raid support but is compensated through faster ramp-up and more frequent bursts of damage on a long encounter.  Fire is more constant dps but is affected a bit more by RNG determining its actual individual performance, it also isn't anywhere near as reliant on being grouped with a Shadowpriest which can be an issue on the Twins where healing is the priority.<br>
<br>
I was specced Arc/Frost for all of SWP so far and just yesterday specced back to Fire but I may spec back to Arc/Frost at some point just because I prefer not to get bored being stuck as one spec.  Both have their good points and their bad points and it's really nice to be able to raid as either and still be just as viable.  Good thing that it is relatively simple and cheap to respec, change out a few pieces of gear and move a few macros and be all set to go as an other spec.<br>
<br>
<br>
My issue with Jammi and it still remains is that he picked an encounter that is completely retarded to attempt to demonstrate any abject superiority for either of the 2 specs.  Show me Brutallus where both mages are in the same raid group, show me Teron.  Just about any other encounter, even Dr Boom, would have more relevance to the discussion then Archimonde.<br>
<br>
Your job on Archi (like everyone else who has posted has said) is not to die and to decurse.  Your dps is completely irrelevant to the encounter.  Did the other mage put on some PvP gear to ease the load on the healers?  Did he run a doomfire away from the raid the way he is supposed to to ensure that it doesn't curve around and head back into the melee.  Was he stuck spending so much of his time decursing that scorch fell off the target?  These are all things that can and will happen during that encounter and none of it matters since his only jobs there are to decurse and not to die.<br>
<br>
Lets look a little closer at those WWSs shall we, since you seem content that they demonstrate your point.<br>
<br>
First off your kill took 8 minutes and 14seconds and theirs took 3 minutes and 52seconds.  Your kill had 5 mages decursing along with 2 out of 4 of the druids present.  Their kill had 2 mages present and of the 3 druids present only 1 decursed anything.  You had 44 total decurses and they had 39.  <br>
<br>
So that means you decursed 27% of the total curses present and he decursed 59%.  So I guess I really was wrong on that point.  He did quite a bit more then 200% of your decursing. <br>
<br>
So what about that difference in overall fight length?  You used 12 GCDs for decursing which is 3.6% of the total time available in the encounter.  He decursed 23 times which is 14.9% of the total time available for the encounter.<br>
<br>
Finally we all know that WWS's dps is skewed in favor of Arcane due to the DoT on Fireball.  Good thing you can open another column and see the average dps done over the whole encounter (which as Manly has pointed out numerous times is the real number to look at when comparing dps between specs).<br>
<br>
Your 1217dps was in actuality 892dps.  His 1209dps was actually 1188dps.  <br>
<br>
So I guess what the WWS reports really show is that even in a raid group that minimized your own personal level of responsibility to the point where you were actually able to spend the majority of your time dpsing you still failed by comparison to a mage who not only shouldered the majority of the decursing but who also outdpsed the crap outta you.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">1 )  Fire mages live in a world of a 3 second base cast time. Any fight that involves ; decursing, moving  or blinking means that the fire mage has a decision as to whether its worth his while finishing his cast or doing something different. An arcane mage does not have this problem. Please believe when I say that having decursive sat over Archimonde's knees and my mouse hovering waiting to decurse [which I spam when someone gets grip meaning my current cast finishes and immediately de-curse) it is MUCH easier, and better in terms of impact to damage, to be arcane.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>You may not realise, but you know ahead of time when the curse is due to be cast, which allows you to adapt your casts for when decurses are going to be due, and switch to scorch/fireblast. But regardless, you have yet to prove me that more decursing = better job. All that matters is people not dying. Not the amount of decursing. The difference is quite stark since it means your real goal is to decurse ideally somewhere before the first tick of the curse - not when it is just put up. <br>
<br>
And FWIW, you contradict yourself. <i>"decision as to whether its worth his while finishing his cast or doing something different. An arcane mage does not have this problem."</i> You clearly indicate that you spam decurse so that it is cast after you finish casting your current spell, which means you wait to finish your cast just as well as the fire mage. You would have that problem if the fight required twitch reflexes. Unfortunately, no fight in the game save Noth and Sapphiron fits into that category.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Movement gimps a fire mage; gimps his damage, gives him more mana than he can spend, and offers the potential for scorch debuffs to fall off if followed by a silence or someone dying or needing decursing or something that interrupts the casting flow. Arcane's only similar issue would be losing the AB debuff [which happens every ice-block... by the way.. and is REALLY annoying!!] and having to restack it with AB&gt;FrB&gt;AB&gt;FrB etc  due to the AB casting bug which is a real pain in the bum.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Movement also gimps arcanes damage. And I'm sorry to say but I can't seem to recall a fight where scorch specifically falls off. Maybe if you have bad mages. A good example would be a fight where the boss clears all debuffs, but again, thats unrelated with movement. The closest I can imagine is archimonde, but if Archimonde is the one example you're basing yourself on, then your argument holds no weight. If a fire mage loses a scorch stack (on archimonde), it means arcane is far more likely to lose AB stacks.<br>
<br>
Also, you seriously need to understand that <i>"gives him more mana than he can spend"</i> does not apply to fire. Fire does not like remotely have mana issues. The only time I use evocation is after phase 2 on Illidan and maybe* kaz'rogal if I don't get any resist. Fire does not have mana issues, and <i>always</i> has more mana than it can spend. Movement does not affects that.<br>

</div>WTF? Arcane casts only arcane blast on rage winterchill. Also, 23 seconds of movement ? The most I ever move on archimonde is either fireblast/move for 1.5s or blink. If my movement lasts more than 1.5s total, it means blink failed.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">4) Cooldowns. On almost all fights that matter (and most that don't) ; as someone else said "The difference between an excellent mage and a mediocre one is only in CD control &amp; management." – Pintofbrew, Kilrogg EU.<br>
<br>
I have ; two icy veins, one cold snap, two iceblocks, one arcane power, and a POM ; every 5 minutes. You have combustion and icy veins. That's your only CDs to manage. [...]40% threat reduction, and more cooldowns, more often - gives me flexibility to adapt to a boss encounter you can only dream of!</div>

	</tbody></table>
</div>Fire mages have trinkets, drums, molten fury (yes, this is a cooldown for all means and purposes), combustion, icy veins, bloodlust, flame cap and destruction potion. Thats a lot more than just combustion and icy veins. And on the contrary to your claim, I believe that fire mages are better suited to fit any situation than an arcane mage for the simple reason that we have a stronger and more flexible arsenal of spells. I'm talking {arcane blast, frostbolt and arcane explosion} vs {scorch, fireball, fireblast, dragon's breath, blastwave, arcane explosion}. This is a bit the reason that warlocks don't fare all too well on trash - they are fairly limited to {shadowbolt, seed of corruption}, which offers very low flexibility. I know many guilds have warlocks topping meters on trash (I'm talking non-aoe trash), but if you play against a good fire mage they'll fall significantly behind simply because of that flexibility.<br>
<br>
I am not denying that having a 1.5s cast time main spell has its advantages, but it won't magically make you the most flexible by virtue of having a short cast time. I am not arguing about threat - in my experience it has rarely been an issue save on eredar twins reverse order.<br>

</div>What does it matter whether you can go 'nuts' only at the final 20% or on the entirety of the fight ? All that matters is final damage. And for what its worth, arcane is restrained to pop its cooldown during bloodlust, not exactly 'at any given time'. Which kinds of goes back to what I was saying: "what does it matter <i>when</i> you can go nuts?". Both fire and arcane depends on when bloodlust is activated.<br>
<br>
-------------- edit<br>
The problem isn't whether or not arcane/frost can compete. The problem is that you're using the <i>wrong arguments</i> to show it.</div>

</div>Why not?<br>
<br>
I submit that you do more dps on Kaz/Azgalor/Anetheron with the resist gear, than you would without.  I'm not saying go full SR, but <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32649" target="_blank">[Medallion of Karabor]</a>+<a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32420" target="_blank">[Night's End]</a> w/<a id="itemlink" class="q3" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28277" target="_blank">[Formula: Enchant Cloak - Greater Shadow Resistance]</a> works great.  This puts you at 183SR with 0/5MA, which is high enough to partially resist ~40% of the time.  Since the silences/mark/carrion swarm are binary spells you can fully resist almost half of them!<br>
<br>
So I submit that with the 2 pieces of SR gear above, you'll have more mana on Kaz'rogal, less silences on Azgalor, and be a relatively tough target on Anetheron (damn if my healer always gets swarmed).</div>

		<div id="post_message_745258" class="post_message_underline">There is one other disadvantage to Arc/Frost that no one has mentioned.  That 1.5s cast time means you are just about always inside the GCD which means that Ice Block is no longer an instant thing since it no longer activates during the GCD even with a /stopcasting macro in place.<br>
<br>
There have been a few occassions in SWP where I went for Ice Block to avoid dying and got the spell not ready message and died.  Sure you could argue that it is the healers responsibility to prevent that situation from occurring but with our limited health pools and the amount of damage thrown around being practically insta-gibbed is not completely uncommon and being perpetually inside the GCD does make that an issue that Fire doesn't have to deal with quite as badly since Fire's spells take longer to cast so they spend less total time inside the GCD. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
On another note, has anyone retested Arcane Blast in 2.4.2 to see if the whole 2.5-2.5 thing is still in place.  I tried stacking the debuff with straight Arcane Blast spam last night and even though the cast bar was showing the bug my latency meter on Quartz was significantly larger then normal (during the stacking) and then returned to normal once AB was full stacked) and it seemed like the spells were casting much faster then the bugged casting bar would lead one to believe.<br>
<br>
Maybe someone with a G15, a spam macro and a stopwatch could go a few rounds with Dr. Boom and see if that bug is still actually active or merely a client-side UI discrepancy.</div>

This wasn't a little, this was like half the bar being Red.  I also for the life of me can't figure out if that proves the point that the AB stacking is bugged or if it shows that the cast times may be stacking correctly server side but showing incorrectly on the client side.  Hurts my head to think about it which was why I was suggesting the stopwatch approach.  I would do it myself but I am lazy and have never figured out how to spam keys besides manually which is not exactly the most accurate of methods.</div>

</div>I wonder if it's supposed to be a tradeoff between mobility and spell damage.  Obviously, with most on-use trinkets, you can pop it and keep blasting, and if a deadly boss ability heads your way, you can move and still keep the benefit, provided you have time to fire another cast after the movement.  With this Power Circle implementation, they could make it so that you'd have to risk getting gibbed by &lt;random boss ability&gt; to gain the full effect of the trinket. *shrugs*</div>

Also, apparently since 2.4.2 the trinket cooldown is 90s instead of 2min, finally matching better the 15s duration (I mean, makes more sense). And yes, before someone mentions it, I am well aware that thottbot/wowhead does not confirms my claims.<br>

Before people ask, its single player. And it has always been. Pre-2.4.2 it was giving a buff to everyone, but the buff was inactive except to the trinket holder. They changed the name of the buff in 2.4.2 and now it only applies to the caster.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Awesome you just proved to us how much of an idiot you really are thank you! Frostbolt is a binary spell it can only hit or not hit and it can not be partially resisted. On Rage as well you would as Manly pointed out Arcane Blast him. WTF are you talking about with movement.. it should not take you 23 seconds to move out of Death and Decay even like a chicken with your head cut off. Also, with frostbolt, assuming that you put 3 points into elemental precision and you are hit capped the number that you do miss with your frostbolts should be around 1% anyways as it is a hit or miss binary spell.</div>

</div><br>
This is actually incorrect.<br>
<br>
A binary spell can only hit or miss but when casting on something with a significant amount of resistance it will miss a lot more then 1% of the time.<br>
<br>
How a binary spell works is that first the level based resistances are checked and then the resistances are checked.  Any additional +hit that you have will actually be applied against the target's resistances and will actually act like spell penetration (whereas for any spell that can be partially resisted the additional hit is simply wasted).<br>
<br>
The classic example:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px; ">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:0px"><img src="assets/citation.gif" border="0"></div>
	<table cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" border="0" width="100%">
	<tbody><tr>
		<td class="alt2" style="border:1px inset">
			
				    For binary spells only, there is an additional modifier for the resistance of the victim to your particular spell school: fire, frost, shadow, nature, arcane. That modifier is multiplied by your hit chance to get your actual chance to land. This is done with binary spells only, because they never do partial damage.<br>
<br>
    Example:<br>
<br>
    Eyonix the Mage (level 60) fires a frost bolt at Yeti of Doom (level 63). Eyonix is also wearing a total of +6% spell hit gear. Yeti of Doom has frost resistance such that he takes 50% from level 60 frost attacks. So, here‘s the hit calculation:<br>
<br>
    0.83 (83% for +3 levels mob) + 0.06 (+6% spell hit) = 0.89<br>
<br>
    0.89*0.5 (50% damage from frost) = 0.445.<br>
<br>
    The game will roll a number between 0 and 1, and if it‘s less than 0.445, the frost bolt will hit for full damage. Otherwise, a resist message will appear.<br>
<br>
    2nd Example:<br>
<br>
    After the resist, Eyonix decides to fire a fireball at Yeti of Doom. Eyonix still has +6% spell hit. Fireball is not a binary spell. Here‘s the calculation:<br>
<br>
    0.83+0.06= 0.89<br>
<br>
    The game will roll a number between 0 and 1, and if its less than 0.89, the fireball will hit. Otherwise, a resist message will appear. After the fireball lands, the game will then apply spell resistance to determine a partial resist, if any. Assuming the yeti also has 50% fire resistance, on average, 50% of the damage will be resisted.<br>
<br>
    I hope that illuminates the impact of +spell hit gear on magical combat.

	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>For Binary spells the first equation is unbound (can give a result above 100) meaning that additional +hit will be applied towards the second part (which is why it acts like spell penetration).<br>

</div>Actually, empyrical evidence proves you wrong too.<br>
<br>
Historically TC has dictated that there is 'unmitigeable' partial resists which are level-based (ie: ~2% per +1 level, with ~5-6% partial resists on boss-level types). In practice, this has never been shown to be true, even despise the oft-cited blue example. I am talking here about binary spells, or frostbolt in particular.<br>
<br>
If binary spells are single-rolls, then you can conclude that, assuming 'unmitigeable' partial resists apply to them (corrolary: why shouldn't they ?), that binary spells should 'suffer' an extraneous 5-6% miss rate. In practice, I have <b>never</b> seen this to be the case. It used to be said, back in the day, that overflowing on hit rating (ie: &gt; 16%) was able to affect your 'unmitigeable' resists since it was a single-roll. Problem is, I have never seen evidence of that, or let alone see level-based resists affect binary spells.<br>
<br>
---<br>
Just to dispell some myth. If you check WWS you will see on average 4-5% fire partial resistance on bosses. This is because the shown damage on the combatlogs of partial resist hits don't take into account debuffs on the target (!). I have never verified it, but this is what I have read on the partial resistance thread. So the 4-5% combat-log-shown resistance is in fact higher than that in practice if the above is true, leading theorycally into the realms of the expected ~5-6% unmitigeable partial resistance on boss-level mobs.</div>

Don't know if somebody have payed attention to it but the conclusion from those over 1000 frostbolts for me is <br>

1) Either Blizzard ninja nurfed elem.prec. to its normal value of +3% hit<br>
2) Or they have implemented the same system Manly is talking about in the above post!<br>

Anyway I am depressed now, because i cannot figure out how to get all that lacking +hit, but still have in mind that there is a change in the +hit required for frost now.<br>

</div>I never said that Binary are single-roll.  I said that Binary functioms as a 2 roll system.  I know that the partial resists that are supposed to occur are missing but that doesn't mean that they aren't functional on a fight where the target actually has frost resistance.  I've been frost on rage without CoE and you will miss a literal shit ton on him which implies that while there may be something fishy going on with the level based resistances there is nothing wrong with how binary resists function on a target with actual resistances.<br>
<br>
Another thing to keep in mind is that due to those binary resistances any additional hit acts as spell penetration and that due to the 2 roll mechanic it actually would be able to remove those "unremovable" resistances.  Pretty sure that even 1 additional +hit would be enough to remove those resistances completely.<br>
<br>
<br>
As for where this all was proven.  There was a nice thread in the old forums prior to TBC that had a TC sticky and at the very end of it there was an experiment done by a couple of warlocks who took the time to prove/disprove how the binary spell mechanic functioned.  They sat down and put on resistance gear and varying degrees of hit gear and cast CoR and then CoS at each other and checked the resist rates and were able to get a sample size of a sufficient quantity that they proved that for binary spells additional hit acts like spell penetration.  <br>
<br>
If the mechanic was changed after TBC came out I really wouldn't know but since most testing of the mechanics with Frostbolt were done before people realized about the phantom hit associated with elemental precision it is quite possible that the reason no one saw the 5% miss predicated by those unremovable resistances is that they were wearing an overabundance of +hit to the point where those resists were being penetrated unknowingly.</div>

</div>Probably gonna get a warning for a useless post but you are, to put it quite simply, an idiot.<br>
<br>
I was Arc/Frost up till yesterday and I probably will be again too, so not sure where the hell convictions come into play.  You brought up a WWS to compare to yours saying "OOO look at me, I'm Arcane and I rocked the meters so much harder then that other other guild's fire mage even though he had better gear".<br>
<br>
Then we point out that Archi is not a good fight to make comparisons from, and you argue that.  Then I point out that your decursing sucked compared to the other mages, so you argued that.  Then I actually break down the dps and the actual raid groups and show that the other mage's performance was far superior to your own and now it's my convictions that are preventing me from seeing the brilliance that is you.<br>
<br>
Sorry but I think you really just need to take a moment to examine your own convictions and figure out why you are unable to come to grips with why your entire conceptualization of Arcane as the superior spec fails so miserably.</div>

		<div id="post_message_746078" class="post_message_underline">I think its because it just much easier to play fire well than to play arcane well. <br>
<br>
I see tons of mages in wow forums and even here who have obviously not raided as arcane. And even those that contemplate the spec from their eixisting frost or fire spec often do not have a clear idea of what makes that spec work. They are still trying to come up with some kind of set rotations, think rotations matter, and think they need to conserve mana through rotations so that they can spam AB during bloodlust. <br>
<br>
They are in fire gear emphasising +dmg,+hit, +haste, with low stats. And they wonder why they are doing so badly when they switch to arcane. <br>
<br>
It just reinforces even more steorotyped views about arcane which isn't needed.  Fire specs don't need to be explained. Every decent mage should know how to raid well with fire. Keep scorch up, fireball away, time your trinkets, destruction pots, etc with bloodlust and molten fury stage. <br>
<br>
But arcane spec raiding is not as well understood. Especially if its from mage who have never raided as arcane before. The legacy issues that cause AM spam to be popular in legacy patches, and complex AB cycles in others haven't helped and have been perpetuated by mages who are not up to date.  Not everyone has been reading and following all the mage TC threads on EJ forums from the very first page.<br>
<br>
Even the sweet information thread, is not very complete in that it doesn't address arcane spec raiding sufficiently. <br>
<br>
If arcane specs was just an oddball spec with no serious raid viability compared to fire. Then it probably wouldn't matter. But it isn't. Its a viable competitive raiding spec to fire. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses. So, the many misconeptions and failure to understand that AB spam is at the core of arcane raiding makes things worse.<br>
<br>
If everyone understood perfectly how to raid well as arcane. I would be very silent. But many mages don't. I believe even amongst the experts, there is some uncertainty on smaller issues like which spells to use as filler, whether it is truely best to gem for int,spirit vs damage. And to what extent haste rating is good for arcane. <br>
<br>
Fire specs don't need that much discussion or even explanation at this point. Are there really a lot of issues to clear up about how to raid well with fire or how to maximise fire dps? Arcane - there is not even any clear "accepted" method of how to raid well with arcane.  Some say alternate frostbolt/AB to always keep the debuff up, but still try and spam AB as much as possible. Others might say go with the two cycle theory. Spam AB, then use filler like frostbolt when low on mana only when necessary. Is there an "accepted" way of masimising arcane DPS agreed by all the experts here? There isn't. <br>
<br>
Is int, spirit accepted as the way to gem for arcane? Rawr shows that. But I rarely, if ever come across arcane mages that really out fit every single one of their slots with +int gems. Because int,spirit is only that good for the long fights. For the short fights, gemming +dmg is still better. <br>
<br>
Arcane deserves much more discussion than fire simply because it is not as well researched, not as well theorycrafted and not as well understood. The pity is that it always degenerates into a fire vs arcane argument. It shouldn't be at all. Arcane mages should be gathering together to try and figure out how to maximise arcane dps in all situations and how best to gear up for it in all situations. Not try to argue that their dps is better than fire.</div>

</div>I understand what you're saying, but I totally agree with Pintofbrew. There's been no serious discussion of arcane TC lately, for the past few months it's just been a stream of people with the same "I top meters in my guild as arcane so it's clearly the best spec" argument that was old months ago and is just stupid now. If there's a discussion taking place where something might actually be learned, I'm all for it, but that hasn't been the case really since 2.4 went live.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Also, you seriously need to understand that "gives him more mana than he can spend" does not apply to fire. Fire does not like remotely have mana issues.

	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Sorry to take you away from the unending Arcane vs Fire arguments, but I've seen you say this before, Manly, and I'm interested to know what you assume to make this judgment. The reason I ask is that my guild killed Illidan for the first time a month ago (so we normally do better than the examples I'm about to give) and I ran OOM on a pretty poor Teron kill last night that went for over six minutes. This is clearly not a regular lasting Teron fight but I potted twice, gemmed once, used a full 10 second evocate and used a flame cap near the end (before everyone started dying and we limped through to a kill - of course I had planned for a shorter fight and ended up OOM 30 seconds before the kill due to the flame cap). I did not have a shadow priest or a resto shaman, only a moonkin. The mana issues were hardly isolated to this fight - on Naj'entus I gemmed twice, potted twice, and got half an evocate during a shield <i>with</i> a shadow priest and still OOMed a few seconds before the end. This fight lasted a little over 5 minutes.<br>
<br>
Now obviously our fights take longer than yours would due to lower DPS (which also means the returns from a shadow priest are less as they do less damage themselves) but do your statements that a fire mage has nothing approaching mana issues assume sufficient DPS for a three minute Teron kill, a shadow priest, a resto shaman and chain potting which then doesn't even require an evocation? Or do you think a mage only gemming and evocating with no other synergy would be able to keep himself going?<br>
<br>
Obviously this question is a bit loaded, but some sort of statement from Manly (and other high end mages) would be useful for a lot of people to show their guilds in case that mages do have mana issues outside of decent group setups and where the guild DPS is lower than that of the top end guilds where mages might in fact have no mana issues.<br>
<br>
[Disclaimer: I'm in no way trying to foster the already terrible Arcane vs. Fire arguments - I've played arcane for a week or two but respecced fire due to arcane having even more emphasis on the terrible mechanic that is mana. I'd love for Blizzard to give us some sort of interesting mechanic like Rage or Energy or Runes but I guess that ship's already sailed.]</div>

</div>I cant believe this is getting blown out of proportion like this. I actually am losing faith with EJ... Which I didn't think was possible because normally its so good.<br>
<br>
You have patronisingly assumed that I am some bone-headed arcane wannabe, not the TCing no-lifer that I actually am. I have tried all specs and all rotations from within a raiding environment, and would not be here posting if I didn't know what I was talking about.<br>
<br>
You have <b> assumed </b> that because I linked the wws that I think that Archimonde is a fight where dps is more important than decursing. You were wrong. And you  (plural) refuse to accept it.<br>
<br>
You also still pertain to understand arcane as it is in 2.4 ; which you clearly don't. I could put the time and effort into explaining my posts and proving to you that you're wrong. But I think for once I'm actually going to let you guys think what you like.<br>
<br>
I came back to raiding a few weeks/months ago as 2.3 hit - new gems, new nerfed evocate, new mana regen from int/spirit - and on my own came up with the spec that I thought was the best. This then became the "2/48/11" spec and I found out that I wasn't the only one to see the positives of icy veins and having all the fire damage trees.<br>
To now have evolved into a spec that suits soo many fights pre-sunwell, and have it perform so well with what (for me) used to be a relatively poor gear level, which totally contradicts the old thinking regarding the gear required for the old rotations ; with such clear benefits on some fights, and then to have more than one of you totally miss the sentiment of my post ; label me an "arcane flag waver" - and call me an idiot - shows just how weak your argument(s) is/are.<br>
<br>
To actually make out like Teron is a better fight to compare DPS on I find amusing, since on Teron I use iceblock to help healers when I get incinerated (losing AB debuff and having to sit through the painful bugged re-stacking, or interweave frostbolts even when I have enough mana to warrant AB spam) sometimes twice ; which [seeing as you've raided as arcane Rounced] you know messes with when you might want to use cold snap, and when you ideally can from a dps-perspective...<br>
<br>
But its too late. Damage is done. As has been shown you aren't likely to re-assess me and its a shame to think that your understanding of arcane is so poor. <br>
<br>
BTW ; To hopefully move the dicussion on slightly ; does anyone else feel severely hampered by the new spell queue system? I do not trust it especially during times of excessive haste (close to, on, or below the 1 second gcd) and rather than be duped into thinking I'm casting 1 second casts and actually (through the magic of server/client confusion) be given 1.05 or 1.1 second casts - I'd rather switch to other spells that avoid getting the "That spell is not ready yet" error. I never like to let my client think for itself, and hence still use quartz (and for some things like ice lance, for farming) a stopcast macro.<br>
Or.. conversely... from some decent testing... has it been shown to correctly work in all scenarios and actually be the basis for a caster revolution in terms of not needing quartz/stopcasting?</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Arcane deserves much more discussion than fire simply because it is not as well researched, not as well theorycrafted and not as well understood. The pity is that it always degenerates into a fire vs arcane argument. It shouldn't be at all. Arcane mages should be gathering together to try and figure out how to maximise arcane dps in all situations and how best to gear up for it in all situations. Not try to argue that their dps is better than fire.</div>

	</tbody></table>
</div>Well, the problem is that people are bringing the wrong arguments. There are upsides to every spec, but people trying to vouch for arcane give the arguments that don't matter. Or my favorite people trying to ague about fire spec mana.<br>
<br>
With this said, I think this is kind of the unease of talking about arcane is that everything is situational. Everything comes into play. Mana tide, spriest dps, JOW, number of innervates, fight duration will totally change the numbers. Then I don't think many mages will agree that going full int gemming is 'acceptable' in the sense that - while optimal, it is basically 'single-sided' gemming that won't work on any other spec. I think the playstyle of arcane is quite simply all about understanding DPM. The guideline isn't hard at all. I think what kind of is missing is strategies/methodologies about how to  plan your DPM ahead of time. This is something I would instinctively do, if I were to start play arcane seriously. But oddly enough it seems like nobody took the time to put more than basic outline about how to play arcane. Or maybe just everyone assumes that understanding how tools like rawr/magegraf is what it takes to know how to play, and maybe that looking at the result is good enough to satisfy most peoples desire to play well? (again, this is pure speculation).</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Sorry to take you away from the unending Arcane vs Fire arguments, but I've seen you say this before, Manly, and I'm interested to know what you assume to make this judgment. The reason I ask is that my guild killed Illidan for the first time a month ago (so we normally do better than the examples I'm about to give) and I ran OOM on a pretty poor Teron kill last night that went for over six minutes. This is clearly not a regular lasting Teron fight but I potted twice, gemmed once, used a full 10 second evocate and used a flame cap near the end (before everyone started dying and we limped through to a kill - of course I had planned for a shorter fight and ended up OOM 30 seconds before the kill due to the flame cap). I did not have a shadow priest or a resto shaman, only a moonkin. The mana issues were hardly isolated to this fight - on Naj'entus I gemmed twice, potted twice, and got half an evocate during a shield <i>with</i> a shadow priest and still OOMed a few seconds before the end. This fight lasted a little over 5 minutes.<br>
<br>
Now obviously our fights take longer than yours would due to lower DPS (which also means the returns from a shadow priest are less as they do less damage themselves) but do your statements that a fire mage has nothing approaching mana issues assume sufficient DPS for a three minute Teron kill, a shadow priest, a resto shaman and chain potting which then doesn't even require an evocation? Or do you think a mage only gemming and evocating with no other synergy would be able to keep himself going?<br>
<br>
Obviously this question is a bit loaded, but some sort of statement from Manly (and other high end mages) would be useful for a lot of people to show their guilds in case that mages do have mana issues outside of decent group setups and where the guild DPS is lower than that of the top end guilds where mages might in fact have no mana issues.<br>
<br>
[Disclaimer: I'm in no way trying to foster the already terrible Arcane vs. Fire arguments - I've played arcane for a week or two but respecced fire due to arcane having even more emphasis on the terrible mechanic that is mana. I'd love for Blizzard to give us some sort of interesting mechanic like Rage or Energy or Runes but I guess that ship's already sailed.]</div>

</div>Well, from my experience, besides ROS phase 2, I've rarely ever, since TBC came out, ran into mana issues. Maybe on the first few morogrim, but that is about it. I am not sure if I can put it more bluntly. Besides things like mana draining mobs its not really something that happens. I do run in the assumption that shadow priest is always provided, and we've always opted strategies that you won't run into mana issues (ie: use 1 mage to do all the morogrim aoe). I think the only time where mana seemed like a real issue was like when we were starting m'uru and assumed hey maybe if we aoe for 5-7 minutes this might be doable, which clearly would not have been remotely doable as firespec. Of course, we didn't go for that, since its simply not doable.<br>
<br>
If anything as you clear the places for months after a while you'll get to see what I mean. It shouldn't take too long either (unless you have like really bad spriests). Sadly I am not sure what to add - firespec mana consumption should be close to brainless and rarely come into play.</div>

</div>Sure, go ahead. Personally I think theses forums just give a baseline about how to play properly (and yes even for firespec). A lot of grounds are not covered about how to abuse every single nuance of mechanics in the game, but I think ultimately everyone has some learning process you learn along the way. Sometimes I get specific questions about how to stack cooldowns, but the truth is, every answer will depend on the situation at hand. I somewhat enjoy keeping tabs on my haste ratings and how it affects possible spell-chainings giving rolling ignites, but for all practical means for me its nothing more than a TC curiosity. I do try to abuse rolling ignites on movement fights, but thats about as far as 'abusing rolling ignites' go.</div>

		<div id="post_message_746227" class="post_message_underline" style="min-height: 183px;">I think I broke the game.<br>
I've been playing around with Rawr lately and decided to see if it's possible to actually make <i>Pyroblast</i> the mage's main-cast spell for dps. If this were to happen, you'd have to reduce the cast time to 3 seconds, like that of a talented fireball. Then you'd need a shadow priest or two to make up the mana cost difference. But I wanted to do it and <u>remain hit capped.</u> Here's where the fun began.<br>
<br>
<b>Rules I made for myself</b><br>
1. Socket only haste gems to the maximum amount possible. I chose Quick Lionseye because they provide the most haste.<br>
2. Remain hit capped or within .5% of the fire cap.<br>
3. Use any piece of gear from any instance in any combination. If you're going all out, why not take down all the bosses in the game while you're at it.<br>
4. If you cannot gain hit cap from gear, only then did I want to rely on an elemental shaman.<br>
<br>
Here's what I got:<br>
Helm- Hood of Hexing [3x Quick Lionseye] {Glyph of Power enchant}<br>
Neck- Sunfire Pendant [Quick Lionseye]<br>
Shoulder- Amice of the Convoker [2x Quick Lionseye]<br>
Back- Shroud of the Highborne (MAXIMUM HASTE ON A CLOAK ZOMG) {Subtlety enchant}<br>
Chest- Sunfire Robe [3x Quick Lionseye] {+6 stats enchant}<br>
Wrist- Bracers of Nimble Thought {15 spell damage enchant}<br>
Gloves- Gloves of Tyri's Power [2x Quick Lionseye] {15 spell hit rating enchant}<br>
Waist- Belt of the Tempest [Quick Lionseye]<br>
Legs- Leggings of Calamity [3x Quick Lionseye] {Runic Spellthread}<br>
Feet- Boots of the Tempest [Quick Lionseye] {Vitality enchant}<br>
Weapon(s)- Grand Magister's Staff of Torrents [3x Quick Lionseye] {Sunfire enchant}<br>
Ranged- Wand of the Demonsoul [Quick Lionseye]<br>
Trinkets- Skull of Gul'dan and Quagmirran's Eye<br>
<br>
TOTALS WITH ONLY AI and MOLTEN ARMOR:<br>
8203 Health<br>
10736 Mana<br>
<br>
22.32% spell crit (245 crit rating)<br>
<b>547 Spell haste rating</b><br>
1198 Fire spell damage<br>
<b>164 Spell hit rating</b><br>
<br>
Now with an ele shaman, you could use Blade of Twisted Visions and Heart of the Pit for more haste and change your glove enchant to damage.<br>
<br>
I don't know the conversions of haste (1 rating = ??%) but I'm pretty sure 547 haste would be close enough to make pyroblast viable. Comments?<br>
<br>
<br>
P.S. I'm not a math god, I'm horrible at theorycrafting. So any replies limited in math or with long, drawn-out explanations to the math wold be appreciated.<br>
<br>
/EDIT: My spell damage math is off, I forgot to remove the Flask of Pure Death in Rawr. It should be 1118 fire damage. My bad.</div>

</div>You realise that with a 3 second pyroblast, you'd have a 1.5 second fireball?<br>
To make Pyroblast spam viable, it would need a 1 second cast time, which is ~7800 haste rating. Good luck getting there <br>
<br>
And even then, Fireball still scales better due to 4T6, Pyroblast is still better due to the higher base damage though.</div>

		<div id="post_message_746251" class="post_message_underline" style="min-height: 183px;">I have a haste-related question (spent some time reading this thread, but can't find the answer). Won't haste-heavy gear setup actually hurt fire mage's DPS due to going OOM fast? <br>
<br>
The point is that ever since 2.3, I've being a haste adept in our guild, and on every good occasion try to tell ppl how good haste is for casters. The question I asked is an argument against haste that one of our guild's mages told me. Would be really great, if you adviced me how to counter this, or actually proved that I am being wrong. Sorry for asking possibly obvious things, but my main and only character is a shadowpriest and I know little to nothing about mages and their mana efifciency. <br>
<br>
From a shadowpriest perspective (I'm an active participant of shadowpriest.com forums), there were lots or arguments against haste, with most popular being: ruining rotations and lowering mana efficiency. However, now both things are not considered to be a problem, and high-end priests are sitting at 200-300 spellhaste. Of course, haste stacking spawns some less obvious issues, e.g. 1 haste vs 1dmg usefullness ratio decay with increasing haste values, but these are unnecessary details in the context of my original question.</div>

</div>I like the way you've put this. Only addition I would make is that if you aim to decurse as much as possible, trying to beat all around you - then chances are if they for some reason get an issue, you will get the successful curse and the person has a higher chance to live. But irrelevant ; decurse is priority and I thought it was an assumption made by all regarding that fight, prior to b) staying alive by whatever means necesary and c) nuking your tits off when possible.<br>

</div>I do yes, though I wonder whether I should interrupt my casting (especially on the slow as hell frostbolts...) to decurse sooner. I take on-board your point that the curses is announced but timers can be off, and I'd much rather have the option of interrupting or continuining a 1.5 second cast than a 3 second cast. I fail to see how being 1 second into a fireball and 1 second into an AB and having a curse land on your partner is anything other than MUCH better for the arcane mage. Half a second and I'm decursing, having cast ; there is much less of a decision? As fire I would walk out of the cast in this situation, probably.<br>

</div>Can only agree with that - and I've said restacking AB is an issue - however - have u never had more than one mage had to bandage in a fight? (Risking scorch fall off) -- In world of theorycraft no the scorch debuff shouldn't fall off - and generally we have several fire mages keeping it up (yes this is lower over dps but only fractionally) ; but if it does, the dps loss while its stack and during the time its off, its a huge difference to anyone doing fire damage in the raid, not just the mages. The point remains that if AB falls off ; we can make up the difference because during the time we've been - getting a CR, getting bandaged, iceblocking to save our ass etc - we have regenned mana. Fire has no way to make up lost time - because as you have said many times ; you have no mana issues. Which means for every fight you will almost <i>ever</i> play as fire, you're chain casting the whoooole time. This means that if you get death and decayed, then have to bandage, then have to iceblock and somehow, through bad luck, the same has happened to other mages, and scorch falls off - a) you've got oodles more mana that you cannot use (arcane can) and b) dps loss caused by all mages hastily restacking scorch (x3 to be sure, x4 perhaps if they're looking at other things) is far outweighed by delay in restacking AB debuff, primarily because we can then make use of the regenned mana with more AB spam. (which on Rage isn't really an issue - altho with molten armor on Rage I still got outdamaged by a rogue so I need to work out how that happened)<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Also, you seriously need to understand that <i>"gives him more mana than he can spend"</i> does not apply to fire. Fire does not like remotely have mana issues. The only time I use evocation is after phase 2 on Illidan and maybe* kaz'rogal if I don't get any resist. Fire does not have mana issues, and <i>always</i> has more mana than it can spend. Movement does not affects that.</div>

</div>Manly I have a lot of respect for you, so I'm going to blame the way that I have written it not anything else. But I do not know how you are misunderstanding me ; but I can only explain it better. When I say "gives him more mana than he can spend" I mean exactly that you do NOT have mana issues. Quite the contrary. I never used to need to evocate as fire, I never used to really need to remake my gems, I never used to really need to use mana pots on every CD (though I did perhaps due to poor SPs or lack of them). I even spent a day with Dr Boom a loooong time ago (back when I was only reading EJ and not posting in the middle of last year) having regemmed from crit to damage gems and back again, with molten and with mage - to see whether the mana returns from crit were worthwhile. I understand fire, and I know that you cannot spend the blue stuff. I have never, and until something drastic changes, will never think that fire has a mana problem. <br>
<br>
OK?<br>
Now ; the problem that you lot (and I will do when I hit 4xT6 and Sunwell progression) have is that you cannot make use of incoming mana. Arcane mages can. By potting, using evocation and gems productively, we can turn all the incoming mana into reduced threat damage. You cannot. If you finish a boss with half a mana bar - that is mana that an arcane mage would have been able to make use of. Whether you have done more or less damage than him is irrelevant for the moment. I was frustrated with ALWAYS having mana left at the end of a boss fight, and my instincts telling me that a mana dump such as AB could be put to use here.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Fire mages have trinkets, drums, molten fury (yes, this is a cooldown for all means and purposes), combustion, icy veins, bloodlust, flame cap and destruction potion. Thats a lot more than just combustion and icy veins. And on the contrary to your claim, I believe that fire mages are better suited to fit any situation than an arcane mage for the simple reason that we have a stronger and more flexible arsenal of spells. I'm talking {arcane blast, frostbolt and arcane explosion <b>[EDIT _ JaMMi_ Arcane power, presence of mind, cold snap} </b>vs {scorch, fireball, fireblast, dragon's breath, blastwave, arcane explosion}. <br>
I am not denying that having a 1.5s cast time main spell has its advantages, but it won't magically make you the most flexible by virtue of having a short cast time. I am not arguing about threat - in my experience it has rarely been an issue save on eredar twins reverse order.</div>

</div>Now we're getting to the issue of how to spend that mana. Drums, haste on gear, heroism ; all facilitate the spending of that spare mana that we all agree fire mages have. In fact heroism to be honest is a hindrance to me because it gives me less regen time for the time same amount of damage. I mostly pop AB/trinket and frosbolt spam during heroism, with an AB thrown in to keep the debuff up, knowing that after the heroism I'll be back to having to manage the regen that for the rest of the fight I've been used to. Heroism is a dream to fire mages because it lets them spend the mana reserves they have. Without it, you are subpar. The same is not true of an arcane mage without a shadowpriest PRE-sunwell, PRE-4xT6.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">What does it matter whether you can go 'nuts' only at the final 20% or on the entirety of the fight ? All that matters is final damage. And for what its worth, arcane is restrained to pop its cooldown during bloodlust, not exactly 'at any given time'. Which kinds of goes back to what I was saying: "what does it matter <i>when</i> you can go nuts?". Both fire and arcane depends on when bloodlust is activated.</div>
			
		</td>

	</tbody></table>
</div>Arcane is TOTALLY not restricted to popping its cooldowns during bloodlust. In fact the whole beauty and beast of the arcane spec is knowing when to popping cooldowns ; and believe me ; heroism is a kick in the face when they are not available and/or you need regen time. FIRE is the spec that must keep its cooldowns for heroism ; and must beg the shamans to do it significantly later into the start of a fight due to threat (which you never had an issue with, perhaps, but the rest of us do) OR at sub-20%. <br>
Which basically says ; arcane is better for progressing with bosses because until you get below 20% we are subpar. Not once have I heard a raid leader say (Get him to 20% lads then its easy mode because the mages execute).<br>
<br>
The fact is that I as arcane am constantly watching my mana and the raids mana - When i see the opportunity to AB spam with AP up - (SP is having a good day at the office and somehow my mana bar is staying fairly constant even though I'm AB spamming and have been since the start of the fight ; I know I've got mana pot and mana gem off've cooldown and I can afford to lose the mana from AB/AP/trinket spam with icy veins up) - I do it. This is rare. Mostly I will start AB spamming and watch my mana, then use icy veins (the first of two) with AP and trinket - and do something like 9:1 AB:FrB so that I can see how much my mana drops, whilst maintaining AB debuff, and also seeing how my mana bar  drops. If heroism suddenly goes off ; I'll switch to something like 1AB:5FrB but again the ratio will change depending on how close I am to a pot cooldown.<br>
<br>
I am wracking my brain trying to think of a way of process-flowing the way a true arcane mage manages the abilities he has available ; and I can only guess is something akin to the hunter timelines and squeezing abilities into certain time slots.<br>
<br>
The start of a fight I have mana pot cd, mana gem cd and evocate available = high mana useage mode.<br>
As soon as possible, I use mana pot, then gem ; both of which ideally return me to approximately 99% mana (ish).<br>
Within this time, depending on movement, (as you say it affects us, but not as MUCH as fire - Ill explain I hope), having to use pom while moving, having to avoid using AP due to risk of being feared / stunned / silenced etc - my mana regen could be very high (If SP hasn't had to move, im within range of totems, heroism hasn't been used etc) or it could be very low. If its very low, I will be in a situation where I have to consider the fact that I have no mana pot for a while, no mana gem for a while, and I don't really want to use evocate so quickly into the fight. I also have cold snap off cd and ideally I want it on cd asap so that it can come off again sooner. (Again iceblock being used adds weight to the use of cold snap early argument ; so the difference between getting incinerate at Teron, early on, makes the decision to use Cold Snap an easy one).<br>
<br>
I'm going to try and think of a way to explain the arcane thought processes behind all this as I continue to raid using this spec. Education &gt; all... And only when we're on the same page can we correctly debate it. At the moment you guys truly do not understand AB/FrB raiding ; and how it affects your gear choice (I recently swapped from +40 damage on weapon to +30 int ; not because rawr told me it did more damage, but because in the event of lacking an SP I want to know the regen is there, and when a SP IS present, I can easily convert extra incoming mana into damage. Also using intellect to boost by AB spam uptime reduces my threat overall. Using frostbolt fillers causes too much threat during AP/trinket/icy veins spam phases), which I'm sorry but you guys are really behind in your understanding.<br>
<br>
I exist in a world where I get Anetheron's Noose drop, and though rawr tells me the higher dps gems for it are +12x2, I choose to use +10int and +10 spirit because they're second best (1.7 dps behind on the comparison chart) but with the former I get higher threat lower regen (more FrB uptime due to lower overall mana) and with the latter I get more regen (= more AB uptime, more regen during run phases [Supremus/Archi], more options available perhaps on the really arcane favoured fights [like Supremus] to use molten armor and have no mana issues] etc etc etc.<br>
<br>
And ; to get back to the tongue-in-cheek baiting ; 3k dps on MH trash last night [10 million damage, 3k dps average] ; beat that fire boys! [Proviso ; Perhaps these pointless elements of banter merely serve to make me look like a plonker, and detract from the serious dicussion I'm trying to evolve and develop above.. however... I find myself unable to resist trying to elicit at least a wry smile from the mages who I've come to respect so much on these forums... Please.. just "lol" and ignore them :P]</div>

</div>No - actually its a significant boost.<br>
If you regularly group with mage's that are fire (2/48/11 is what they should be) and would experience mana problems (mana problems for fire = being low on mana at any point really, except as Manly mentioned on Morogrim when they have to AoE [lacking clearcasting]) if they stacked haste ; then <br>
a) You're not doing your job as shadowpriest [ let's assume you are because you're here asking to help them! = &lt;3]<br>
b) They are not using mana potions when they're off cooldown [ Which is a nice trade-off really ; Stack haste, use pot ; or don't stack haste and not need to -- basically its paying for pots,  to do more damage]<br>
c) They're not remaking their 3x mana emerald mid-fight. This has been said mulitple times to be the better option than using the lower rank mana gems.<br>
<br>
That's pretty much it really.<br>
<br>
As fire, mana is never really an issue. Haste is fantastic for a fire mage because it gives them the opportunity to turn spare mana ; into damage. <br>
<br>
The only suggestion I would make, is that they do not simply re-gem to improve haste count; but create a new set with hasted gear items. If they stack haste as much as possible, and you're not available to raid, then perhaps, perhaps ( depending on how extreme they go) they might experience issues ; but I'd be very surprised.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Sorry to take you away from the unending Arcane vs Fire arguments, but I've seen you say this before, Manly, and I'm interested to know what you assume to make this judgment. The reason I ask is that my guild killed Illidan for the first time a month ago (so we normally do better than the examples I'm about to give) and I ran OOM on a pretty poor Teron kill last night that went for over six minutes. This is clearly not a regular lasting Teron fight but I potted twice, gemmed once, used a full 10 second evocate and used a flame cap near the end (before everyone started dying and we limped through to a kill - of course I had planned for a shorter fight and ended up OOM 30 seconds before the kill due to the flame cap). <b>I did not have a shadow priest or a resto shaman, </b>only a moonkin. The mana issues were hardly isolated to this fight - on Naj'entus I gemmed twice, potted twice, and got half an evocate during a shield <i>with</i> a shadow priest and still OOMed a few seconds before the end. This fight lasted a little over 5 minutes.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>That's all you need to know as your answer to the question of "how can you say you have no mana issues?".<br>
<br>
Fire is clean cut and simple in that it (a) either has an SP and does not have a mana issue or (b) does not have an SP and can't cope or (c) has some other mana source that isn't an SP and barely copes, but has to select some form of regen over some form of dps, depending on occasion (ie, gems over caps, pots over d-pots etc.)<br>
<br>
As for the gentleman who came up with "I see many mages on WoW forums and this one" could you please amend your oppinion to "many morons on wow forums, and some who nobody cares about on this one". Manly correctly identifies: You're all going amok about arcane-hating, which doesn't exist in EJ, and then spewing any and every excuse you can find to "defend" it against some immaginary assault. <br>
<br>
This thread is starting to feel like getting on the bus and seeing a man with a chainsaw and a crazy look sit opposite you going "I'ma readeh for yeh". The only people worked-up and seemingly inexhaustibly aggressive are the pro-arcane posters fighting their crusade against a non-existent threat, while the vast majority of us not only acknowledge arcane as viable and preferential, occasionally superior to fire in certain aspects, but moreover DON'T CARE for comparing the specs, because largely IT'S IRRELEVANT. We can all perfectly well see Pushback, CD stacking, OO5SR, Range and all the other bullshit that we keep seeing mega-posts about our selves, thanks.</div>

Okay, we've thrown out pyroblast spam completely. Now how about using all the gear listed above and doing the normal scorch/fireball rotation until Bloodlust or IV and then spamming pyroblast? I'm not sure on the math for this one, either, but if you stack both of them, you'd have maybe a 1.7ish cast time on Pyroblast compared to the GCD-locked fireball.

And don't use the 4T6 argument, since it's irrelevant in this gear set-up. I'm asking if you were actualy crazy enough to stack this much haste and compare the two.<br>

</div>Ok so, in short, you're telling me that arcane wins out whenever its doing something that isn't dps because it regens more mana and has more opportunity to take advantage of that. Well, I knew that. Again, all that this is saying is 'all specs work differently, arcane does a better job when not dpsing [than the other specs]'.<br>
<br>
Also, all specs are reliant on bloodlust, for the simple reason that <b>bloodlust increases your DPS and DPM</b>. It increases DPM indirectly by virtual of allowing more casts while under other cooldowns, such as hex shrunken head, or molten fury. As such, arcane is reliant on it. Good luck proving me wrong on that. (I mean it)<br>
<br>
A minor detail:<br>
<i>"EDIT _ JaMMi_ Arcane power, presence of mind, cold snap"</i><br>
Those don't apply. POM is not flexible because it is on cooldown, and AP/CS doesn't affect the flexibility of your spells. If you were to include those, I would include combustion since technically its an awesome AOE tool, but it doesn't really help at all my flexibility.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic"> does anyone else feel severely hampered by the new spell queue system? I do not trust it especially during times of excessive haste (close to, on, or below the 1 second gcd) and rather than be duped into thinking I'm casting 1 second casts and actually (through the magic of server/client confusion) be given 1.05 or 1.1 second casts - I'd rather switch to other spells that avoid getting the "That spell is not ready yet" error. I never like to let my client think for itself, and hence still use quartz (and for some things like ice lance, for farming) a stopcast macro.<br>
Or.. conversely... from some decent testing... has it been shown to correctly work in all scenarios and actually be the basis for a caster revolution in terms of not needing quartz/stopcasting?</div>

	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>The mechanic is not actually a spell queuing system, per se.  How it works is they unlocked your client to be able to send cast messages to the server all the time without any interference of the GCD or the client limiting when the messages could be sent.  This means that using /stopcasting is most likely a loss of dps since you get a better effect by merely spamming the button near where Quartz shows your latency to be and you get the exact same result that /stopcasting used to give without the possibility of interrupting a cast before it completes.<br>
<br>
If you want to time your casts you can always do so but, and this especially true when hasted near the 1.0 second cast time, you are better off doing the spam thing since then your message is more likely to be at the server the moment the server determines that it is eligible to cast the next spell.<br>
<br>
They did seem to add a small amount of leeway to the system as well where it does not count as a queue but where the server will accept messages a little bit prior to the actual end of the casting time, but that is more about smoothing out the mechanic for people who prefer to hit the button once as opposed to spamming it.  This leeway is probably in the realm of 50ms and as far as I know has never been definitively tested for or proven but is more anecdotal in existence, based on a post from the UI developer and just from how seamless the system currently functions under most circumstances.</div>

</div>As far as I know there is no spellqueue. However, I did see some apalling results pointing towards having one of sort. If only there existed one sure-fire way to test this. Maybe someone with 10-15ms connection and a G15 ? In any case, if there is a spell queue, the window of opportunity for chain cast value is set rather low, probably around the 50ms you have hinted (which is somewhat stupid when you think about it -- thats faster than most players press keys).</div>

</div>I think that this is consistent with what I've been seeing. I'm still not 100% I trust it though. For example today I walked out of a cast to pom sheep something and it took a ridiculous amount of time for pom to register. It was like the server/client conversation went something like this (again in Jam language):<br>
"I want to cast arcane blast"<br>
"Ok well, have a gcd"<br>
"Please wait towards the end of my arcane blast I need you to accept my next spell ; oh wait I've cancelled - await further instructions"<br>
"Ok so you want me to wait at the end of your arcane-"<br>
"POM please"<br>
"No wait hold up what did you say before? Oh you cancelled your arc - ohhh you want to POM"<br>
<br>
Very annoying. I'm not sure if I prefer the old system to the new one to be honest. <br>
<br>
On a different note - (One which if they have to fix one of these two issues I'd rather they fix this one first...)<br>
I definitely am getting frustrated with the stacking bug. In heroics I find myself just frostbolting for the purity of knowing your next cast isn't going to cost more mana than it should relative to the cast time. I suppose I can only hope that the Dev's do see it as a genuine bug and can look to rectify it shortly.<br>
A simple work-around they could use would be to get the client to send the message, when AB is cast, "haste all subsequent spells by &lt;insert relevant AB haste factor here&gt; ; if the next spell you receive is not AB ; initiate a suitable delay before permitting the next cast. ie ; the AB debuff becomes a global haste / global delay function... and if you for some reason get a hasted scorch (or whatever) as a result - then you simply get a delay after it has registered and your next cast is permissable.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the info on the spell relationship since 2.3 though.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Back to the pyroblast discussion.<br>
<br>
Okay, we've thrown out pyroblast spam completely. Now how about using all the gear listed above and doing the normal scorch/fireball rotation until Bloodlust or IV and then spamming pyroblast? I'm not sure on the math for this one, either, but if you stack both of them, you'd have maybe a 1.7ish cast time on Pyroblast compared to the GCD-locked fireball. Wouldn't it be that the base-bonus damage of pyro would outweigh the fireball?<br>
<br>
And don't use the 4T6 argument, since it's irrelevant in this gear set-up. I'm asking if you were actualy crazy enough to stack this much haste and compare the two.<br>
<br>
P.S. Alliance mages can stack up to 570 haste gear and remain hit capped with a draenei ele shaman. Horde cannot, sadly.</div>

Your setup has 1118 fire damage. Makes ... 1358 raid buffed?<br>
Fireball/Pyroblast both scale with 115%.<br>
<br>
Fireball thus does 735+1.15*1358 = 2297 damage, Pyroblast does 1065+1.15*1358 = 2627 damage.<br>
<br>
If Pyroblast is to be better than Fireball, Fireball will have a 1.0s cast time limit (the GCD) doing 2297 DPS (before modifiers), and Pyro thus has to cast faster than 2627/2297*1s = 1.1437 seconds.<br>
<br>
So, Pyro is only useful if you drop below 1.15s cast time for it, which requires +422% haste.<br>
With IV/Bloodlust, you'd need +235% haste from gear, or around 3680 haste rating. Enjoy collecting </div>

</div><br>
First off the tongue-in-cheek baiting is completely unnecessary and really does make you look like a "plonker".  It doesn't elicit a wry smile, it elicits an annoyed groan and really frustrates any attempts to take what you say at all seriously.<br>
<br>
Secondly I was Arc/Frost for long enough to have gone through MH that way and to see every fight up through the Twins as that spec and in regards to the AoE trash in MH the key to topping the meters (as if it really mattered anyway) was not being Arc/Frost but more about who did the first AE.  I was the only Arc/Frost mage running with 2 Fire mages and during trash we all alternated around the top 5 spots but none of it mattered anyway.<br>
<br>
There are only 2 real advantages to being Arc/Frost.   That's it, only 2, and they are not the shorter casting times, not freedom to move more, not being able to drain your mana faster, the only advantages whatsoever that it brings is that it doesn't require 3 debuff slots per mage to do it's dps and that it doesn't require CoE to be truly competitive.<br>
<br>
That's not a small advantage, btw, in an already crowded aspect of the game not needing COE and not using any debuff slots gives other classes opportunities to apply more debuffs and that gives the spec it's validity.  Ask the rogues how much they like having to pull off deadly poison to conserve debuff slots.  Too bad so many mages are limited to looking at the meters to see how their personal performance is not how they are aiding the raid as a whole.<br>
<br>
So then it comes down to a determination of which is more important, properly supporting the Arc/Frost mage by giving him the mana to be competitive and then making use of the debuff slots freed up, or having a mage that doesn't require anywhere near the same amount of support to be viable but who uses up 3 precious debuff slots to do their dps.  As for what is better at that point in the discussion is completely between the individual mage and their raid leader and the raid as a whole.<br>
<br>
<br>
Final note, there is a new Arcane mage TC thread, discussions of Arcane viability should probably be moved over to there.</div>

		<div id="post_message_746883" class="post_message_underline">Good day to all,<br>
<br>
As an avid reader of those boards i would like to remind you of the influence you guys have over the mage community. It might not be my place to say this, and i know this post has nothing to do with TC but I think it is still worth reminding all of you.<br>
<br>
Most of us, will not see the content you guys have on farm, for that matter most of us don't even have the resources necessary to get there, you are the elite of the raiding community. So when you guys say the fire spec doesn't have mana issues, or that it is the best raid dps spec bar non for high end raiding the people that read these boards forget that all those calculations are made under close to optimal circumstances and roll with that. It then trickles down to the wow mage forums and into the forums of various lower guilds and all the nuances you guys take for granted are forgotten.<br>
<br>
<br>
As an example i would like to mention a recent argument I had with another mage from my guild recently (3 bosses dead in MH and BT). He was arguing that i was wasting my time with arcane/frost because i could do more damage with fire and he started to quote these boards and sent me various links to your discussions and so on. But what he failed to realize is that for almost all of you guys 4 pieces of tier 6 is a given as well as a SP and COE not to mention bloodlust at 20% and the list goes on. But for a guild like ours who only has 1 elemental shamman and a single SP reserved for healers as well as 2 semi-selfish locks (cor and cos only) things are not optimal and the edge a fire mage gets with all of these vs an arcane one is lost. Even worse he ends up going oom more often than i because he can't go into mana preservation mode but I can so he ends up having a better dps but i end having more damage done when that happens.<br>
<br>
So please keep that in mind when you guys duel over which spec does what, i know there are various help pls threads for the mage noob, i read them all, but isn't it customary when you publish results from researches to describe under what circumstances those findings were obtained?</div>

</div>That's not exactly true.  This is the number you would need for Pyroblast *spam* to be effective, so you get no DOT ticks.  With this level of spell damage, you would get a DPS boost if you could get Pryo to about 1.4-1.5 sec cast.  The trick would be to pyro, then fireball until the pyro DOT runs out, then pyro again.  So you only need about ~2500 haste + IV/BL to for Pyroblast to have a use in raids.<br>
<br>
Comedy aside, Pyroblast is just a stupidly designed spell.  It should have a base cast of 4.5 and probably also a bigger scaling on the DOT damage (35%, up from 20%).  Then it would occasionally make sense to rotate it in with your fireballs and let the DOT.  It wouldn't break anything since the rare situations in which it is useful now (POM, Zul'jin phase 3, pulling a mage tank target, pulling when solo/leveling) are the ones in which cast time is pretty much irrelevant - it would hardly get better in these circumstances.<br>
<br>
It is in no danger of ever being spammable.  Even with both of my changes, Pyro rotation just barely beats fireball spam if you get a full run of the DOT *and* your spell damage is not too high.  And, no, this does not change for any possible amount of haste.</div>

		<div id="post_message_747289" class="post_message_underline">So I assume it's safe for us to say Pyroblast should never be used in a non-arcane mage's raiding cycles. A shame Blizzard made it suck so badly, it would really be an amazing spell if it were a shorter cast time.  Oh well. Going back to the gear set-up above (Sorry to keep dragging you guys back to this), how's it stack up against 4T6? I don't exactly know the math, but I've read a few times that haste = ~1.25 spell damage. So if you swapped out all the Lionseyes to Reckless Pyrestones, couldn't this set-up possibly be comparable to 4T6? Or no?<br>
<br>

Haven't seen many mages using it on this encounter, but isn't this a huge buff to your dps (4 instant pyros)???<br>
<br>
Ofcourse you will need to lose 4%crit on scourch and 1% from playing with fire but still, isn't the dmg gain from all those instant pyros a huge buff to a mage dps ? Saying this because we are keeping the caster mobs there alive and kill them last only so the mages can spellsteal as many times as possible and increase their overall dmg on M'uru.</div>

</div>The comparison I made was NOT using sunfire chest, and i just noticed in my original post I said spellfire.  Also, if you have an elemental shaman the shoulder setup is again superior due to hit cap.</div>

</div>What. No, the reason the 40 haste from Battlemaster's Alacrity is not nearly as good as Hex Head is because the Battlemaster on-use is useless from a DPS perspective. M'uru's trinket has lots of haste <b>and</b> an incredibly powerful on-use.<br>
<br>
I think it's generally accepted here that in end game gear, 1 haste rating is roughly equal to 1 damage in terms of increasing DPS. M'uru's trinket has about the same passive haste as Hex Head has passive damage, PLUS having more than 100 extra on-use damage (albeit for a shorter duration), making it an upgrade.</div>

</div>It's not a shared buff, but it is still better than HSH.<br>

And in end game setups 1 dmg ~= 0.8 haste hence why dmg gems and haste gems are a wash in terms of dps in a sunwell setup with dmg being favored for dpm.</div>

</div>I sure hope not, that would be quite frustrating <br>
<br>
But yeah theres some tidbits that tc misses on. I think the m'uru trinket is interesting, but at the same time I've found it to be somewhat frustrating to use, as is any 15s activations that aren't haste effects. Is it better to cast a fireblast at the tail-end of the 15s ? Or maybe with shifting naaru sliver + destro pot? Its already obvious that you want to refresh your scorch at the tail-end of the buff (or rather, time the activation of trinket so that it times well at the end with scorch refresh). All of this assumes of course that you can't fit an extra fireball at the end, but could fit a scorch.<br>
<br>
But then all of this is further complicated by the fact that depending on the cooldowns used this might not be a good thing. I mean, if you have IV + shifting, is it really worth it to finish off the tail end of shifting with fireblast ? Instinctively I would say that it depends on your passive haste and the number of fireballs you can cast with IV affecting the cast, which may or may not make fireblast worthwhile.<br>
<br>
I need to work out a model to properly evaluate it. I just hope it won't turn into a total mess for a really minor detail.<br>

</div>The buff 'limitless power' is not shared. However, I found an interesting 'feature' of the trinket in its current form. If you activate it, then step out of it, then come back in, you get another 15s stack. Problem is, when you run out of the circle the mechanics are kind of iffy and sometimes it stays on your for 5-10s longer and sometimes 2s. So its kind of not usable in practice, but still, maybe it can possibly be abused. Keep in mind, getting a new 15s limitless power buff will not change the fact that the power circle will die 15s after activating the trinket, which means your new limitless pwoer refresh will not last much longer. <br>
<br>
However, what I don't know, maybe your limitless power doesn't expire as soon as your power circle dies, but rather, as soon as you step out of any* power circle. Let me word it in another way:<br>
<br>
Maybe you could do the following.<br>
Activate trinket. Use for a while. Step out of circle. Let 'limitless power' run out. Run back in your circle for 'limitless power' refresh of 15s. Then get another player activate his own trinket (over you - before your circle dies out). Maybe that will allow you to keep the 15s buff ?</div>

</div>Much worse than that. It means that engineering gear to produce Rolling may or may not work at all depending on random fluctuation. I suspect the best possible scenario depends on how much the fluctuation is in deviation, and ultimately will come down to two cases: Either your latency is very stable, or at least stable enough to be able to offer Rolling with certain CDs going quite consistently. Or, your latency is all over the place, meaning you're better-off tuning as much haste as needed to provide that during the majority of your time (no CDs at all) you'll possibly roll or possibly not, depending on latency.<br>
<br>
Inconsistent, cryptical, odd and problematic. And the poster above got killed for it. Could Rolling be any more the red-headed bastard child of buggy mechanics? Thank God it's brother, Disappearing Ignites is even rarer. Except for those happy to Fireblast amongst us, that is.</div>

</div>While this is not particularly amazing, I've gone through a lot of parses lately of mages I know who read and post in this thread and have an idea about rolling ignites, and almost all mages I look at end up getting around a 44-45% ignite damage done.<br>
<br>
But there are a few anomalies out there, of a 50%+. About a month ago I had a 48% ignite damage done kill, the parse is expired now. Thinking I could get a higher rolling ignites I've re-worked my cooldowns, and I haven't gotten above 45%, even though I sustain a 2.08s cast for about 30 seconds sometimes. There are definitely problems in some areas.</div>

		<div id="post_message_766697" class="post_message_underline">I wager that Pintofbrew has hit it on the head.  What matters here in terms of achieving a consistent roll is the amount your latency chages from moment to moment.  While I may not be the most versed in theorycrafting I do know something about networking and this is not good.  What we're looking for is a consistent, stable time for each packet to go from your computer to blizzard and back.  <br>
<br>
This means one of two things.  Either all your packets take the same route every time and those routes don't slow down with other traffic or you reduce latency so the shifts don't make as large a difference.  The only reliable way of reducing latency that I can think of is connecting to a physically closer server (or one that is connected to you via higher bandwidth links), which might or might not be an option.<br>
<br>
Basically this is a ridiculous situation that is very tough to engineer.  We are essentially trying to exploit a race condition using things that we can't time accurately which is, of course, pretty darn hard.   That being said I would recommend finding a mod or making one to record your latency and take averages and then build your haste for that value.  Maybe take the readings over several days, inc weekends or whenever you usually raid., then build for that and just hope.</div>

</div>That was fixed in 2.0 with the whole ignite overhaul.<br>
<br>
Ignite cannot be resisted, does not have partial resists, and is not affected by additionial damage modifiers or vulnerabilities or reductions (like shield wall).<br>
No more Drakonids where your fireball hit for 3 times the damage and 9 times the ignite damage. Or 50k+ ticks on Thaddius.<br>
<br>
If it doesn't bug out, Ignite is exactly 40% of your crit damage. The differences come from bugged rolling/stuttering ignites.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Much worse than that. It means that engineering gear to produce Rolling may or may not work at all depending on random fluctuation. I suspect the best possible scenario depends on how much the fluctuation is in deviation, and ultimately will come down to two cases: Either your latency is very stable, or at least stable enough to be able to offer Rolling with certain CDs going quite consistently. Or, your latency is all over the place, meaning you're better-off tuning as much haste as needed to provide that during the majority of your time (no CDs at all) you'll possibly roll or possibly not, depending on latency.<br>
<br>
Inconsistent, cryptical, odd and problematic. And the poster above got killed for it. Could Rolling be any more the red-headed bastard child of buggy mechanics? Thank God it's brother, Disappearing Ignites is even rarer. Except for those happy to Fireblast amongst us, that is.</div>

</div>Hmm, I probably should have read and commented on this post last night.<br>
<br>
Basically all the inconsistencies boil down to this: The delay from your initial crit to when the ignite debuff is placed.<br>
<br>
This delay can be anywhere from .2s all the way to 1s. This is why a 2.3s cast can get a rolling ignite to happen, although it only will happen on the 2nd crit and never after. While a cast &lt; 2.1s will cause rolling ignites, it will also pushback the original ignite tick to coincide with the rest of your casts to further "force" rolling ignites to happen.<br>
<br>
I'm just waiting for someone to obtain the gear level needed to chain cast a 2.09s (what Manly says is needed) Fireball and really get a rolling ignite going, and see what kind of possible gains we get.</div>

		<div id="post_message_767674" class="post_message_underline">This goes right back to what I proposed a few months ago. We need a mod that tracks ignites. Not necessarily for TC purpose, but also for optimal play purpose. If we could single-out variables by having an aced ignite-tracking-mod and test across multiple mages, we could know for sure what tends to work best. Like, imagine a case where the mod would show you a bar for the next ignite tick is due, and what should be your casting adjustment to perform a rolling ignite.<br>
<br>
Then that mod should integrate into quartz, and extract latency data from it, even possibly showing the ignite ticks directly on quartz casting bar.<br>
<br>
Imagine something roughly<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:0px"><img src="assets/code_html.gif" border="0"></div>
	<pre class="alt2" dir="ltr" style="
		margin: 0px;
		padding: 3px;
		border: 1px inset;
		width: 694px;
		height: 162px;
		text-align: left;
		overflow: auto"><b>[****           ]</b>  (bar displays 2s)
next ignite tick: 430 ms
cast adjustment needed: +100 ms (*)
----
current ignite: 1000 / 2
----
total ignite dmg: 200 000
expected: 180 000
gain: + x %</pre>
</div>* 100ms would be determined by comparing the cast time left on current spell vs time to next ignite tick. The closer you get to 0 ms, the more you're in the optimal rolling ignite case.<br>
<br>
Then from that mod we could work out and analyse/track if scorch/fireblast is worth doing. Or fireball/fireblast.</div>

</div>So as of now, you're saying that aside from the passive haste benefit, ignore all TC done on the use? Seems kind of wrong for a trinket of that level to do that, but oh well.<br>
<br>
As a second thought to this post, has anyone seen a WWS parse of Ignites of greater than 50%?</div>

</div>100% off-topic, but: No partial resists at all in Naxx?<br>
Is it that just a parsing error, or were there really no partial resists at all?<br>
Seems odd since melee still had glancings and tanks still had crushings like expected against higher levels.<br>
<br>
<b>Dissecting the Loatheb parse</b><br>
52 fireball crits, 6047 average (8 hits, 52 crits; 24 ticks of the fireball DoT, heh). 3 scorch crits, 2276 average.<br>
Makes 314.444 + 6.828 = 321.272 crit damage.<br>
40% of that makes an expected Ignite damage of 128.509. The actual Ignite damage in the parse was 127.597.<br>
<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130512032424/http://wowwebstats.com/c3i1sm4rmrakc?s=156-311&amp;bl=267&amp;fia=21&amp;fiaa=a" target="_blank">Wow Web Stats</a><br>
Looks like at the end of the fight "Scorch the Tail!", only the ignite of a 2323 scorch crit (929 ignite) is missing.<br>
There is also 1 Fire Blast crit against a spore for 2485 with no ignite, but I didn't count Fire Blast anyway.<br>
Same for Molten Armour crits against those spores - there aren't any Ignite ticks against spores in the log, and I didn't count Molten Armour either.<br>
<br>
So, we had Ignites for 127.597, and we miss 929 from the last scorch crit. Makes 128.526 total.<br>
We expect from the logs to get 128.509. So we have a whole 17 more Ignite damage than expected.<br>
<br>
Seventeen. Wow.<br>
<br>
<b>Conclusion</b><br>
Sorry, no dice this time. The 31k tick is hot, but that's just normal behaviour really if you chain crit before Ignites can tick.<br>
<br>
<br>
Edit: The average Fireball/Scorch crits displayed are rounded by WWS. Which causes an error of at most 55 (#crits*[+-1 error margin]), and an error margin for the Ignite damage of 55*0.4 = 22.<br>
That explains our error of 17.</div>

		<div id="post_message_774044" class="post_message_underline" style="min-height: 183px;">Well, that parse is really kind of messed up. First, I got a major lagspike at the end...you can see like 10s where I did not dps at all. Also, I don't think I could get a new spore buff due to the same reason.<br>
<br>
The really interesting part would not be this. I do recall from the previous loathebs I did that it seemed like I was missing a lot of ignite ticks. Thing is, those were with just 1 lust. That parse above is almost 100% on bloodlust, which means I'm just stacking an ignite rather than rolling one (due to perma sub-2s fireballs). I was hoping the parse above could show up something, but unfortunately the perma bloodlust totally ruined it.<br>
<br>
Also, on the unrelated topic of partial resists, you do raise a solid point there. Not a single mage got a partial. I will make a quick hypothesis here that the current TC is inaccurate (based on this parse), and that level-based resistances are actually based from the <i>starting</i> mob level, rather than the one up-scaled for higher level players. IE: the boss is considered lvl 63 as far as the non-hit part of the spell check goes.</div>

</div>Indeed, there may be more to it that we're missing. But it's also one of the ONLY perks of revisiting old raid content, aside from collecting good ol' gear sets of yesteryear and some extra coin.<br>

Is it really that surprising that Blizz would forget to implement the partial resist/do it incorrectly and not care since the content is obsolete now? I'd say it's par for their course.</div>

</div> You probably had a fairly large Ignite that never ticked.  I would venture that if you look at the WWS log, you'll see that you crit 5-10 spells in a row before the Shade died.  So, you probably didn't "lose" damage.</div>

Considering a 70% crit rate with &lt;2 sec fireballs you were refreshing ignites almost constantly. You may have lost some damage from problems with ignite, but I would guess most of that damge that you can't find rolled right off the end when he died.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">That logic is flawed and has been proven wrong in the past here on this forum.<br>
<br>
The simple (non-math) explanation to it is that if you and I do the same rotation (1xSC, 8xFB), then I'll be done faster with the 5 haste extra, so I can restart the cycle faster. <br>
<br>
If you want math that goes along with this, start browsing back the threads.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Just to clarify this; if you compare no haste (9x1 28.5sec cycle) over 6 minute fight to 2% haste (9x1 27.93sec cycle) you end up getting 2 more fireballs off (very close to a third). For this same fight haste by approximately 4.8% (10x1 30sec cycle) you still have 12 rotations even, which is still 12 scorches. The fight would need to be longer than 6 minutes, approximately 12 (I didn't do this math) for the 10x1 rotation to save a scorch. Even if you used the 9x1 rotation for the 4.8% haste rotation, you cast one scorch instead of fireball, which is not much of a dps loss over a 6 minute fight, and I'd say it could be practically ignored because the death of a target could also happen before you finish a "last cast" which would alter your dps higher than this.<br>
<br>
No haste (9x1)  = 12 cycles +6 fireballs (12x28.5 + 6x3) <br>
2%    (9x1)       = 12 cycles +8 fireballs (12x27.93 +8x3)<br>
4.8% (10x1)     =  12 cycles                  (12x30)<br>
4.8% (9x1)       = 13 cycles  +2 fireballs (13x27.14 + 2x3)</div>

What's really interesting, however, is that Gonktarget (Hunter with Legendary Bow) was only 200dps under Manly even including the rolling ignites and he only had one Bloodlust to Manly's three.  Really looks to me like it's time to let ignites roll in a personal debuff stack.</div>

		<div id="post_message_778623" class="post_message_underline">Well, keep in mind that gonktarget is survival. The bow increased his brut dps by 400 basically. ~2600 dps on this week brut. By comparison I pulled a clutch 2400 dps with 2 burns, no innervates and no coe.<br>
<br>
The loatheb parse just shows how retarded 100% crit rate changes numbers (ie: permanent ferocious inspiration and a few other impacts). On the naxx parse I got 2.7k on brut I think, which was quite above gonk. <br>
<br>
The real question is what kind of of dps a bm hunter would get with that bow.<br>

Fire and frost are just spamming and arcane is ramp up then AB spam uptime maximization none of which is hurt in any way by having MSD proc.

</div>You say this as though "AB maximization" is not a feedback-controlled cycle. Often you'll want to drop your AB and a proc then will (1) cost you more mana when you want to economize (2) not be optimal, because you're not spamming your best output spell (3) induce more casts until you drop AB.<br>
<br>
It's inconvenient all-round and annoying. As arcane, there is little reason to ever use MSD, even assuming the soecket req wasn't shit and the proc wasn't bugged.</div>

<br>
I started Evocate, switched my int weapon in, finished Evocate about 6 seconds later, and swapped my weapon out. No difference that I could see. I also did this same process in combat to see if that made a difference; it did not.<br>
<br>
I did not use Outfitter and its automatic switching to achieve this, so there is more to test. Similarly, I didn't check the actual amount of mana returned by Evocate.<br>
<br>
IOW, swapping weapons does not cancel Evocate.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div><br>
I too, copied my mage to the PTR and did a test using evocation.  I wanted to see the impact of this change on my macro for evocation.  The macro I use at the moment is thus:<br>
<br>
/cast Evocation<br>
/equip Amani Divining Staff<br>
/equip Carved Witch Doctor's Stick<br>
/equip Wub's Cursed Hexblade<br>
/equip Chronicle of Dark Secrets<br>
/equip The Black Stalk<br>
<br>
As it is on the live realms, I hit my macro once and it starts to channel evocation.  While the GCD is still going on it also equips my large intellect weapons.  The staff and the badge wand are gemmed with 10 int gems and a +30 int enchant on the staff.  The game acknowledges the larger mana pool and as such I can pull off 85-95% mana back vs the 75% T6 bonus with no weapon swap gives.  While in mid channel I can hit the macro again and it won't interrupt my Evo but, will requip my DPS weapons.<br>
<br>
As it is on the PTR since I copied and re-made my macro, it still works the exact same way.  As Pintofbrew said though, channeled spells may still not be encoded into it yet.<br>
<br>
Edit: In the middle of writing this, I logged back in to do some more testing also using Polymorph and Arcane Missles.  First I retested my Evocation macro and also manually swapped weapons mid channel.  Evocation was not interrupted.  I then specced for 5/5 Improved Arcane Missles and declared war on Cenarion Circle to use the representative in Orgrimmar as a practice dummy.  Once again while casting a channeled spell, swapping my weapons did not interrupt the cast.  I then polyed the NPC.  While he was running about my feet as a sheep I started to cast another poly and swapped my weapon.  I did this 3 more times and every time I did it interrupted my cast.  So I can confirm this new mechanic is in the game on the PTR and that at this time it DOES NOT apply to channeled spells.</div>

</div>You want to maximise Intellect for Evocation, but I guess you kind of knew that.<br>
The other stats (spi/mp5) have a very minor effect, less than 1/10 of intellect.<br>
<br>
What to use? Use some database and order by intellect. Like this:<br>

Yep, I used to use that staff too. It's also handy for tanking Krosh. Though these days badge weapon + badge off hand has more stamina (&amp; I use them anyway), and the Mr. T staff has a touch more int (&amp; looks more different/interesting.. I was staring at Infinite Mysteries for /so/ long before I got a good MH weapon that I was more than happy to DE it given the chance).</div>

</div>No you are correct.  The healing staff is the best evocation weapon in the game.  Good luck if you can get one over your healers though.  If you can't get that staff, the next best staff is the one from Felmyst, <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34182" target="_blank">[Grand Magister's Staff of Torrents]</a>.

		<div id="post_message_791174" class="post_message_underline">As arcane I found swapping to int gear superfluous on Evo. Even discounting T6 bonus I found Evo would overflow my mana given SP wouldn't stop while I was channeling. Not to mention it wasn't always "safe" to Evo exactly when I wanted, which was mana=0%. More often than not I found it impossible to have less than 10% mana and get Evo timed as I felt more comfortable (ie. no aoe/silence/motion inc). Having huge regen probably made this particular point extra hard. I can see there's perhaps some marginal return in doing a partial Evo with int-gear, but then again it's not an exact science on anything except Brut or possibly terron.<br>
<br>
I suspect it'll be more valuable to fire, though again most likely in the "skimming evo for min time-wasted" context rather than "need more absolute mana". This should be particularly so given we're not supposed to swap in Evo until a number of other mana-sources have been substituted.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I hope this is in the correct thread.  I play a frost mage on my server, and I gear myself to use the extra spell hit from frostbolt. (I'm at 127 at the moment).  I have encouraged a few people in my guild to do the same, but as of this past weekend's Gruul run, they noticed that they were getting more resists than they've seen before.  I have a WWS of the run below and was looking at Azurefrosts data.<br>

<br>
He is a draenei mage with 127 spell hit (he might have been running with 114 I'm not totally sure).  But in either case, during the Gruul fight he was at a 5% miss rate.  Am I wrong with my numbers?  Or has anyone else taken a look at this post 2.4.3 patch?  I tried to search for any other "ghost hit" threads, but didn't see any.<br>

</div>Gofa gave the answer. If someone, anyone, ever has proof about frostbolt being 'fixed' they are quite welcome to post that proof. It would need to be a very large sample size, perhaps 10000 frostbolts or so. It's just that after every patch someone asks this question or similar. "Hey guys since the latest patch it seems like Onyxia is doing more deep breaths."<br>
<br>
Until someone does post some new research, you should trust the first post in this thread and not let yourself be influenced by rumour or speculation. So yeah you are 37 points of hit over capped.</div>

According to my last WWS reports (40/0/21) it <i>seems</i> "ghost frost hit rating" is still in effect.  <br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120810134639/http://wowwebstats.com/wxk5ipdizjdg1" target="_blank">Wow Web Stats</a><br>
<br>
<br>
Lurker - 74 hits, 0.9% missed  &lt;-- in range<br>
Archi + Supremus, 0.0&amp; missed  &lt;-- in range<br>
<br>
Azgalor (low sample amount), 2 hits 0.0% miss  &lt;--- in range<br>
Akama (low sample amount), 6 hits, 0.0% missed  &lt;--- in range<br>
<br>
Kaz'Rogal, 41 hits, 0 misses  &lt;--- in range<br>
<br>
Teron, can't figure out what WWS is saying.  I got constructs 2nd so I was AB spamming. The only FB I cast was ap,pom,trinket,frostbolt.  It did not count it as a "hit" but it did have a "max damage" statistic.<br>
<br>
Here are the one's that make me doubt it, hence <i>seems</i> above.....<br>
<br>
Rage - 5% miss,  &lt;--- wtf<br>
All SSC bosses, 61 hit,  2.1% miss  &lt;--- wtf<br>
<br>
All are with 40/0/21 3/5 arcane hit, 3/3 ele precision.<br>
12.6 hit rating = 1%, 1 hit rating = 1/12.6<br>
@124 hit rating<br>
So I should only need 126 hit rating<br>
soooo my % to hit should be 99-(0.079*2) = 98.842%  (Is my math wrong?)<br>
<br>
----------<br>
<br>
Ok after writing all of that and reflecting on it, we do need a bigger sample &gt;.&lt;<br>

		<div id="post_message_858992" class="post_message_underline">I've been raiding deep frost lately and except for Rage (high frost resist + binary frost spell = huge "miss" rate regardless of spellhit) I'm getting results close enough to my theoretical hit chance that I have no reason to believe ghost hit doesn't work so indeed I don't know where these rumours always come from. For a take on this and input on sample size, refer to Wizeowel's post. Your sample size is, as you noticed, far too small to be of statistical significance, when 1-2 unlucky resists can greatly skew the percentage.</div>

</div>FYI, Rage Winterchill has a high frost resistance. Hence why your miss rate on him doesn't match anything else.</div>

Ok after writing all of that and reflecting on it, we do need a bigger sample &gt;.&lt;<br>

</div>Yes, your sample size is way too low to distinguish 2.1% vs 1.2%.  This is especially<br>
true as this is a sample size over different bosses that may or may not have frost<br>
resistance mucking things up.<br>
<br>
There are statistical techniques that will tell you how big a sample you need to<br>
have a 99% confidence rating in the result and the deviation you can expect for<br>
a given sample size.  I was going to get all geeky and work it out but I'm rusty<br>
by about 2 years on it and my license for my fancy statistics tool expired so I'm<br>
afraid of giving out misinformation.<br>
<br>
So the following is conservative, based on hazy memories of trying to distinguish<br>
similar variances in quality projects:<br>
<br>
For a good test, get a tank and healer, find a L70 raid boss they can tank pretty<br>
much forever and spam frost bolt 1s.  Get a sample size of at least 500 and<br>
that's probably good enough to distinguish a 1% shift with reasonable confidence.<br>
<br>
If you're trying to distinguish tenths of percents, you'll need more like 10k.</div>

		<div id="post_message_875597" class="post_message_underline">Hi, I am currently equipped with 4T6 pieces, 1156 dps with 28.27% fire crit and 8% haste. Almost all my gemming is on spellcrit+spd. Also I must mention that my gear is not fantastic and I am missing a few (in my opinion) crucial items (like Head piece and trinket from Illidan, as well as Tempest of Chaos and offhand from MH), but I am just unlucky, so I have to play with what I have.<br>
<br>
I was "raised" with notion that crit is the most important stat (after capping hit) for a fire mage, and should start on 30% (unbuffed). When haste was introduced, I tried to balance spellcrit and haste, but prefered to get to around 30% before working on my haste.<br>
<br>
Since recently I have been hearing from mages on my serv, that I should change gemming to forego crit in favour of haste. Any advise/opinion on this?<br>
<br>
thanks</div>

Gemming for crit is about the worst thing you can do, since point-for-point, it takes far more crit rating to earn 1% crit than it does to earn 1% hit or haste. You don't want to completely ignore crit, but we get plenty of it on our gear anyway. You will get a much better return by gemming for haste or pure spell damage.</div>

		<div id="post_message_910437" class="post_message_underline">As it stands right now, is there a popular school of thought with regard to what the two best trinkets to use are?<br>
I see a LOT of mages using skull + head, but wasn't sure if that was just what they felt were the 2 best or of there was some reasoning behind it. <br>
<br>
Bringing it up here for sake of it being mentioned as an issue in the original post.<br>
<br>
From what I'm aware for 40/0/21 the 2 are SCB + Hex for the specs ability to stack all of it's CD's at once along with it being a very mana hungry spec making the SCB's benefits 2 fold.  But I'm not aware of there being such a clear cut pair for Fire.</div>

		<div id="post_message_910450" class="post_message_underline" style="min-height: 183px;">The answer is "it depends on your gear and spec" and to some extent "on your behavior"<br>
<br>
As an example, a trinket that procs on randomly works better on a spec that casts lots of fast casting spells than lots of slow spells with moderate crit rates..up to the point where its internal cooldown makes the more frequent procs irrelevant.    Stuff with +spell damage for limited time works better if you have talent-based cooldowns to stack it with...assuming you actually make use of it at the right time.   If you are low on spell hit or run out of mana, some trinkets are more attractive.  If you have trouble with on-use trinkets, using them properly, a trinket that randomly procs or just has a lot of raw spelldamage and no clicky thing might be better for you. If you die a lot because of low stamina and can't fix this with behavior, a stam trinket might be better than a DPS trinket.<br>
<br>

<br>
Will let you enter your stats and will rank trinkets in order of how much DPS they give you.  The output is fairly good if your input data is ok, but there are some assumptions about rotations and behavior that may not match yours.  It assumes a well played mage with good rotations, one of the standard raid specs and well timed cooldown use.<br>
<br>
I don't know if it has had the review of RAWR, but it seems pretty good and is where I would go first if I had no idea what might be useful for me.</div>
