		<div id="post_message_506926"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->First off, this thread is intended to be a compilation of Shadow Priest knowledge.  It has information on talent specs, gear, enchants/gems, spell priority, and a few other tidbits.  It is a co project between many of the priests on these boards, effectively.  I know both Benegesserit and Woobsauce are working on similar information, and I hope to incorporate their work into this thread.  This is mainly going to be a thread on PvE Shadow Priesting at level 70, though I could expand it to PvP if requested.<br>

<u>1. What is a Shadow Priest? (And Key Terms)</u><br>
Priests in World of Warcraft are a versatile spell casting class.  They wear cloth armor and can use one handed maces, daggers, staves, and wands.  A key part of priests is their ability to both heal and deal damage.  The three priest talent trees are Discipline, Holy, and Shadow.<br>
<br>
A shadow priest is a priest that embarks on the damage road.  Most of their talent points are located in the shadow tree, with a few in Discipline.  They deal exclusively shadow damage.  Through abilities such as Vampiric Embrace and Vampiric Touch, they return a percentage of their damage done as health and mana to their party.  Note that, again, +shadow damage and ONLY +shadow damage is a factor in deals of calculating these totals.  +damage/healing offers no benefit over raw shadow damage for PvE DPS, and +healing is worthless.<br>
<br>
Shadow priests, though capable of returning health to their party, are usually grouped with classes that can make the best use of the amazing regeneration of Vampiric Touch.  Their job is to deal as much damage as they can (without pulling aggro, of course) to return the maximum amount of health and mana to their party and to maintain two important debuffs: Shadow Weaving (+2% shadow damage from all sources to the target, stacks 5 times) and Misery (+5% spell damage to the target).<br>
<br>
Some shadow priest terms...<br>
SW:P = Shadow Word: Pain<br>
VT = Vampiric Touch<br>
VE = Vampiric Embrace<br>
MB = Mind Blast<br>
SW:D = Shadow Word: Death<br>
MF = Mind Flay<br>
GCD = Global Cooldown<br>
DoT = Damage over Time<br>
<br>
<u>What are the key talents for a Shadow Priest?</u><br>
Most of the key talents for a Shadow Priest are in the shadow tree.  I'll briefly touch over the main ones.<br>
<br>
Spirit Tap (5 ranks) = This is an amazing talent for grinding.  In raids, its use is more limited, as getting a killing blow is more difficult.  However, if you are able to snipe a kill on an add, it offers a major mana return.  You will either need to get this talent or Blackout.<br>
<br>
Blackout (5 ranks) = This is a powerful PvP talent, but not much else.  It offers a chance to stun non-immune adds in a fight, but obviously is worthless against bosses.  Neither this talent nor Spirit Tap is critical, but you will need to pick one.<br>
<br>
Shadow Affinity (3 ranks) = This is a mandatory talent.  Maxed out, it offers a 25% threat reduction to all shadow threat caused.  The current belief is that this affects VE as well, making it doubly valuable, as shadow priests are capable of producing an insane amount of threat.<br>
<br>
Improved Shadow Word: Pain (2 ranks) = This talent increases the duration of SW:P by 33%, not only improving mana efficiency but also reducing the number of GCDs needed to maintain the DoT.<br>
<br>
Shadow Focus (5 ranks) = Shadow focus is a talent that works exactly like spell hit.  Every 12.6 spell hit is equivalent of 1% spell hit.  Each point of shadow focus is worth 2% spell hit, or 25.2 spell hit rating.  This should initially be maxed out for raiding shadow priests, though shadow priests at the Black Temple/Mount Hyjal level often drop a point of two from the excess of spell hit that is unavoidable.  Against a boss, there is a 17% miss rate and 16% of that miss rate can be negated.  Shadow focus removes 10% of this, leaving 6%, or 75-76 spell hit rating needed.<br>
<br>
Mind Flay (1 rank) = This is your basic face melting spell, and an important part of your DPS between MB/SW:D cooldowns and SW:P/VT refreshes.<br>
<br>
Improved Mind Blast (5 ranks) = This talent reduces the duration of the Mind Blast cooldown in increments of 0.5 seconds.  As such, it is typically only useful as 1 point or 4 points until you have spell haste gear, as it reduces it to a 7.5 second cooldown (5 GCDs) or a 6 second cooldown (4 GCDs).  This is a staple of MB heavy casting.  With sufficient spell haste, 5 points becomes viable as it allows for a MB -&gt; MF -&gt; MF -&gt; MB, if the MF is down to a 2.75 second channel.<br>
<br>
Shadow Reach (2 ranks) = Provides a greater range on all shadow spells, allowing you to attack the boss from farther away.  This is extremely important due to MF's short range.<br>
<br>
Shadow Weaving (5 ranks) = Each point provides a 20% chance for a shadow spell to leave a debuff that increases shadow damage taken by 2% and stacks 5 times.  4 points is sufficient to maintain a full stack, and shadow priests who take 5/5 do so for PvP purposes or to insure a fast stack.  This is a major debuff for not only shadow priests but also warlocks.<br>
<br>
Focused Mind (3 ranks) = This talent increases the mana efficiency of MB, MF, and Mind Control.  The Mind Control part is not important, but the MB and MF reduction is powerful.<br>
<br>
Vampiric Embrace/Improved Vampiric Embrace (1 rank/2 ranks) = VE is a debuff placed upon a target that returns 15% of all damage dealt to that target to the shadow priest's group.  Each point in Improved VE increases that by 5% (to 20%/25% respectively).  VE is mandatory for Shadowform.  Improved VE is a matter of personal preference (and I find it quite useful).<br>
<br>
Silence (1 rank) = This spell requires two points in Improved Pyschic Scream and thus is typically not gotten in serious raiding builds.  However, it can be useful in stopping adds from casting (necromancers in Hyjal is one of the best examples).  Take it if you wish, but it will not affect your DPS in any shape or form.<br>
<br>
Darkness (5 ranks) = 10% extra damage, health, and mana returned.  Enough said.<br>
<br>
Shadowform (1 rank) = This is why shadow priests look cool.  15% extra damage and a physical damage reduction.  Get it.<br>
<br>
Shadow Power (5 ranks) = Each point increases the critical strike chance of both of your offensive and crittable spells by 3%.  As such, each point is worth 66.3 spell crit rating.  It is not a substantial damage increase overall, but it IS a damage increase.<br>
<br>
Misery (5 ranks) = 5% extra spell damage from all sources.  Mages, warlocks, elemental shamans, moonkins, etc, will love you for this debuff.  Max it out.<br>
<br>
Vampiric Touch (1 rank) = This is the reason shadow priests are raid viable.  It is a 15 second DoT that returns 5% of the damage done as mana to the group (including the priest).  This is often equivalent to 200-300 mana per 5 seconds to the shadow priest's group.  Get it.<br>
<br>
In the Discipline tree...<br>
<br>
Wand Specialization (5 ranks) = Why are you wanding?  Get this for grinding or if you don't wish to resist a fear at a bad time.<br>
<br>
Unbreakable Will (5 ranks) = Mostly a PvP talent, can both hurt and hinder PvE (resisting a fear when your tank misses the stance dance = bad, resisting a remote toy = good).  Neither this nor Wand Spec will really affect PvE.<br>
<br>
Improved Power Word: Fortitude (2 ranks) = Might as well get it.  This tier is unimpressive.<br>
<br>
Improved Power Word: Shield (3 ranks) = Might as well get it.  This tier is unimpressive.<br>
<br>
Inner Focus (1 rank) = This should be used for one of two spells during a fight: Devouring Plague or SW:P.  It's a free cast every three minutes.<br>
<br>
Meditation (3 ranks) = This talent offers 30% mana regeneration from spirit to continue while casting (in 2.3 currently 15% on live).  This will equate to something like 60 mana per 5 over not having it.<br>
<br>
The "average" raiding shadow priest spec is <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?talent=bxMhzhZZxGxkMxRhtEo" target="_blank">this</a>, or something close to it.  Spirit Tap and Blackout are interchangeable.  A point or two from Shadow Focus/Shadow Weaving/Shadow Power can be moved to Improved MB.<br>
<br>
<u>3. What are the important stats for a Shadow Priest?</u><br>
<br>
Spell hit: Point for point, 1 spell hit rating returns a larger increase in DPS than anything else.  However, this is because spell hit can become capped, and IS capped very quickly for shadow priests.  Against a boss type mob, you will have your spells resisted 17% of the time.  16% of this can be negated via spell hit.  Of that 16%, ten can be negated through talents alone, meaning 76 spell hit rating is needed.  For every 25 points of spell hit rating above this cap that <u>can not be avoided</u>, you can drop a point in shadow focus to spend elsewhere.  However, never itemise for spell hit unless you need 4-6 spell hit rating to drop another point in shadow focus and have an item that gives a +damage bonus with a yellow socket.<br>
<br>
Damage: Damage is your bread and butter stat.  It, once hit capped, is the one and only stat worth getting in the sense that every other stat is translated to damage to see it's value.  For purposes of other comparisons, one spell damage will be considered the baseline.  It does not matter whether the damage is shadow damage only or generic damage, both offer the same value and hence take whichever is higher (if all else is equal).<br>
<br>
Spell Crit: Spell crit affects every single shadow priest spell that can crit.  Yes, both of them.  Only MB and SW:D are affected by spell crit, and they only crit for 150% damage, meaning that spell crit is a fairly weak stat for shadow priests.  The current accepted conversion is roughly 6 spell crit rating = 1 damage.  Yes, it's that weak.  And it does nothing if you are not using MB or SW:D.<br>
<br>
Intellect: Intellect is only useful as it converts into spell crit.  Assuming kings, it's about 20 int per damage.  Again, a weak stat.<br>
<br>
Spirit: Spirit helps regenerate mana with Meditation (which is getting buffed in 2.3) and also adds damage via improved Divine Spirit.  9 spirit is equal to one damage, assuming kings, along with the regen benefits.<br>
<br>
Mana per 5 Seconds: This helps regenerate mana.  Good if it's on a piece, but not needed.<br>
<br>
Stamina: You only truly need a baseline hp level on Doomwalker and Naj'entus, both of whom you can wear PvP gear for.  Ultimately, don't worry about it too much.<br>
<br>
<u>4. What gems/enchants are good for a Shadow Priest?</u><br>
For gems, shadow priests have it fairly easy: +damage.  Runed &lt;blank&gt; are your friend, whether it is the 7, 9, or 12 damage variety.  It is very rare that a socket bonus is worth following (unless it requires all red gems).  Essentially, any socket is a home for your runed friends.<br>
<br>
It is important to note that the current metagem for shadow priests, the Mystical Skyfire Diamond, requires more blue gems than yellow gems. Thankfully, shadow priests generally don't use any yellow gems, meaning that swapping one runed gem for a glowing gem will activate the meta.<br>
<br>
For enchants, I'll break it down slot by slot...<br>
<br>
Head = <a class="q2" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29191" target="_blank">[Glyph of Power]</a><br>

<br>
<u>5. What sort of gear does a Shadow Priest wear?</u><br>
Once a shadow priest has sufficient spell hit, damage is the key stat. Spell crit provides some use, but not nearly as much as damage.  I believe current calculations have 6 spell crit rating equaling 1 damage under the heaviest MB/SW:D casting.  Essentially, shadow priests want damage first, and mana per 5 second.  Spirit is useful for extra damage (through Improved Divine Spirit) but should not be sought out.<br>
<br>
Here is a list of pre-raid gear that is attainable without stepping into Karazhan.  The PvP based items take longer than the others to obtain, but offer a large stamina boost at the cost of very little damage (only a 1 damage loss on the bracers for a 370 health, for example).  Credit to Wootsauce for most of the new items.<br>

<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080405144535/http://shadowpriest.com/viewtopic.php?t=6594" target="_blank">shadowpriest.com: Best Raiding Gear Available </a> has a ranking of the raid gear, although I cannot completely vouch for it's accuracy.  That entire site has a good deal of information, if you can deal with struggling through some of the posts.<br>
<br>
<u>6. What is some basic information on Shadow Priest spells?</u><br>
Shadow Priests are fairly interesting in that most of their scaling comes from talents, which vastly amplify the coefficients of spells.  Shadow priests have three types of scaling.  The first is DoT scaling, which applies to SW:P and VT.  A DoT coefficient is usually based upon five ticks = 100%, though I'll explain exactly how the main two Shadow Priest DoTs scale.  The second is direct damage scaling, which applies to MB and SW:D.  The third is the scaling of MF, which is a tad odd and will be addressed fully.<br>
<br>
<u>7. What is a spell priority system, and how does it apply to Shadow Priests?</u><br>
ZOMG I JUST NEED TO KNOW WHAT ROTATION TO USE.<br>
<br>
Sorry, it doesn't quite work like that.  Shadow priests may have specific combinations they like to cast (such as MB -&gt; MF -&gt; MF -&gt; MB) but they are part of a general priority system.  This priority system is a way to determine what spell to cast next.  It is a method to juggle essentially four cooldowns (MB, SW:D, VT, SW:P).<br>
<br>
The spell priority that is generally accepted is...<br>
<br>
1. VT<br>
2. SW:P<br>
3. MB<br>
4. SW:D<br>
5. MF<br>
<br>
This means you always maintain VT, and then always maintain SW:P.  If both of these are ticking, use MB if it's up, and then SW:D.  Only MF if all four other spells are on cooldowns.<br>
<br>
NOTE: This is a maximum DPS priority list.  At lower gear levels, it is common to simply use...<br>
<br>
1. VT<br>
2. SW:P<br>
3. MF<br>
<br>
<u>8. FAQ</u><br>
Q: How much minimum mana do I need?<br>
A: You need enough damage to last between mana potions and shadowfiends.  Beyond that, you do not NEED a set amount of mana.  A shadow priest's mana pool scales with his damage, not intellect.<br>
<br>
Q: How much minimum health do I need?<br>
A: 6800 for Doomwalker and 8500 for Naj'entus.  Both of these values are raid buffed.  In both cases, a Power Word: Shield can cut off some of the incoming damage.  Outside of those fights, maximum health will rarely be an issue.<br>
<br>
Q: How does Shadowfiend work?<br>
A: The shadow fiend is summoned at your target and generally attacks 10 times.  For each point of damage that is does, you gain 2.5 times that in mana.  The damage done is increased by your own spell damage (65% over the duration, or 6.5% per hit) and also by debuffs on the target (Shadow Weaving, Misery, Curse of Shadows, etc.)  It has a high resist and avoidance rate.<br>
<br>
Q: What kind of group should I be in?<br>
A: It depends on your raid.  Shadow priests are generally clumped with mages and other casters and then with healers on some fights.  You'll want to have a shaman for Wrath of Air and Mana Spring in your group (Resto offers Mana Tide and Elemental offers Totem of Wrath as well).<br>
<br>
If there are any other questions that should be answered, list them and I'll do my best.  If anyone has good information to offer on haste rating, I'd love to hear it.  My guild is 5/5 Hyjal and 5/9 BT with absolutely no spell haste item drops, thus I have been unable to test anything.<br>
<br>
And, of course, if I've messed something up, please yell at me and I'll fix it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_507855"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I would assume spell haste would be pathetic for shadow priests as it only practically affects mind flay which is your lowest priority spell and not a big enough portion of your DPS. <br>
(Just like crit only affects MB and SW which again by themselves aren't a big enough portion of your DPS not to mention they only crit for 1.5X while itemz value crit rating as if crits are 2X and even for classes that can crit all spells for 2x 1 spell damage is generally &gt; 1 crit rating.)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_508026"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Spell haste isn't quite as bad as you might think.<br>
<br>
In an ideal 30 second cycle a shadow priest should cast 2*VT, 1.25*SWP, 2.5*SWD, 5.4*MB (assuming 5.5 imp MB).  That lot adds up to 16.7 seconds leaving 13.3 seconds for other stuff.<br>
<br>
Now in the real world there is lag so you won't be casting all those spells quite that quickly, however in the real world the cooldowns don't overlap very neatly so you won't actually fit that many of those spells into a 30 second window.<br>
<br>
In practive I typically find that I'm spending about 40% of my time casting mind flay, so 40% of my cast time is gaining a benefit from spell haste.<br>
<br>
Running the numbers through the various simulators available and at 1200 damage you get something like 3 spell haste = 1 damage, which is big enough that it can't be ignored.<br>
<br>
<br>
Since you mentioned crit, the same simulations show that 6 crit is worth about 1 damage (assuming using SWD - a bit lower without).  Again not awesome but big enough that it can't be ignored completely.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_508227"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The jury is still out on spell haste.  There has been some rudimentary mathematical modeling that has placed it anywhere between 2 haste = 1 damage and .8 haste = 1 damage.  I haven't seen a formula I'm comfortable with (and I've been one of the people posting formulas too).<br>
<br>
That said, there has been a reasonable amount of anecdotal evidence that priests geared in T6 level gear that stack spell haste are gaining modest returns on their DPS.  There have been a few posted WWS pages on the issue, and haste does seem to make a difference.  The value of haste is clearly in the same ballpark as damage; it's just not clear what the actual trade off is, even when the spell damage value is fixed.<br>
<br>
On that note, it's worth mentioning that spell damage increases your DPS and DPM by a static amount no matter what you've stacked.  And haste increases you DPS by a larger amount once you have more spell damage, but never increases your DPM.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

For the pre-raid gear list I'd suggest adding the <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=27922" target="_blank">[Mark of Defiance]</a> trinket, it's finally been fixed to proc off dots and is much easier to get than the other two. <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=24079" target="_blank">[Khorium Band of Shadows]</a> is also very good for how easy it is to get.<br>
<br>
On spell priorities, how about suggesting the use of mods that show dot duration like ClassTimers (can't remember the others).<br>
<br>
For the FAQ section, maybe add something along the lines of "Why is spell crit bad?" with the numbers from earlier in the post, so it's easier to find. And maybe "Will I need lots of mana potions?" .<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Like I said - it doesn't fall off when you prioritize it that way.  <br>
<br>
So at least if you look at it from the standpoint of omgvtunderallcircumstances<br>
<br>
VT<br>
swd<br>
mb<br>
swp<br>
mf<br>
<br>
<br>
Anyone I've seen prioritizing swp over the previous two, do lower dps then the other way.  I understand your VT argument, I'm just saying I guess - that I never see it fall off when I prioritize it that way - so I don't need to prioritize it highest even though I sorta do...but yeah, SW:P &lt; using the other cd's for sure.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Well, let's look at some numbers.  First, we'll keep VT out of the equation for the reasons stated.  So, we're comparing MB, SW:D, and SW:P.  These spells have effective cooldowns of 7-9.5, 12, and 24 second cooldowns, respectively.  We'll look at each seperately and I'll use <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080405144535/http://wowwebstats.com/kpssdh1qk1udq?s=6203-6591&amp;a=11" target="_blank">Balkoth - WWS</a> for the numbers on MB and SW:P.<br>
<br>
According to that kill, MB's average damage was 2200.  SW:P was ticking for 750.  The key is finding out how much damage you lose by losing a GCD.  SW:P ticks every 3 seconds for 750, or 375 per GCD.  Mind Blast (using 5/5 Imp MB) can hit for 2200 every 7 seconds, or losing 315 per GCD when it's not used.  With no points in Imp MB it is 232.  Now, granted, I do not have Shadow Power or much crit.  But unless the Mind Blast does 375/314= 19% more damage all of a sudden, using SW:P is superior.<br>
<br>
So, now let's compare MB to SW:D.  Fact 1: MB hits for more than SW:D.  Fact 2: SW:D has a longer cooldown than MB.  Using the GCD loss argument, MB is clearly superior.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Can't say this for a certainty at the moment. Have you considered the value of spirit with the common meditation build? 30% in 2.3 could very well sway in favor of spirit over mp/5, especially when considering the fact that it also has the potential to increase your spell damage.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>I believe, raid buffed, Meditation currently offers about 10 mana/5 per point.  So in 2.3 priests will likely gain 30 mana/5 if they have full Meditation, from their spirit.  Now, I haven't done any hard math, but based upon gem stat ratios 10 spirit would have to be superior to 4 mana per 5, in terms of regeneration and extra damage.  I don't have time to try to figure it out now.<br>
<br>
And yes, we still don't have any hard data that is consistent for haste (besides haste being more valuable at higher damage levels).<br>

</div>While it's true that the MB and SW:P cooldowns aren't head-to-head often, SW:P will always do more DPS per global, if it runs the full duration (bosses).<br>
<br>
Without 2pc T6, SW:P will tick 8 times. If we take an average tick of 600 (yes, this is quite low to send home the message), we can expect 8 * 600 for 4800 damage over a 1.5 second global (3200 DPS). Again, this is close to the lowest end of SW:P's DPS capability. I can personally expect closer to 8100 damage done (5400 DPS)<br>
<br>
Without even going into the math, with 4pc T6 and Imp. SB proc, I'm looking at mid-4800 crits from MB. That is, if the stars are all aligned, MB will _match_ the lowest expectations from SW:P. Averaged over a fight, the MB GCD falls behind.<br>
<br>
======<br>
<br>
As for haste, more than mind flay will take advantage of the stat. Effectively, hasted MB and VT will invoke the cooldown or sooner dot ticks. This will haste the rate at which MB and VT can be recast, increasing long-term DPS.<br>
<br>
There is also speculation / anecdotal theories claiming haste is affecting server response on instant casts. If this is the case, haste will also counter any latency tacked onto an instant's GCD, which can't be combated by /stopcasting.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I would argue that you want the following priority list to maximize dps.<br>
<br>
1. SW<br>
2. MB<br>
3. VT<br>
4. SW:P<br>
5. MF<br>
<br>
Outside of the initial SW:D or mb (depending if it's safe at the fight to SW:D), with 5/5 mb, using mb/SW:D every moment they are up - I rarely see either hit when vt is down.  I do see them hit with SW:P down a tick, but you'll maximize your dps (maybe lose a slight bit of mana, but I never really go oom if I'm using pot cd's every time I'm below 2k mana and they're up).<br>
<br>
Like I said - that's just me, and is from experience - but anything with  a cd like SW:D/mb, you want to use first and keep using to maximize their usage.  <br>
<br>
Even after using a skull of gul'dan, they're worth using (and eating the bit of gcd you get) due to their supremely higher dps.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Personally, I cast VT -&gt; SW:P before my DD spells for two reasons. Threat management (spikes early are bad, mkay?) and VT/SW:P apply two stacks of Shadow Weaving and apply Misery, allowing 9% more damage on the MB and 11% on the SW. If the fight requires a bit more time of threat generation, I'll generally spam rank 1 SW:Ps first off to build 3-4 stacks of shadow weaving and get misery on there, then I'll go into VT -&gt; SW:P to cap it off at 5 (I only have 4/5 Shadow Weaving, just to note) making my DD spells at this point do 15% more damage. I use the DD spells immediately after the DoTs, though, to free up the cooldowns early and often.<br>

		<div id="post_message_508995"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I have a question concerning the +hit cap on a Draenei Shadow Priest.  The "Working Theories of Theorycrafting as of 2.2" thread reports that, "Once you reach the hit cap, +damage is the best stat to stack for a shadow priest."<br>
<br>
As I understand it, for PvE, +16% chance to hit is the maximum effective. A Draenei gets a +1% chance to hit racial bonus, so a Draenei SP needs on +15% chance to hit to reach the hit cap, which translates to a 15*12.6 = +190 spell hit rating.<br>
<br>
But as a SP, having 5 points in Shadow Focus give another +10% chance to hit for shadow spells, so this should mean that only another +5% chance to hit is needed for a Draenei SP to reach the hit cap for shadow spells, which is only 5*12.6 = +63 spell hit rating.<br>
<br>
But though +63 spell hit rating points allows the Draenei SP to be maxed on shadow spells, it takes another +127 spell hit rating points on top of that to max chance to hit for one of the most commonly used SP spells, Mind Blast.<br>
<br>
My question is, after getting to +63 spell hit rating on a Draenei SP, is there any reason to invest another rating point in spell hit rating to get better performance on Mind Blast, or should further itemization be directed at +damage?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_509217"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->There are three reasons you'd want any spell caster (except maybe a warlock) with a shadow priest over a hunter:<br>
<br>
<b>#1) Totem Contention</b><br>
<br>
The shaman and priest want Wrath of Air, as does everyone else in the group except the hunter, who wants agility.  You waste useful totem buffs when you mix a shaman, shadow priest, and hunter.  And the Shaman / Priest synergy is far too strong to be ignored.<br>
<br>
<b>#2) Hunters are more effective when out of mana than casters</b><br>
<br>
When a hunter runs out of mana, he uses autoshot and his pet, and his DPS is maybe cut in half.  When any caster runs out of mana, they don't lose 50% damage.  They lose 95% damage, since all they can do is wand.  Warlocks are the exception because they can lifetap.<br>
<br>
<b>#3) Hunters don't need as much mana</b><br>
<br>
The mana regen from judgement of wisdom is enough to operate at close to full capacity on most fights, such that the marginal benefit of a priest is low.  This is because hunters average close to 1 hit per second half of which didn't require mana to fire, where most casters land 1 hit every 2 to 3 seconds.  (Arcane missile mages is the exception here, but missiles is a mana pig, so the mage still needs a priest).<br>
<br>
That's why hunters benefit less from shadow priests than other classes.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Anyone I've seen prioritizing swp over the previous two, do lower dps then the other way.

</div>As mentioned before SW:Pain is always going to be a priority as long as the dot goes through a full cycle.  I wouldn't ever recommend this rotation.  The only time you are going to prioritize burst spells over DoT refreshment priority is in the last 3-4% of a raid boss's life.  beyond that, the cycle with SW:Death is actually lower dps early on.  Also, supremely stupid for the initial burst damage.  I would argue the normal DoT rotation a suggested by Balkoth is probably the best, as it doesn't lend itself to the high tps to start off an encounter. Not that I don't think people can watch omen, but I'm pretty cynical and expect someone to screw it up.  For those of you who have the Darkmoon Card: Crusade, opening with a few rank1's isn't such a bad idea.  You dump a few thousand threat, and will gain a modest boost on your damage.  The final reason that rotation is horrid, is that in most BT fights, the splash damage going around generally doesn't give you the luxury to buttonmash death every time the cooldown is up.  Fights like Gurtogg, Teron, Naj'entus, etc., all have massive amounts of spike damage which can cut your life short.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I'm generally sitting at ~1200-1300 effective dps (this means ignoring movement, silences and just general downtime in dps) and I've only got one (!) item from above Kara, which is a crafted that I could've gotten even without being beyond Kara.<br>
<br>
But to the question asked, where Spriests should be on dps:<br>
<br>
Spriests mana effeciency comes from spell/Shadow damage. THe dps increase is highest from decent to semi-high damage.<br>
<br>
This is just an estimate, but it should give you an idea on how it works:<br>
<br>
0-950 dmg<br>
slow increase in dps<br>
<br>
950-1200<br>
Enormous increase in DPS due to being able to add in MBs/Sw: Deaths<br>

		<div id="post_message_511416"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'd argue that an equal factor in your DPS is how good your tank is at in producing threat.  This is probably more important for spriests more than any other class since SWD is a fairly high threat spell, considering that you're going to double dip in threat as VE heals the damage you take from it back up.  <br>
<br>
As for casting priority, I always go:<br>
<br>
VT<br>
VE<br>
SWP<br>
MB<br>
SWD<br>
MF<br>
<br>
i.e if VT isn't up, then my first priority is getting it up.  My primary role in a raid is actually not to do DPS, it's mana regen via VT, and in more than just a few fights in T6 content, healing via VE.  Having those 2 effects up is paramount.  Of course, doing DPS is right behind that, but the mindset that VT+VE is the only reason you come to raids is a great way to force yourself to focus on making sure your uptime on those is as great as possible. <br>
<br>
Any fight you need to do some small movement?  Do it when you need to cast a SWP, or SWD or VE, since you can cast those on the run, and have a 1.5 sec global cooldown before you can cast something else anyways.<br>
<br>
Something else to add would be considering DoT uptime.  If you use WWS, this is easy to determine if you go to your character's page and see the time you were present for.  Lets say for a Void Reaver kill, you were present from 18:52:06 to 18:58:32.  That's 6 minutes, 26 seconds, or 386 seconds.  Lets say you had 105 ticks of VT.  VT ticks every 3 seconds, so 105*3=315 seconds of VT uptime.  315/386 = 82% uptime with VT.   Note:  You will never hit 100% uptime with dots, there's many factors involved to how your uptime goes.  It may be a movement fight, in which you'll find out your SWP uptime will be better than VT, since you have to stop and cast VT and it may come at a time when you can't afford to stop.  You can't exactly stop and cast VT if an orb is coming right at you.  The start of the fight is usually when the MT engages, and dots aren't up right then as well, and for the last 1% you may not reapply dots.  Finally there's going to be a bit of a gap inbetween your old dot and your new dot, since you defintely do not want to overwrite any of your dots until that last tick has occured.  Remember that when you apply a dot, the first tick doesn't occur until 3 seconds in, and the last tick occurs as it expires.  To illustrate the concept of clipping your dots and why this is really bad, consider how you should approach VT:<br>
<br>
0 sec:  You start casting VT<br>
1.5 sec:  VT lands on the mob<br>
4.5 sec:  Tick 1<br>
7.5 sec:  Tick 2<br>
10.5 sec:  Tick 3<br>
13.5 sec:  Tick 4<br>
15.1 sec: You start casting VT<br>
16.5 sec: Tick 5, VT falls off the mob<br>
16.6 sec:  VT lands on the mob<br>
<br>
Now if you had started casting VT at 14.9 sec, it would have landed at 16.4 sec, costing you the final tick of your previous VT and cutting your DPS from that spell down by 20%.  In short, have a dot timer, know when your dots are going to expire, and make sure they're reapplied right after they fall off so you don't clip that last tick.   As for what your dot uptime should be for any particular fight, that's really hard to say.  In general, anything under 80% means you definitely have room for improvement, big movement fights (Void Reaver at times) notwithstanding.  SWP uptime should be higher since it can be cast on the run, and there's less casts of it needed due to the longer length.  <b>The #1 thing for an aspiring shadow priest to work on is dot uptime.  So is the #2 thing and the #3 thing!</b> So I'd make this a big priority in the guide.  A dot timer is mandatory, and examining your uptime via WWS or other tools is almost as mandatory.  If there's another shadow priest in your raid, definitely compare your uptime with theirs.  See how much mana you returned via VT compared to what they returned.  Healthy competition is a good thing!  Comparing my uptime to other shadowpriests and grinding my teeth when mine wasn't quite as good on a particular week was how I got better and better each week.  Any retard can mash the MB or SWD key when it comes off cooldown, or mindlessly spam flay, but to actually track your dots and efficiently reapply them is what separates the middling shadowpriests from the good ones.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Another way that I like to calculate VT uptime using WWS is to take the total mana returned via VT (only works if you are the only shadow priest in the group though) and divide that by your Shadow damage done multiplied by 0.05.  This figure is how much VT was up during the time you were actually DPSing the mob which can be helpful for fights with phases where you are unable to DPS the mob.  <br>

</div>I'm pretty sure it's just 3% and it's uptime is close to 80% anyway.  At 1200 DPS, the buff give you an extra 36 DPS.  Multiplying by 20/9, you get an equivalence of 80 spell damage, so Wrath of Air is still better.  It's better to be with a shaman than a hunter.<br>
<br>
For the record, I haven't had much issue getting range on Wrath of Air on most fights.  Our positions are chosen with position to the shaman in mind.  The only fight where it's an issue is Archimonde.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I don't think it will take that long, especially given the extra spell haste items in Zul'Aman.  I know this is just anecdotal evidence, but I have the most spell haste of any caster in my guild and I'm almost always the #1 or #2 caster on damage meters.  It's very rare that I'm beaten on a single target fight by a mage, even though they are all arcane with Mystical Skyfire Diamond and at least 2 pieces of T6.  Looking at parses from other guilds, I know the mages should be beating me and I know they aren't messing up the repeated spamming of the same key.  The deciding factor has to be the extra 150 spell haste I have.  As far as the actual value of spell haste relative to damage, we don't know.  But it is not a meaningless stat like crit or int.<br>

A: 6800 for Doomwalker and 8500 for Naj'entus.  Both of these values are raid buffed.  In both cases, a Power Word: Shield can cut off some of the incoming damage.  Outside of those fights, maximum health will rarely be an issue.</div>

		<div id="post_message_512213"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Issues where shaman totems aren't always in range:<br>
<br>
Many types of trash pulls where you are moving around a lot to follow tanks chasing sheep.<br>
Lurker, Gruul, Mag, Kael, Fathomlord, Vashj, A'lar...I'm not even going to keep going through more encounters in my head because anything &gt; 0 is a problem vs a hunter who doesn't have to worry about range.<br>
<br>
Sure, a lot of these issues can be fixed by re-applications of totems, but I don't want to rely on their performance during battle to keep me buffed. Any BM hunter can slap his **** on the keyboard and proc FI*. Mana totem might mean something to me if I was going oom at some point. Plus, the fact that hunters can sustain something that resembles DPS does not have anything to do with the monster jump they hit when I provide them with the extra mana.<br>
<br>
Sure, if you have two arc mages and 2 elem shaman, give them a spriest. But definitely give your hunters a spriest. If it weren't for vashj bats I'd see 2 BM hunters in my group consistently.<br>
<br>
Getting two shaman in a caster group is nearly impossible in a 25-man. Melee pretty much always demand one, and/or the tank group. There never seems to be a problem with moving hunters around. 2 hunters with BM &gt; 1 WoA (and a mana totem I don't need).<br>
<br>
I've done more damage in practice rolling with hunters than I have with shaman, but I guess results may vary.<br>
<br>

<br>
With other DPS "competing" (though not really) for a killing blow, you can't guarentee the proc like you can grinding (and yet only a decent chance in 5-mans). Blackouts pretty much only serve to help the entire raid by giving everyone a chance to go at it w/o the mob getting involved.<br>
<br>
Anyone on a PvP server will also consider it simply because it can help save their butt outside, while Spirit Tap means nothing because when it goes off your opponent is already dead.<br>

Spriests mp/5 will continue to go up with +dmg, to the point where going OOM happens less and less. Especially with crafted gear, it doesn't take long where the only thing between going OOM and not is simply choosing to save some money on pots.<br>

		<div id="post_message_512664"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I would disagree -- not that spirit tap is impossible in raids, but rather blackout is superior.<br>
<br>
First off, spirit tap is not a guaranteed thing, which kills it in my eyes.  While each fight might have adds, half of those fights I will be dpsing down the main boss, simply because the cost of dotting adds (that die regardless in a few seconds) outweighs the supposed gains of a spirit tap.  Of the times that I *do* dps down adds, I still rather have blackout.<br>
<br>
The reason is, Blackout is damage prevention.  It works great during vashj when i'm on strider duty, on Al'ar's phase 2 birds, or even Solarian's priest summons.  It is an invaluable source of saving lives, and surviving in things fights is often the challenge.  Less damage your raid takes, the less overall mana your healers use.  SSC to black temple, blackout is my choice.<br>
<br>
If I need mana, I pop mana potions.  There is no popping a blackout if you don't have the talent.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

The question I was implying was what boss fight does it help on?  Aside from Vashj strider kiting, I don't see a valid reason for one over the other.  Further, the context of the previous post was Kael'thas onward, which kind of discounts the strider kiting reason.<br>

</div>Here's the primary difference.  Blackout procs on doing damage while Spirit Tap procs on kills.  It's a lot easier to guarantee you'll do damage than guarantee a killing blow.  It's value in the Hyjal trash is far superior to Spirit Tap, since you'll average three to four random stuns per minutes for 20 minutes of trash.  And the trash should be considered part of the boss fight.<br>
<br>
And there's only one single fight in Black Temple where you have a chance of Spirit Tap proccing-- Shade of Akama, and that's not a difficult fight.  At least blackout can stun one of the bosses in Illidari Council.<br>

				 I don't think it will take that long, especially given the extra spell haste items in Zul'Aman. I know this is just anecdotal evidence, but I have the most spell haste of any caster in my guild and I'm almost always the #1 or #2 caster on damage meters. It's very rare that I'm beaten on a single target fight by a mage, even though they are all arcane with Mystical Skyfire Diamond and at least 2 pieces of T6. Looking at parses from other guilds, I know the mages should be beating me and I know they aren't messing up the repeated spamming of the same key. The deciding factor has to be the extra 150 spell haste I have. As far as the actual value of spell haste relative to damage, we don't know. But it is not a meaningless stat like crit or int.

</div>Tedv, I seem to recall our chat.  150 spell haste is not what is making or breaking your dps.  People such as Bilian and myself are matching/beating your damage without 150 haste (and no msd for myself in particular), Bilian with FAR less than yourself.  This quote is a poor example of "evidence" because you fail to face the idea that your mages might not be doing their job.  Not that its not possible for us to be near the top to start bt/hyjal progression, but when good mages start hitting 1500-1800 dps, even we cannot compete at that level.  Its pretty rare for us to even get near 1400 dps.  Its not that I don't see us occasionally beating mages (we've all probably done it), its just that at the endgame, I don't think we should be.  As the game goes farther and farther on, I think that we need to realize our strength as a utility class, rather than a pure dps class (not saying we shouldn't be pushing dps, we always should be).<br>
<br>
Also, its not that I fail to see the benefit of spell haste, but right now I'm building two sets of gear and I don't think at this point in time, that the appropriate gear exists in game at the time to really make spell haste shine for shadow priests.  The main difference between most spriest rotations is that you can build around a buttonmash build which you live and die by the mind blast and death cooldowns, or you can go the mindflay priority rotation and hope msd procs, but with the incoming patch, this type of build is going to be severely retarded and really rather weak, no matter how efficient it might be.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

As mentioned above Blackout and Spirit Tap are equally useful in raid enviroments, a little favored towards Blackout as it doesn't depends on the killing blow. <br>
<br>
The chances are pretty low, that one of these talents are going to play a role in a bossfight. If you prefer melting faces in battlegrounds between the raids, try Blackout. If you prefer to farm or doing heroics consider Spirit Tap.<br>

</div>To be fair, arcane mages should average 1400 to 1600.  The 1800 numbers are just when you win the focus proc lottery.  And I agree that we shouldn't hit those ranges.  When a mage gets better gear, the mage deals more damage.  When a shadow priest gets more gear, the priest AND the mage deal more damage.  So long term mages should always beat us.<br>
<br>
I suppose it is possible the mages are making mistakes, but if I can handle two DoTs, two damage cooldown spells, and one spammable spell, I'm pretty sure they can handle casting Arcane Missiles over and over again.  I just don't see how they could mess that up.<br>
<br>
I had a conversation with Manly a while back and he proposed this theory that one of the primary differentiators of your DPS in end game raiding is your proactive positioning.  You lose DPS time when you have to move around, so if you plan your moves, you stop wasting 2 or 3 seconds of damage here and there that add up to real time lost throughout the entire fight.  I wonder if the issue is positioning.  But for the record, spell haste helps that too.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_513662"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'd make an arguement that Spirit Tap is useful for Vashj, but would agree (from the sounds of things, as I'm working on Kael at the moment!) that Blackout overtakes it beyond.<br>
<br>
It's pretty easy to quickly switch targets in Phase 2 of Vashj and SWD a killing blow on an Enchanted Elemental coming over the stairs.  Keeping this up throughout Phase 2 (and with keeping Mana Potions on cooldown / Shadowfiend on the Naga) can mean you can get into Phase 3 with 80%+ mana to throw at Vashj.  If the Shadowfiend was timed well in Phase 2, it's likely it'll be back up at around 20% in Phase 3, making the fight a LOT easier on the shadowpriests (and hence the parties) mana bars.<br>
<br>
Having said that - I'm 1 of 3 Shadowpriests on the Strider at Vashj, and the other 2 do run with Blackout.  And I certainly wouldn't want to miss those procs.  It's possible it comes down to how many you take to Vashj, and what your raid makeup is - Striders with Slow / Curse of Exhaustion / Frost Shock / Mind Flay and Hammer of Justice / Tailoring Nets being used on them don't really need blackout procs, it's just a nice bonus.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">To be fair, arcane mages should average 1400 to 1600.  The 1800 numbers are just when you win the focus proc lottery.  And I agree that we shouldn't hit those ranges.  When a mage gets better gear, the mage deals more damage.  When a shadow priest gets more gear, the priest AND the mage deal more damage.  So long term mages should always beat us.<br>
<br>
I suppose it is possible the mages are making mistakes, but if I can handle two DoTs, two damage cooldown spells, and one spammable spell, I'm pretty sure they can handle casting Arcane Missiles over and over again.  I just don't see how they could mess that up.<br>
<br>
I had a conversation with Manly a while back and he proposed this theory that one of the primary differentiators of your DPS in end game raiding is your proactive positioning.  You lose DPS time when you have to move around, so if you plan your moves, you stop wasting 2 or 3 seconds of damage here and there that add up to real time lost throughout the entire fight.  I wonder if the issue is positioning.  But for the record, spell haste helps that too.</div>

</div>Well, tedv, at our gear curve (the both of us here) we should be tipping the scales at 1200 dps or so, and our arcane mages should be tipping 1400 dps.  And most of my ideas on mage theorycraft generally spawn from manly or seath, and hitting 1600 dps seems more than feasible if you have the exalted bt trinket, and the msd, though post patch I'm not certain how well it will function in the future.  And for the record, that issue with positioning makes you just that much better than the other players around you.  If you are always going to be that much more proactive, and can do just that much more dps, than that goes to show that you are a smarter/efficient player.  Until they can handle that much, you will continue to leave them in the dust (as for spell haste helping, thats complete bullshit, sorry your extra .15 seconds in a 5 second positioning move are pretty rare, and the extra 3 seconds of dps -shouldn't- be breaking your dps [e.g. shahraz.  Lets say you need to reposition 30 times that fight, an extra 4.5 seconds of dps, will only add up to another 4.5k dmg, and that is far too inconsequential to compare to your ability to move, cutting half-seconds or even full seconds of movement.]).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yeah they are.  I've routinely had stuff go immune tanking heroics with Imp Revenge.  My problem with Blackout for PvP is that it's just not reliable enough to bother.  It doesn't go off when you need it to go off, and it proccing can actually mess up your rhythm.  When I farm, I pull with a VT, turn around and start running, SW: P and VE (if necessary) on the run, then turn around and flay and then I get a mind blast off before the mob gets to me.  With a blackout proc, the mob is still OOR of the flay when I turn around, which means I have to either wait for it, or cast MB.  I'm annoyed by either outcome.<br>

</div>I think it might be time for you to "get serious."  I realize that this is a high end BT/Hyjal raid board, but assuming that everyone in said guilds are high end players that care about min/maxing their specs and casting rotations is a bit of an overstatement, don't you think?  Do you really thing all the mages and rogues respec for pvp and then have an optimal PvE spec?  Really?  All the guilds that just got into SSC have people that have opimal specs and never would consider taking any talent that doesn't increase their personal DPS in a raid environment?  Come on.<br>
<br>
I raided MC/BWL the summer before TBC came out with a guild of some pretty decent people.  But that's all they were...decent people.  When it came to playing, they were horrible.  We had epic battles of mathmatics on the guild board regarding Windfury, because that guild never used it.  You can't argue with people who don't want to listen, and it's even harder to get someone who's been playing their character the same way for 2 or 3 years to change their patterns.  Some of them do it once they see numbers, but there is a large segment of the population that plays on "Feel."  "Well, the tank doges more with GOA, so we're gonna use that."  I know you people hear that stuff every day.<br>
<br>
So from a complete min/max standpoint is there a time and a place for each talent?  Sure.  I won't argue that.  But in reality there are going to be other variables in your raid to take into account, and I highly doubt that they all care as much about min/maxing their stats as much as the people who read this board do.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Well guess what? Perhaps neither of those talents were intended to be a big player in boss fights. Saying who cares on trash is your problem, and does not discount the value of the talents and how they perform on trash. If you don't care about trash, then go in 0/0/0, and naked. Because you don't care. Performance is performance. Anything you can do to make trash faster and smoother is always a big help. I'm tired of people acting like they should not give two squirts of piss about trash. It's primarily the reason in a raid instance that is being farmed that guilds die more often on trash than they do on the bosses. You're dilusional if you think BT farming guilds never ever die on trash.<br>
<br>
Since neither talent are that much of a help on bosses (barring some very situational encounters), then you look elsewhere, and from a PvE raiding standpoint, your only other option is trash. You can stop caring when Blizzard gives people the option to despawn trash after having enough faction reputation*.<br>

</div>Spirit tap becomes less and less useful the more powerful a priest gets (via +dmg) since they are gaining more and more mana per cast and the cost of the spells aren't going up. Any spriest with kara and crafted gear can do vashj w/o going oom if they spend the cash on consumables. You can't rely on an elemental getting lose that's low on life to regen your mana. Going out of your way to proc spirit tap on a mob that didn't need your help is wasted dps time that should have been on mobs that do.<br>

</div>Okay, lemme explain it again before everyone naysayed on what I said.<br>
<br>
Lets assume you pick Blackout for the purpose of stunning trash and helping your raid out.  What if your warrior has improved revenge?  He's hitting that button every cooldown.  There's a solid chance that he's proccing a good amount of stuns on that mob, therefore rendering it immune to your blackout.  What if you have a fire mage who enjoys doing the 3 minute thing in PvP and has impact?  His stuns are causing DR's on yours.  What if your blackout procs during a HoJ or Kidney shot?  Are you truly getting the most bang for your buck out of that talent point?<br>
<br>
Even if none of the raid has any stun talents, if the trash is stunnable, I would assume that your other classes would be using their class specific stuns on said trash...is that an incorrect assumption?  The boss isn't stunnable, so no one would be wasting their time doing that.  Yet they have these stuns and need to use them somewhere, correct?  I would expect a raid to unload their HoJ's, CB's, KS's and so forth on said mobs, in an attempt to lower the damage they are inflictin upon the raid.  If that is the case, what exactly is the Blackout accomplishing for you?  It's costing you 5 talent points to see an immune message or to have it proc during a time the mob was already stunned anyway.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, I think it's pretty much impossible to say "I don't want more mana regen."  Some people will say it to be contrary, but if that saves you a mana pot, isn't that a far better return on investment?  Even if you don't "Need" it, it's a nice bonus when it does happen.  I guess I just don't see how blackout is min/maxing anything even if you assume best case scenario and no one else has any talents that would be causing the mob to go immune to it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>1) The trash pulls where blackout helps are the ones where each tank is handling more than one monster.  The chance of revenge stunning the guy you are damaging is low, if the tank even has improved revenge.<br>
<br>
2) There aren't enough talent points for a serious raid specced fire mage to have impact.  Even if he did, in the situations where a stun is possible, the mage is far more likely to be using some AoE spell instead of Fireball.  And a shadow priest will have almost twice as many spell casts on the same monster.  So in the single target situation where you happen to be attacking the same target as a mage who actually has impact, it's more likely that you blackouts will cause diminishing returns on his impacts, not the other way around.  That implies the problem is with his spec (which true).<br>
<br>
3) Proc stuns don't share the same cooldown as targetted stuns like Conc Blow and Hammer of Justice.  That concern is also a non-issue.  But even if they did, the chance of targettet stuns being used on you DPS target in an AoE setting is low.<br>
<br>
Lets put this to rest, please.  Both talents are marginal.  If we could choose even something terrible like +5 m/5 for 5 talent point, I'm sure we'd take it over both Spirit Tap and Blackout.<br>
<br>
Getting things back on track, there was a request in the holy priest thread for a section on how to maximize your Shadow Fiend.  On that note, I had things to add to our FAQ's section on fiends:<br>
<br>
A) Make sure you release the fiend behind the target.  This will prevent early deaths from cleaves as well as parries on the boss (which not only reduce your mana return, but increase spike damage on the tank).<br>
<br>
B) Since the fiend gets a bonus from spell damage, you can get a little extra mana by timing the fiend with your spell damage trinket activation.  You can get 30% extra mana if you release him before you are bloodlusted.  This will almost always be an entire mana bar if he lives for the whole duration.<br>
<br>
C) The fiend does NOT get a share of your spell haste.  However, he does get more damage from strength and attack power buffs you have.  If your shaman has mana to spare, dropping Strength of Earth when you release a shadow fiend will increase mana returns as well.  They will almost never remember to do this even if they do have a free cooldown.<br>
<br>
D) The shadow fiend's damage is shadow-physical.  That means the damage is affected by anything that affects your shadow damage (eg. Shadow Weaving, Curse of Shadows), but is also mitigated by armor.  You will get a lot more damage if the boss has a full suite of armor reduction debuffs (Sunder, Faerie Fire, Curse of Recklessness).  Check if these are up before releasing your fiend.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Well guess what? Perhaps neither of those talents were intended to be a big player in boss fights. Saying who cares on trash is your problem, and does not discount the value of the talents and how they perform on trash. If you don't care about trash, then go in 0/0/0, and naked. Because you don't care. Performance is performance. Anything you can do to make trash faster and smoother is always a big help. I'm tired of people acting like they should not give two squirts of piss about trash. It's primarily the reason in a raid instance that is being farmed that guilds die more often on trash than they do on the bosses. You're dilusional if you think BT farming guilds never ever die on trash.</div>

</div>I'm sorry you are taking this so personally, but why do YOU care about MY attitude for MY guild?  We don't have trash issues, and I can assure you I put 110% effort into all fights, including trash.  Sounds like you should have this talk within your own guild, not on the EJ boards.<br>
<br>
When evaluating these talents for trash, its still a wash.  Blackout hardly makes a dent in the incoming damage.  Spirit Tap still regains a marginal ammount of mana.  You can try to talk up a marginal talent all you want, but they are still about equal.  <br>

		<div id="post_message_515014">One point I would add for blackout is that I often found that it was more trouble than it was worth on trash.  Yes it would reduce incoming damage a little bit, but it caused a lot of problems with mob positioning.<br>
<br>
I couldnt dot the incoming mobs because if blackout went off then the mob would just stand around while the rest of the raid had to wait for blackout to wear off and the mob to arrive.<br>
<br>
Also anytime we were trying to reposition mobs, for example to gather them for AEing, again blackout procs would delay this repositioning.<br>
<br>
In either case the overall raid damage lost far outweighed the minor benefit of reduced incoming damage.  I eventually respecced to spirit tap and happily that was the end of the raid calls of "Fucking blackout again".</div>

Incoming mobs belong on the tank to position, not dps to start. Feel free to dps when the mobs are where they are supposed to be. Reducing incoming damage is not the only thing it does. You have spell pushback, you have any utility the mob has (spell reflect, CC, silence, etc), random charges, etc. a sitting duck mob is many great things.<br>
<br>
In the grand scheme, both talents offer little benefit, which isn't a big deal, since they're tier 1. But if you're min maxing, you're choosing a talent that can benefit 25 people vs one that benefits only up to 5 (extra mana for you to dps to give potentially 4 extra people more mana), and even then can be replaced by consumables, while the other doesn't have a purchaseable alternative.</div>

</div>While that's true, having to do this is a sign that your tank's threat generation is poor.  Even without agility, you can just use the touch / pain / flay efficiency cycle which will never run out of mana.  So it's not clear mental agility really buys you that much in this situation.<br>
<br>
On the subject of threat generation, our main tank still uses a King's Defender I believe, and going full damage on Illidan, I was unable to pull aggro.  Plus they cycle two shaman in and out of our group so we got mana tide every 3 minutes and bloodlust every 5.  I find pulling aggro to be almost impossible unless Vampiric Embrace isn't overhealing.  Perhaps the real issue is the tank's threat generation rotation.</div>

</div>The usual reply to that is to get better tanks, as you have noted.  There are more fights that are not threat-capped than there are fights that are threat-capped.  From a min/max perspective you should almost always have shadow power.  You can always just DoT+Flay and still be spec'd for Shadow Power.<br>
<br>
If you're already not using Blast / Death, then Mental Agility is approximatly 13MP/5, with no option of added MP/5 benefit on non-capped fights.  Basically its like paying 6 talent points to have a permanent mana oil on your weapon.<br>
<br>
EDIT:<br>
Another exception is if you are so far beyond the hit cap that you can drop to 1 or 2/5 Shadow Focus and put 1-2 points into MA.</div>

The only reason not to get shadow power is if you never (or very rarely) cast MB/SWD.  Because if you don't cast either of those then shadow power provides zero benefit.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">While that's true, having to do this is a sign that your tank's threat generation is poor.  Even without agility, you can just use the touch / pain / flay efficiency cycle which will never run out of mana.  So it's not clear mental agility really buys you that much in this situation.<br>
<br>
On the subject of threat generation, our main tank still uses a King's Defender I believe, and going full damage on Illidan, I was unable to pull aggro.  <i><b>Plus they cycle two shaman in and out of our group so we got mana tide every 3 minutes and bloodlust every 5</b></i>.  I find pulling aggro to be almost impossible unless Vampiric Embrace isn't overhealing.  Perhaps the real issue is the tank's threat generation rotation.</div>

</div>I looked at some random Illidan parses on WWS a bit before this and confirmed that Shadow Priests were almost always the top casters, even when the mages were specced arcane.  I think you are right that parasites are the reason.  Mages have to kill them, hunters need to refresh frost traps, and one warlock will have heavy resistance gear on.  Shadow Priests are the only ranged DPS that can stay on the boss full time.  Well, elemental shaman can too, but we sadly don't have one of those.  Maybe next patch someone will respec.<br>
<br>
On the subject of Illidan, I find it one of the few fights where it's literally impossible to run out of mana.  Between mana tides and getting multiple uses of shadow fiend, even a full burn cycle won't run me dry.  This tells me I use Destruction potions, which I previously just used on Gurtogg.  What other fights have people found destruction potions useful on?  Might be worth adding a few lines in the root post on this issue.<br>
<br>
Also regarding tank threat generation, it just occurred to me that the real unsung heros might be the hunters in my guild.  We have three and usually bring all of them, and at least some of them are great at using misdirection when it cools down.  I've consistently noticed a spike in threat at the 2 minute mark, but never thought much about why until now.  If your tanks have trouble with threat, make sure your hunters misdirect more than once.  It helps a ton.</div>

</div>I have to pop mana pots on each cd until after p2 (maybe one after p2) - then again, I did 9.1M dmg on Illidan last time...trying to find the wws, our raid lead said it was screwed on his computer.  But yeah, it depends on the rest of your dps.  We were a bit low on casters so P2 took a bit longer because of the melee getting cut off.  That and I said damn the torpedoes and refresh dots during p2 since we have an aff lock tank instead of a destro or demo lock (more effective imo because he can have a full stack ticking when he changes then switch to searing pain)<br>
<br>
I maintained like 1200dps sustained on Illidan though, even with the downtime (so it was more like 1390dps overall if you remove downtime where my dots were ticking but I was running back for demon spawns, etc).  I definitely save skull of guldan and destro pots for weakened phases and have gotten close to 10k mindblasts though. It's fun &gt;.&gt;....<br>
<br>
But yeah, we're the only caster dps class other then non tanking warlocks that can dps illidan full time - and even with warlocks dpsing the entire time, the ability to SW:D brings us *a lot* closer and as well as the fact we can leave dots up easily (since all our locks but 1 are destro).<br>
<br>
Also, hunters are awesome at illidan.  Not only do they bring the dps there - they definitely own the night with solid misdirects that make it so I can SW:D right after an inner focus SW:P on the pull - and pretty much anywhere in the fight.  The only time I ever worry is p2 with the amout of ve healing i'm doing - but I've never pulled aggro off our druid and he's getting misdirects and all, so I credit the hunters a lot there.</div>

Death crits are in the 4k range if Shadow Vulnerability is up.

Death crits are in the 4k range if Shadow Vulnerability is up.  Between that and a fireball, you could be putting an unnecessary strain on the healers, and I know they have burst healing situations in phase 2.  (For example, when they have to cross a flame patch.)</div>

</div>Intricacy is Intricacy<br>
Nikita did, indeed, join DnT for a short stint but, iirc, had to quit due to RL concerns.<br>
<br>
It's hard to keep up.<br>
<br>
As for something constructive...<br>
<br>
SW:D on Illidan when he's in Demon Form seems a bit iffy also.  I've definitely been a little too focused on Shadow Demons before and not noticed that a gnome was standing right under me and taken double damage from the flame barrage.  <br>
<br>
Granted, I could be more careful, but Illidan at this point doesn't seem like the sort of fight where it's really worth taking the sort of risks associated with frequent use of SW:D, aside from killing parasites with it and using it on stages that you can truly predict the sort of additional damage you may take (p1, human form p3).<br>
<br>
Edit:  stupid smilies.</div>

Anyhow, I didn't have any issues with threat at all and that was with Scorned tanking that week, not Paches.  But both are considerably well geared and I believe they don't tank Teron in a full mitigation set, rather they use a set that's designed for max threat while remaining capped on def.<br>

I've missed most of the T6 content the last 2 weeks due to connection problems so I'm eager to get back and see what I can do either on Teron or Rage, if I don't get any D&amp;D's to move from.  I also have full T6 now, back then I think I still had 3/5.</div>

I recently started gearing up my shadowpriest for raiding SCC and TK. And I followed your guide, looking at the gear mostly. I got all the stuff crafted, the only thing I am missing is the Spellstrike Hood and the two trinkets.<br>
<br>
My question is, is it wise too sacrifice so much Stam for +damage and healing? Right now I am sitting on 973+ shadow spell damage and only 6.4k hp unbuffed..<br>
<br>
Whats the "healthy limit"?<br>

My question is, is it wise too sacrifice so much Stam for +damage and healing? Right now I am sitting on 973+ shadow spell damage and only 6.4k hp unbuffed..<br>

I bet you will soon be doing ZA, as the rewards are better and you only need 10.  There is a lot of damage that hits random people, 9k is the minimum, the best way to get it is using some PvP and Arena rewards.<br>
<br>
For SSC/TK, 8k buffed is the bare minimum.</div>

Al'ar: have at least 6k buffed to survive meteor.<br>

Solarian: Have at least 6k hp buffed, you can shield yourself if you get missiled.<br>

Hydross: Nothing special needed, unless you go to 100% mark and healers aren't good at healing the tombs.<br>

</div>Personal preference really, so it's not necessarily wrong.  The rule of thumb is run with whatever gear you have, if you find out you're dying unnecessarily to a lot of incidental damage, then start beefing it up either with alternative drops or pvp gear.  Myself, I wouldn't feel comfortable with less than 8k hp buffed in SSC or TK. <br>
<br>
By the way, you forgot that you can get graved at Morogrim, so 3.5k hp is not exactly what you'd want to be running with.  (not that it's even possible but the point still stands.)</div>

</div>Yeah, pretty much never. Maybe in the very rare instance that I sucked on rotation and somehow began a MF cast with 2s left on a VT CD (and I should have just waited the .5s). Even then, unless my groups mana is seriously in jeopardy, I'd probably just deal with my mistake and recast VT a few seconds later.<br>
<br>
Sometimes, on trash or adds (Hyjal especially), I will cut an MF short to for a SWD to steal a KB and a spirit tap proc, but this hardly ever applies to bosses (Vashj, maybe KT weps).</div>

</div>Consistely cutting your MF cast at .9 seconds, or 1.9 seconds means you are wasting a full .9 seconds of DPS time for no reason. It's somewhat difficult considering server/client latency (1/4 to 1/2 second in some cases) to properly time your "cut" of the MF to coincide with a tick. Over the course of a fight you could be actually losing dps by consistently doing this.<br>
<br>
.9 seconds X 10 messed up MF casts over the course of a fight is 9 seconds of DPS time you wasted. It's a fine line and not usually worth the gamble. <br>
<br>
Kind of similar to how /stopcasting macros used improperly will lower your dps, <i>especially</i> on fights with any kind of pushback.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, if you're amazing at latency management and you can cut your MF cast at the exact moment it tics you wont lose any DPS time and you'll effectively improve your DPS (but your DPM).</div>

</div>Not to be elitist, but considering your guilds place in progression you might not understand until you've done it. Sometimes you don't get to drink between waves because of a few deaths, this means there are times when you are completely OOM (and have to pot/shadowfiend etc.). When you're AOEing down 8 mobs at the same time it's quite easy to pick one at low HP and finish it with SWD.<br>
<br>
My strategy on Hyjal trash involves: single targeting the first mobs while tanks build aggro for aoe, dotting every aoe target to get misery/SW up, mind flaying and mind blasting and refreshing dots on those targets to build more SW stacks. To be honest, it's pretty easy to steal killing blows, and yes, often times, dotting every target runs you near OOM and spirit tap helps during and between phases.<br>
<br>
I have spirit tap, I might as well get a use out of it where I can (which is somewhat rare). If I had blackout, I wouldn't bother, obviously.<br>
<br>
Edit: With regards to Vashj adds, Phase 2-3 Vashj is somewhat mana intensive, getting a few spirit tap procs on striders can mean the difference between running a full dps cycle on phase 3 and running VT/flay only.</div>

</div>First, you'll want to clean up your post a bit, use proper punctuation and the like.<br>
<br>
Secondly, that depends on many factors.  Are you getting CoS?  Do you have several warlocks that keep a good ISB uptime?  Do you have a shaman in your group for WoA?  What about raid buffs, do you have Divine Spirit, do you have BoW, do you have mana spring totem, do you have good mp/5 and/or spirit on your gear?  (T6 of course covers both)<br>
<br>
For example, on a random BT run I looked at, my average MF tick was for ~800.  That's 40 mana back each tick, or 120 total.  MF is 196 mana to cast, properly talented.  So if I can regen 76 mana every 3 seconds while casting, I'll be mana-neutral while casting it.  That's the same as having 127 mp/5 while casting on your character screen.  Completely unbuffed, I have 80 mp/5 while casting, so a simple talented BoW would put me up to almost 130 mp/5 while casting.  Hence I'd be able to cast MF and actually come out slightly ahead in mana at the end, on average.  In boss fights my average actually comes out to be slightly higher on MF, I usually see +44 or +45 mana gained ticks scroll by on my SCT.  <br>
<br>
Hopefully that answers your question -- you can't really say there's a certain amount of +dmg that you need because that's only part of the equation.  But for what it's worth I usually run with +1318 damage in most fights.  (wtb Nethervoid Cloak)</div>

		<div id="post_message_523188">In fact you have to time your next spell after mindflay well regardless of if you cut it short or not. It's either trying to do it close to the 2nd tick or the 3rd tick, it's really just as difficult when you think about it. If you cut out the last tick you'll have some delay of safety (as you definitely don't want to interrupt MF 0.1s before it ticks, better to do it 0.3s after the tick), but you would get the same kind of delay if you cast another spell *after* the last tick as you need to take the same safety measure to not interrupt MF 0.1s before the 3rd tick.<br>
Bottom line - casting the MB/SW when they come up mid-MF right after a tick instead of after the MF should increase your DPS regardless of your ability to time it well.<br>
Your DPM will go down though, as you're cutting a spell short after paying the mana for it AND you're doing it for a less mana-efficient spell. If you have any kind of mana problems this is most definitely out of question. However to maximize DPS I see no reason not to get used to doing it.</div>

</div>And yet you're not the only single target dps class in your raid (most likely). Sure you have a nice burst combo, but so do other classes and they might get the killing blow as well. Just because I haven't been into Hyjal doesn't mean I couldn't possibly understand how this concept works in practice (because I've never done a gauntlet type encounter before *coughsupressionroomcough*), except in this case each mob has significantly more life overall than aoeing a dozen small mobs.<br>
<br>
You're more likely to get spirit tap procs from a trash wave, but you're still relying on something you can only merely hope to get (you're not the only one who can burst for a killing blow). Unless you somehow manage to talk your raiders into not attacking your targeted mob during an AoE phase, I don't see spirit tap going off often enough and reliably enough to justify its benefit in a raid.</div>

Spirit tap proc'd 22 times for me. Blackout proc'd 13 times for our other shadow priest. Note: this wasn't even Hyjal, this was simply BT trash.<br>

<br>
One of these talents is required and both offer minimal benefits. Again, I have spirit tap, and I'm going to try to make use of it. If that means cutting an MF short on trash and using MB/SWD to get a few KBs here and there for regen then I'm going to do it and make use of my talent points. However, lets please <i>not</i> turn this back into a spirit tap vs. blackout discussion. We beat that horse dead already.<br>
<br>
With regards to your comment on Hyjal trash not being similar to the suppression room trash because you're AOEing a dozen small mobs. Well, it just so happens that most hyjal trash waves are 12 mobs, and we AOE a lot of them. So it is exactly the situation you're describing. When you have a constant stream of AOE, and a mod that calculates mob HP, it's somewhat easy to time a killing blow. I'd say I can get it ~50% of the time when I try to.</div>

		<div id="post_message_525979">About the Hunter &gt; Warlock in a shadow priest group. When I was raiding I would have been slightly annoyed if a hunter got put in a shadow priest group over me because of a few reasons.<br>
<br>
1. Lifetap is a loss of dps, a lot more than most people realise. (And also ISB uptime I guess which = less dps for the shadow damage dealers.)<br>
2. We had an elemental shaman in the group aswell and WoA and ToW mean nothing to a hunter. Even if it was a resto shaman I'd still probably be missing WoA.<br>
3. I'm not too sure on hunter mechanics but the hunters in our guild never seemed to run out of mana, they guzzled fel mana potions like no tomorrow though.<br>
4. Even when I do need to life tap, vampiric embrace heals a hell of a lot and less pressure on healers is a good thing.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying it's bad for hunters to be in a shadow priest group, I just think a destro lock benefits more.</div>

		<div id="post_message_526037">Hello Triza, Good to see Jubie members posting here,<br>
<br>
About the hunter vs warlock for the shadow priest group,<br>
<br>
Sure warlocks not needing to life tap helps there dps,<br>
<br>
But for a Hunter to function they need to be chain potting and even then its normally not enough to keep me going for more than ~6minutes.<br>
<br>
I am BM which is considered one of the more mana efficient specs due to the rotation we use,<br>
<br>
A MM hunter needs a ShadowPriest the most of any spec but back to the point.<br>
<br>
Alot of fights we need a shadow priest to remain competitive damage dealers, fights with alot of AOE even more so, as mend pet is a rather large mana investment, the shadow priest helps by healing the pet and giving me mana to heal it.<br>
<br>
I am usually queit the opposite to you, I am annoyed when a Warlock is given a shado priest over me, you are probably the most self sufficient class's in the game, Sure it requires some GCD management to do but in many cases a Shadow Priest is a requirement for hunter dps.<br>
<br>
EDIT : The exception is if Judgement of Wisdom is on the mob, then you could pursade me to let you have the shadow priest group, As a hunter the ammount of mana returned by this is phenomenal.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">This change does seem to indicate that Unbreakable Will does jump in terms of usefulness. This drastically changes the use of Fear Ward.  IF MTs can hold aggro during fears, than perhaps the most utility for fear wards would be healers rather than tanks?  Though, i guess on position sensitive encounters not having the MT run around the room getting chased is desirable.</div>

</div>Fear ward is essentially going to be useless in PVE. It's being drastically changed period. You can basically fear ward one player in a raid and / or protect multiple players one time.<br>
<br>
Once the fear ward charge is "consumed" you'll have to get a 2nd priest to put it up unless it's been 3 mins between charge consumption. And you're going to have to have several priests to make it even somewhat effective. Our normal raid has 2-3 holy priests. Currently, none of them have fear ward. I can't imagine any of them using it going forward except as some sort of "Gee, we have fear ward after 3 years" button.</div>

</div>Point number one: Not all warlock specs are as self-sufficient as you think; 0.21.40 destrolocks eat mana like it's going out of fashion, and tapping themselves dry costs them a very signifficant amount of time, leaving them at low HP making more strain on (a) themselves incase they get an environmental effect that kills them (b) the healers who have to chuck them HOTs (c) Their own DPS, as tapped mana only goes so far: Within the next 20sec they'll have to tap again, and again, and again. Theres no point in having a lock in a raid if he spends 15% of his time tapping and costs 10% of a healer's time and mana to keep him from suiciding.<br>
<br>
Point number two: You're reffering to Judgement of Wisdom for the 74 mana returned.<br>
<br>
Honestly, as far as I'm concerned the most mana regen a hunter should be getting is a manaspring from being in the melee group team, if there is space and if there isn't a windfury down (perish the thought) but rather a GoA.</div>

		<div id="post_message_526096">The main reason for warlocks usually getting the shadow priest over a hunter isn't really the fact that they need it more, because imo hunter gets more out of it, especially in a fight with any kind of movement. The reason is that the shadow priest usually has WoA as well with the occasional totem of wrath (mage group), which will not benefit the hunter at all...<br>
If you have 2 shadow priests though and your healers are good you can put the 2nd in the hunter/leftover group isntead of the healer group, but it also pretty much requires that there is no melee DPS in your raid outside of the MT group and windfury group, as that melee DPS would usually be a warrior/druid to be put with the hunter for extra AP/crit and getting trueshot if there's a marksmanship hunter or FI from a BM (or both). Putting a shadow priest in that group just to benefit 2-3 people isn't reasonable unless your healers really totally don't need a shadow priest, or the DPS loss by having the warrior/feral not getting trueshot/FI and the hunters not getting BS/LotP gets more than made up for by giving the hunters a shadow priest.<br>
Overall there are situations where hunters get a shadow priest with 2 shaodw priests in the raid, but they just don't seem to happen all that much with the raid compositions I've been seeing.<br>
Of course when you have 3 shadow priests in the raid every mana user not in the MT/WF groups gets a shadow priest and you have no arguments (except those bitching at being on devo/tree aura or WF duty, but someone needs to do it).</div>

</div>I realise the difference in specs, But we dont raid with any destro locks so I didnt seperate specs which was my fault and I should have made that more clear,<br>

I would consider a destro lock as similar to a mage in mana regen so would take precedence over hunter for the Spriest,<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Not to be elitist, but considering your guilds place in progression you might not understand until you've done it. Sometimes you don't get to drink between waves because of a few deaths, this means there are times when you are completely OOM (and have to pot/shadowfiend etc.). When you're AOEing down 8 mobs at the same time it's quite easy to pick one at low HP and finish it with SWD.<br>
<br>
My strategy on Hyjal trash involves: single targeting the first mobs while tanks build aggro for aoe, dotting every aoe target to get misery/SW up, mind flaying and mind blasting and refreshing dots on those targets to build more SW stacks. To be honest, it's pretty easy to steal killing blows, and yes, often times, dotting every target runs you near OOM and spirit tap helps during and between phases.<br>
<br>
I have spirit tap, I might as well get a use out of it where I can (which is somewhat rare). If I had blackout, I wouldn't bother, obviously.<br>
<br>
Edit: With regards to Vashj adds, Phase 2-3 Vashj is somewhat mana intensive, getting a few spirit tap procs on striders can mean the difference between running a full dps cycle on phase 3 and running VT/flay only.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Caligula I'm pretty disappointed that you just played the progression card.  I think this debate on Spirit Tap vs Black Out has been drawn out far too long, and is no longer constructive, as it seems you gentlemen are beating a dead horse.  The same points are getting re-hashed at different stages in the game and the same counterpoints exist.  Keep in mind its all up to your own preference at this point.  I suggest Black Out since my own experience(s) in hyjal/bt (hyjal in particular) seem to have sloppy trash kills every so often,  or trash where me assisting with shackles/occasional B.O. proc saves someone.  Not that guilds -should- have that sort of sloppiness, but really when it comes to application, occasional mistakes are made/bad luck can ensue (eg mob dodges/parries everything tank throws at it, or some AoE'er manages to crit that mob, and only that mob).<br>
<br>
<br>
P.S.  Personally, with the gear I have now, I really don't have many mana issues, and I personally use black out.  I love having the ability to stun a trash target, and possibly save a guildmate from certain doom.  Granted I cant stun any of the bosses, but generally you aren't getting spirit tap either (maybe 3/9 bt bosses [tops], and 0/5 hyjal boss fights?).</div>

</div>Eh, I can't say we have aggro issues, but I think that we could do a bit more, our tanks are pretty conservative for most fights and prefer mitigation gear vs theat gear.  It should also be noted that we are still rather new to most of bt, and are on reliquary now, so we should start seeing a progressive threat increase on our tanks, and a healthy dps increase.  As it is with my gear, pulling 1300 dps would be really lucky, but that would probably get me killed.  Generally pulling 1300 or so dps for that fight requires deathing each time the CD is up, but last week I got hit with that 60% shadow damage debuff 3-4 times.  With the looming threat of his flame attack nearly insta-gibbing me its a rather risky route to take.  By the way, 1545 dps is pretty insane, but you had a 44% mindblast crit rate while rocking the 4 set bonus (and a 36% death crit rate) - also you didnt get a single flame debuff, and only one shadow debuff - [jealous].</div>

		<div id="post_message_526482">Do you actually use SW:D a lot in Hyjal/BT? I think I have had SW:D kill me in pretty much every fight there. <br>
<br>
I have died to SW:D+spine+his icebolt thing at naj'entus, died to SW:D at teron giving me his shadow vulnerability thingy and a shadowbolt just as I used SW:D, I won't even mention gurtogg, SW:D at ros has killed me after taking 2 soul drains ticks+crit SW:D (before the soul drains obviously), I really don't want to risk it in p.3 with all the damage going around. FA after SW:D was also fun even if I guess it's less dangerous now our healers are quicker, Illidari council just ave a truckton of abilities waiting to gank you after an SW:D. Illidan I could use it in human phase, but I am too afraid in p.2 both for aggro and health issues. I am using it on demons in p.4 though.<br>
<br>
In Hyjal, I have died to icebolt right after SW:D (really split seconds later), I use it at anetheron when an infernal landing isn't close, I use it on kaz anyway, SW:D+rof on azgalor is really fun and SW:D on Archimonde, brrrrr, I don't even want to take much lower risks there. <br>
<br>
Contrary to that I was using SW:D a lot more on ssc/tk, damage taken felt a lot more predictable/sporadic/avoidable there. Also with my +damage reaching the higher 1200's I have crit myself for 4600 or so with SW:D and pretty much something sneezing on me would kill me. I don't really feel that safe using it a lot.<br>
<br>
Now the healers have managed to save me in a lot of those situations but have failed as well (or in some of those they couldn't do much objectively). Due to that I have grown a dislike for SW:D as in a lot of those fights my potential death could lead to much bigger problems than x more dps I would do with SW:D.  I understand it's a theorycraft thread, but are people actually using SW:D to such an extent, especially on fights they aren't very comfortable with yet?</div>

</div>I don't think I've been quite that unlucky, but I do cast SWD a lot less.  Much like pre-BT/Hyjal SWD is a calculated risk.  If you can handle the HP drain, Death away.  If the damage may reduce your HP below an acceptable threshold, then don't cast it.  <br>
<br>
Naj'entus, for example, I just don't SWD.  SWD crit + Random Ice Attack + Spine could kill me at any time.  Its just not worth the risk to me.  Supremus, I go all out with Death.  Damage there is almost 100% avoidable once you've seen the fight.  It's all about the risk/reward level that you're comfortable with.</div>

The result is that I'd rather stay full health and not distract a healer on a fight like Council (and other fights like gurtogg where threat is an issue) than go for that extra bit of dps to put me higher on the meters. When you couple that with the fact that so many BT/hyjal fights are about survival first and foremost, SWD is really a liability.

		<div id="post_message_526536">I'm much the same way with regards to death usage.  I'll use it all the time at Rage though, because the pvp trinket is a free icebolt removal.  But in a fight like Council, I probably only use it a quarter of the time -- usually right after I see a flamestrike land somewhere.  Some of it in other fights depends on your HP pool, I run at or over 10k buffed, so I can death with impunity at Najentus and not really worry about gibbing.  Teron, I use it all the time unless I have the Crushing Shadows debuff.   The point about not distracting your healers on some fights is a very good one, especially if your healers are very good at just playing whack a mole with Grid.  That's why I'm conservative with it on Council, there's already enough raid damage being thrown around as it is without having someone toss me a heal because they see me 3k hp down.</div>

		<div id="post_message_526565">I've been chanting that "dead shadowpriest don't do dps" mantra for quite some time on these forums, my suggestion would be to just death when it feels right.  Most fights in hyjal/bt have some rather impressive splash damage to the group, and the potential insta gib in many as well.  On some fights where the burst is predictable e.g. Najentus deathing is no problem at all.  However, I think meltface has it right in terms of death simply being a calculated risk.<br>
<br>
I myself don't believe death is as much a liability anymore as I once did when I was still green to the endgame encounters, rather, I just use it when the opportunity presents itself.  Most fights actually I feel deathing is appropriate at any time, given you don't put yourself at risk of nuking yourself.  Every fight in Hyjal except for Azgalor I'm doing my usual buttonmash dps rotation, and I do awesome caster dps, with no problems.  Even on Azgalor now I'm starting to death more often, once I see the fire spawn I know I'm free to do a death or two before the next rain of fire comes (shielding before the second death occasionally as well).  I think for fights like Gurtogg where unholy amounts of group damage are being taken, deathing is only appropriate during the fel rages, unless you are well topped off (personally, I don't death in the non fel rage phases because I'm horribly threat capped even without improved ve).</div>

		<div id="post_message_527182">Hey again,<br>
<br>
I wanna reply too what somebody said a few pages ago about the minimum health requirement for raiding. Personally, I think there is no minimum requirement and I think you should go all out with damage. Even if thats means losing a few hundred hit points. I am currently raiding with about 6.6k unbuffed hp and I get yelled at by my raid leader. It is much more important too counter random aoe damage than too get the boss down as fast as we can he says..<br>
<br>
On one side I agree with him, but on the other side I think it's not really realisitic. Why shouldnt I optimize my character for as much dps as possible??<br>
<br>
I will give you one example, we were doing a Karazhan run the other day and we killed Maide.<br>
<br>
I have the Bracers Of Havok equipped and I am loving them. 39 spelldamage on bracers sure is alot. My raid leader said that I should take the bracers from Maiden since nobody else wanted them. I didnt want too use them because i lose damage but I gain 21 stamina. Stamina I dont think I need alot on the most boss fights.<br>
<br>
Am I maybe taking my obsession for pure shadowdamage too far or should I just try too keep up maxing my shadowdamage and sacrifice maybe even more stats?<br>
<br>
*Of course I am well aware that there are some fights where there is a base hp required and I have gear too get that but I would sacrifice alot of damage too get there*</div>

On the topic of Naj'entus and SWD, though...We just started him last night and did miserably. I noticed that I'd end up about 20k behind the other shadow priest with no explanation, and I know he doesn't really use Death much at all or even MB on fights where there's no insane raid damage. I was baffled by this, but apparently the shaman in my group was moved over to the other side of Naj's room to keep an eye on the mages--leaving me out of range of his totems, or so he says. Could this account for such a huge damage difference?<br>
<br>
I was browsing through the Naj'entus WWS parses on shadowpriest.com and noticed that many priests DO use Death on him. I cut it out of my rotation entirely for that fight. Do any of you use it? I hit about 11.5k HP last night with raid buffs and an imp, but I've never heard the SCT HP warning go off so many times. -.- I was terrified of using Death. :s</div>

I was above the other shadow priest by 56214 damage and had an average DPS that was 217 above his.  If you ended up 20k behind your friend, that means you did about 77 less DPS, judging from my data.  The 100 spell damage does not close that gap, though it contributes to it.  Nor is it the gap from being threat capped with tranquil air versus threat capped without tranqil air.  So I'm not sure what it is.  Have a WWS parse?</div>

</div>hmmmm,<br>
that got me thinking--<br>
<br>
Due to mind flay's channeling mechanic, it fails early and only suffers half time penalty.  So lets pretend you are attacking Gathios the Shatterer.  250 shadow resist against your level 70 spells will cause ~53% failure on binary and average ~53% damage lost on direct.<br>
<br>
Resists with mindblast = 1357 dps (53% loss) = 2888 dps * .47   <br>
Resists with mindflay = 543 dps (36% loss) = (850 * .43 *3) / (.47*3+.53*1.5)<br>
<br>
Generic formula for MB damage with resistance:<br>
DPS * (1-resist%)<br>
Generic formula for MF damage with resistance:<br>
2 * DPS * (1-resist%) / (2-resist%)<br>
<br>
Mind blast is still better (nor does DPM change), but it is interesting to see mind flay improve.<br>

And people say our threat is fine . Our main benefit is our mana regen and we'd have to do half the damage we do now to not be nearly as viable to take a raid spot. Because of that our class becomes less fun to play with shorter range primary spells, channeled with no pushback, and the fun fun fun of having no honest aggro reduction spells so we get to play around on too many fights instead of getting to maintain a consistent dps rotation.<br>
<br>
I can understand a standard threat wipe mechanic that affects everyone, but because you are doing 3 things at once (mpr, hpr, dps) you get to play less, since your aggro skyrockets so fast on standard aggro generation phases.</div>

		<div id="post_message_529942">You can't expect to both heal everyone, give them mana AND do competitive DPS and *still* not pull aggro, can you?<br>
<br>
How effective do you think it would actually be to drop VE on those fights at least part-time to make yourself able to do more damage and regen more mana to your group, and let the healers handle the healing? Giving up your tetriary job so you can do your primary and secondary seems to be efficient to me unless those fights really are more about VE healing your group than DPSing the boss and regening mana. Anyway my point is that if your problem in the fight is mana and DPS, rather than healing, and you have threat problems, dropping VE shouldn't be out of question, as it may be better than dropping your DPS. You can only do so much without pulling aggro.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Thanks , thats a clear answer finally. Because most of the shadowpriests on my server who have progressed far. They all have +spelldamage and +stam in their gear. One of them even had a +12 stam gem in their gear. So there really isnt anyone on my server too talk too about this kind off stuff.<br>
<br>
Why would they use +stam gems in their gear? *confused* and how come they have progressed so far (MH and BT almost cleared) if they gear so awkard?</div>

</div>One of the mantras brought up about shadow priests is that damage is all that matters and stamina is of far far less importance.<br>
<br>
It is certainly true that maximising your potential as a shadow priest requires maximising your damage.  However swapping damage for stamina will increase your chances of surviving.  This is not necessarily a bad thing, in fact in Hyjal/BT it is required to some extent.  Damage output doesn't plummet but swapping a 12 damage gem for a 12 stamina gem, it's a pretty minor reduction.<br>
<br>
Now, if you play perfectly, have a lag free connection and never have fat fingers then this minimises the amount of health you require.  In these circumstances, using damage gems, damage enchants and maximising your damage at the cost of stamina is the appropriate choice.<br>
<br>
On the other hand you need to take a realistic view of how good you are at the game.  Everyone makes mistakes, the very best players make hardly any whereas the not so good players make a lot more.  More health increases your chance of surviving these mistakes, so unless you play perfectly all the time then it may be worth trading damage for health.  This will increase your output over the full length of the fight because damage tapers off rapidly after death.<br>
<br>
At the end of the day it is a decision for the individual based on how well they play (and also on the particular encounter).  If you find yourself dying more than occasionally then besides learning2play it would be good to consider sacrifing damage to put more stamina on your gear.<br>
<br>
A shadow priest who almost never dies and does 90% of his potential full damage is much more valuable to a raid than a priest who does maximum damage but dies on every fifth fight.</div>

</div>Well losing 12 spell damage is roughly 20/9 * 12 = 80/3 = 26 DPS loss, which is 2% to 3%.  That really is a lot to lose even if you were getting the equivalent 15 stamina gem for 165 health.<br>
<br>
The other problem is that on most fights, living or dieing is more about reaching a certain threshold to withstand a certain amount of damage, and beyond that stamina has diminishing returns.  If you're dieing from aggro, an extra 165 or even 2000 health won't help you.  If you're dieing from doomfires on Archimonde, then going over 10,000 health lets you survive your ticks instead of 3, which is great, but going to 11k doesn't let you survival the fifth tick.  Each fight has a sweet spot of stamina, beyond which you want to stack spell damage.  The good news is that pretty much every upgrade will give you a reasonable amount of stamina to reach this threshold for the upcoming raid encounters.  The only fight I had to swap gear for extra health was Naj'entus, and just for the first two weeks.</div>

You don't need a spell rotation as much as you need a spell priority order.  Typically, that's:<br>
<br>
VT<br>
SW:P<br>
MB<br>
SW<br>
MF<br>
<br>
VE's priority is based on how much you feel you need it, and how close you are to being threat capped.<br>
<br>
You seem to understand how to gear yourself, so no worries there.<br>
<br>
Taking a look at leo specifically...  Honestly, it's not a mana intensive fight, but you should try to keep VT up as much as SW:P.  Since the whirlwinds are typically hell on Mind Flaying, try to up your MB count.  You may have been holding back due to threat issues, which is all the more reason not to apply VE so liberally.  In most circumstances, VE healing is not nearly as important as mana regen or dps.</div>

		<div id="post_message_530982">The Mystical Skyfire Diamond does have a cooldown, but it also procs more often. After seeing it in action from a few ZA clears on the PTR, I prefer the new MSD over the old. The new proc rate almost guarantees a hasted MF or MB between DoT renewals. The old back-to-back procs won't happen anymore, but neither will the unlucky streaks.<br>
<br>
From a math standpoint, you're only gaining 6 damage switching from 1 Runed Crimson Spinel (+12 damage) and 1 Glowing Shadowsong Amethyst (+6 damage, +7 stamina) to 2 Veiled Pyrestones (+6 damage, +5 spell hit). Even socketing the Handguards of Absolution for the +2 spell damage bonus, the Swift Skyfire Diamond is a small damage upgrade.<br>
<br>
The MSD still seems like the clear cut choice for a raiding shadow priest.</div>

</div>I've discovered that making mistakes gets you one shotted, and you just can't have a reasonable amount of stam nor the AC to save one shot. Higher stam levels are required for the best of any dps caster class, there's wholly unavoidable encounter damage that you must suck up. Dying to mistakes will be a much better wake up call then a hit that doesn't kill you and half the raid doesn't notice because you just got NS crit healed.<br>
<br>
The best and the worst (worst can't be that bad once you're in T6 range) should both be aiming for the same stamina levels. Extra stam helps vs bad luck, not mistakes (in many cases).</div>

		<div id="post_message_532666">How did you guys in T6 content prioritize your upgrades? Outside of the obvious upgrades like Trash Mace, Cloak, and Rings, looking at Shadowpriest.com's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304060843/http://shadowpriest.com/viewtopic.php?t=6594" target="_blank">Best Raiding Gear topic</a>, there's obviously some non-T6 pieces that are better than T6 itself, however the set bonuses often push T6 over.<br>
<br>
Looking around, the <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30916"><span><span class="purplename">[Leggings of Channeled Elements]</span></span></a> off Kaz'rogal seem to be the largest improvement over the T6 counterpart, <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=31067"><span><span class="purplename">[Leggings of Absolution]</span></span></a>; so the common strategy is to aim for them over the Council. T6 Hands, <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=31061"><span><span class="purplename">[Handguards of Absolution]</span></span></a> are also a bit underwhelming, but they're the first piece available, so it seems optimal to get them in order to meet your early 2 piece set bonus.<br>
<br>
Currently, I'm thinking of going for the two Tier pieces in Hyjal, and using <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30884"><span><span class="purplename">[Hatefury Mantle]</span></span></a> in the Shoulder slots until the T6 Chest off Illidan, in which case I would switch to the T6 Shoulders, <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=31070"><span><span class="purplename">[Shoulderpads of Absolution]</span></span></a> off Mother for the 4 set bonus. This would leave me with an early 2 set bonus after Archi, and in higher DPS pieces such as Hatefury and Channeled Elements until the optimal pieces for the 4 set bonus become available, instead of moving to obvious downgrades such as T6 Legs and Shoulders.<br>
<br>
Did anyone else do something similar, or did you guys use different strategies for gearing yourself to meet your set bonuses?<br>
<br>
Actually going back to Rings, do most people run with 2 <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32527"><span><span class="purplename">[Ring of Ancient Knowledge]</span></span></a>? Or do some run with 1 and <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29305"><span><span class="purplename">[Band of the Eternal Sage]</span></span></a> or <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32247"><span><span class="purplename">[Ring of Captured Storms]</span></span></a>? As I'm currently about to enter into the T6 content with a lot of saved up DKP, just interested in seeing what the preference for other Shadow Priests in T6 content is. Thanks in advance!</div>

		<div id="post_message_532723">I chose to get the off-set items first, namely Rage's bracers, the trash cloak, Anetheron's belt, Kaz's leggings, and the spell haste ring.

So, basically, the only <u>drops</u> I need are t6 shoulders, helm, and chest.  <br>

In terms of Anetheron's shoulders...it really depends on your guild.  They haven't dropped yet for us, but I wouldn't have gotten them regardless unless no one else wanted them.  However, depending on your DKP system, they might be a good buy (we use council loot).  In that case, they're worth getting early on, but not if you're working on Gorefiend.</div>

</div>Good to hear its happened to someone else as well, yes trash drops can be very fickle. We've had 32767 tank cloaks and nary a nethervoid in a good long while. I would agree, only to add that while my strategy is similar, I'm more keen on picking up +spell hit to enable me to move points out of shadow focus and into imp MB / Shadow Power. So in that sense, I personally rated Akama's bracers higher over Rage bracers, and will probably end up choosing Devastation legs off Mother over Channeled Elements.</div>

</div>That was basically my plan as well.  However, I considered using T4 + haste shoulders instead.  I'm not sure what will be best, but I'm sure I'll have all 5 pieces in two months anyway, so I can figure it out then.<br>
<br>
One thing to consider with the Kaz'Rogal legs is that while they are slightly better than Shahraz legs and T6 legs, they are far, far superior for mages.  Aftermath uses an auction system, and the Kaz'Rogal legs are selling for twice that of Shahraz' legs.  They're also selling for more than T6, and we've been killing Kaz'Rogal for 2 months longer than council.  If your system has self correcting prices, it's very likely the mages will pay more for the legs than its worth to you.  You'd be better off taking one of the other options for a much lower price in this case, which is a nice way of saying it has a better net benefit to the raid.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Well losing 12 spell damage is roughly 20/9 * 12 = 80/3 = 26 DPS loss, which is 2% to 3%.  That really is a lot to lose even if you were getting the equivalent 15 stamina gem for 165 health.</div>

</div>This figure fails a basic sanity check. Specificly, spell damage =&gt;dps is reasonably close to linear, so if 12 spell damage was really 26 dps, people in kara gear would be doing something like 2500 dps.<br>
<br>
My napkin math* suggests the real dps loss is more like 6. Still, it's good to point out that when making tradeoffs you want to bargain hunt. Going for a lot of +5/+6 gems is marginally better than going for some 9 spell and some 12 stam; boar's speed or fortitude over vitality is a better dps trade [also, offtopic, boar's speed is really nice]. There are likely a fair number of gear choices in the mid tiers that offer you a better ratio than 2:3 too. <br>

</div>I don't think the Shade is a very good place to compare, because its not a controlled setting-- there are different roles in that fight.  But regardless, here's what I've noticed<br>
<br>
1)<br>
Phall triggered IotSC 19 times versus your 9<br>
17 innerfocus versus your 13<br>
=&gt; implies that you aren't triggering your cooldowns often enough<br>
I manually trigger my trinkets and IF, but if you need help with it, bind it to your VT button.<br>
<br>
2)<br>
His 199	crusader versus your 276<br>
=&gt; This means you are letting your buff stack wear off more times.  Are you running out of targets?  I'm pretty much constantly casting spells and searching for new targets such that I have no downtime.<br>
<br>
3)<br>
He has over 200 more pain ticks than you do, as well as 100 more VT ticks.  The interesting part is that you both have near equal VT regen ticks, so it appears its more of a spell selection issue.  Pain is our highest DPC and DPM.  Either you are not refreshing pain quick enough or he is multi-target-dotting and you are not.  Priority is pain,vt first, then mb and flay.  You have been flaying and mbings a bunch more.  The catch is, this particular fight involves add control, so I'm not sure its a good meter.<br>
<br>
4)<br>
He had a elemental shaman.  You did not.<br>
He has slightly more +shadow than you.<br>
Nothing you can do about that, the numbers should be in his favor.</div>

8% move speed also means you get away from nasty area damages more easily, and 8% is just damn huge, I'll never walk around with any of my characters without something that gives that bonus (generally boar's speed on boots is the best way to get it, for casters at least).</div>

<br>
I chose to take the Hatefury Mantle and I'm going for the other 4 pieces of T6 first (just got 2pc last night!). The shoulders aren't a huge upgrade over FSW but they do look AMAZING in shadowform. It was the first BT/Hyjal upgrade that dropped for me (so I was pretty excited to finally upgrade some items that I'd been using for 7-8 months) and I saw our mages drooling over the Kaz pants so I've passed on them multiple times and took the T6 pants instead.<br>
<br>
We also use a loot council system (mostly based on attendance and recently won loot) so we don't have to worry about DKP bidding and items getting sharded. The only time something is turned into a crystal is if everyone in the raid that can use it, has it. <br>
<br>
Also, as much as the "Maximize + damage at all costs" mantra goes. I don't really abide by it too strictly. I'm happy to take a 30 stamina/int, 8 mp/5, etc. upgrade on the t6 pants even though the Kaz pants would be a bit higher for my damage. As people have been noting, a dead player does no dps... and neither does an OOM player either.</div>

<br>
I'll just answer you in a list to make it easier for both of us ^^<br>
<br>
1. I just got my Icon and haven't had an on-use trinket for months, so I think I just haven't conditioned myself to use it every chance I get. As for IF the numbers are fairly close (4 use difference), so I may not have used it on every CD, but I do remember to use it as often as possible. I think I will give the trinket-binding-to-VT thing a shot until I get used to it (I also trigger it manually).<br>
<br>
2. I didn't notice it falling off a lot, to be honest. I wasn't running out of targets--we were on channeler duty. Not sure why the discrepancy there, but I'll try to take note of it next raid.<br>
<br>
3. I think he was dotting the channelers before the rest of us even got to the next one. Often when one was about to die we would switch to the next and Pain/VT would already be on it. Assuming he got in a full duration, that's what, 8 ticks x 6 mobs x number of attempts? I'm assuming you're looking at the full report, since the numbers you're mentioning are rather high. I would switch targets when the mob was at about 10%~ to begin DPS on the next channeler. To be quite honest I've never had an issue with dots since I learned to let them tick to their full duration. I think the multi-target nature of this fight is what's accounting for the gap. (I hope. o.O)<br>
<br>
4. I never get a shaman in raids (though I've managed to place ahead of him on some fights without one) anymore, and I'm also not an enchanter. I should be breaking the 1200 damage benchmark soon, though. ._.v<br>
<br>
I appreciate the advice a great deal. I think Akama was probably not the best measure of it--I do wish I'd gotten a WWS of our Rage kill this week where I did well (even by my standards), despite spazzing out and not putting on Wizard Oil or eating spell food. There's always the chance that I'm blowing this out of proportion, but still, I wanted to make sure I'm not missing something. :/</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I've discovered that making mistakes gets you one shotted, and you just can't have a reasonable amount of stam nor the AC to save one shot. Higher stam levels are required for the best of any dps caster class, there's wholly unavoidable encounter damage that you must suck up. Dying to mistakes will be a much better wake up call then a hit that doesn't kill you and half the raid doesn't notice because you just got NS crit healed.<br>
<br>
The best and the worst (worst can't be that bad once you're in T6 range) should both be aiming for the same stamina levels. Extra stam helps vs bad luck, not mistakes (in many cases).</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div><br>
A really big mistake, like pulling aggro will certainly get me one shotted and no amount of stamina will help.  These are very rare though.<br>
<br>
But beyond that I guess it depends what you consider them bad luck and what you consider small mistakes - I regard small mistakes as things like taking a little too long to move out of a dot/AE.<br>
<br>
As an example I died on Supremus last night.  I didn't realise there was a volcano behind me until slightly later than I should have.  By the time I ran out of it I had taken a tick more damage than I needed to, and then had another volcano spawn underneath me which then killed me.<br>
<br>
The second volcano was bad luck, but if I had been quicker to move out of the first volcano I probably wouldn't have died, or if I had been quick enough to use healthstone, pot and PW:S I would probably not have died (all I managed to use was a healthstone).  Was that bad luck, or a mistake?  A bit of both really.<br>
<br>
I don't regard this as having made a terrible mistake, just not being quite as sharp as the very best players.  And because of these kinds of issue I realise that I'm just not one of these very best players and am never likely to be.  You may say l2playbetternoob but honestly I don't have the time or inclination to practice enough to be perfect.  However, if I had more stamina I probably would have survived both volcanoes despite my mistake.<br>
<br>
If you are indeed one of the tiny minority of players who play almost perfectly and these small mistakes never happens then great, you need less stamina than me and can maximise your damage that bit more.  But for the rest of us mere mortals, stamina is a good thing and worth trading damage for.

				<div style="font-style:italic">3. I think he was dotting the channelers before the rest of us even got to the next one. Often when one was about to die we would switch to the next and Pain/VT would already be on it. Assuming he got in a full duration, that's what, 8 ticks x 6 mobs x number of attempts? I'm assuming you're looking at the full report, since the numbers you're mentioning are rather high. I would switch targets when the mob was at about 10%~ to begin DPS on the next channeler. To be quite honest I've never had an issue with dots since I learned to let them tick to their full duration. I think the multi-target nature of this fight is what's accounting for the gap.

</div>This is your problem on this fight.  If you are on channeler killing duty you should trying to keep up dots (SWP and VT) on every channeler and sorceror.  On this fight I hardly find myself needing to cast MB, MF or SWD until we get to Akama.  Just keep tabbing between the mobs and throw SWP and VT on any which don't already have it from you.  By the time you have cycled through all of the mobs, the dots on the early ones will have probably worn off.<br>
<br>
There is simply no reason not to do this.  There is no benefit to focusing one channeler down because they aren't doing any damage and all that matters is getting all (or almost all) of them dead.  Only when there are 3 left does there become a slight benefit to focusing one down first.<br>
<br>
Done right you should be approaching the damage on the rogues (beats me how they manage so much single target damage - I guess those channelers must have pretty much no armor.</div>

</div>First, that talent spec is not typical.  The points in holy are wasted.  Second, Shadow Power, while not amazing, is certainly not marginal either.  It's better than Improved Mind Blast by far.  Third, you should stack your gear for spell damage as much as possible.  I have best in slot or comperable for 75% of my gear, and I'm still only barely over the hit cap.  If you are just starting out, you will give up way too much spell damage in exchange for hit gear.  Only spec out of focus once your ideal gear set naturally puts you well over the hit cap.</div>

		<div id="post_message_536252">Depends if you have the ability to farm Hearts outside of raids (which will be harder to do post-2.3), whether you choose to build in such a way that you can take points out of shadow focus, and whether you've got competition for the Cuffs of Devastation from other classes. <br>
<br>
For these reasons, I chose to take them. At the time, I valued having my own SR crafted early as opposed to having to draw off the guild bank for SR for Mother, so taking the bracers off Akama made more sense in that respect as well. Since we now have surplus hearts, I expect I will be making the nimble thought bracers soon. <br>
<br>
Which is "better" assuming you have access to all three I think is relative to your needs for hit. I think in an ideal world though, where I had all my hit (and talent points) from other gear, I'd choose the nimble thought bracers above all.</div>

</div>Very, very arguable.  Assuming you keep MB on cooldown as much as possible, MB cycle times are 9.5, 9, 8.5, 8, 7.5, and 7 seconds.  Assume a 10% base crit rate.  Call base mindblast damage 1.<br>
<br>
1/9.5*(.9 + .1*1.5) (0,0)<br>
1/7.5*(.9 + .1*1.5) = 0.14 (4,0)<br>
1/9.5*(.78 + .22*1.5) = 0.1168 (0,4)<br>
<br>
<b>If you're keeping MB on cooldown</b>, IMB yields more DPS for the same amount of points, although it also increases MPS burn.  Shadow Power boosts DPM and DPS, but it doesn't boost DPS as much as IMB.<br>
<br>
If you aren't keeping MB on cooldown, of course, IMB really doesn't provide that much benefit to you.</div>

</div>As an above poster said, that talent spec is by far 'typical'.  14/0/47 is the norm, with points shifted around in shadow based on your gear.  If you're in blues/kara, a spec to consider is the basic:<br>
<br>
<a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?talent=bxMhzhZZxGgzMtohtEo" target="_blank">Talent Calculator - World of Warcraft</a><br>
<br>
There are a bunch of heavily debated talent selections, but at that level of gear you shouldn't really be using mindblast a lot (exceptions like curator's evocate ARE there), while shadow power helps you solo (and silence is very useful for heroics/kara trash/soloing).  Once you get familiar with the spec you should be able to see what you use/don't use and move the points in shadow around to suit your playstyle.<br>
<br>
Secondly, no, speccing out of shadow focus is the last thing that you do to increase your DPS.  What you want is as much +shadow as possible to begin with.  Once you hit a decently high level of +shadow (aim for around 900-1k), your mana usage becomes easier to deal with.  Gear for +dmg, and more +dmg.  Use your gem slots to make up for hit rating because when you get raid gear that has innate hit rating you can replace the gems for +dmg, which is simpler than replacing an actual piece of gear.</div>

		<div id="post_message_536347">The build above certainly isn't typical either.  Why would you waste 3 points to get silence?  It is a useless PVE talent, and the two points needed in improved fear make it even more so.  Although nice to have for PVP, if you are primarily rading you are much better off getting imp VE.  <br>
A typical kara build would be:<br>

<br>
For the most part in early Kara/Gruul/Mag ect, if you are looking to maximize spell damage like you should be, crit gear is hard to come by so it is debatable whether or not using mind blast is advantageous.  If you are looking to maximize DPS you need to work MB into your rotation.  SWD also helps however there are many situations where using SWD regularly may not be in your best interest.  The problem with mind blast is that it requires significantly more mana than MF and without it critting very often you are likely to run into mana issues even if you are chain chugging super mana potions.  Sitting there oom wanding is certainly less dps than if you had stuck to mind flaying.  There are ways around this for example you could stack two shadow priests in one group, however most guilds that run with two shadow priests will most likely want to split them up to help more people with mana regen.<br>
<br>
If you need 5 points in shadow focus there are ways to get the typical 4 points in imp MB.  One way would be to lose imp VE and lose 1 point in shadow reach.  Some people say shadow reach is a necessity, however I disagree.  One point is two yards on MF.  This is about the same distance as you would cover by tapping the "W" key.  Although I have two points in it now, I cleared nearly all of BT and Hyjal with only one point in it and never felt gimped at any point in time, with the only exception being phase 4 of Illidan.  Really phase 4 isn't very shadow priest friendly with or without the two points so the point is moot.</div>

And once you someone naturally have 8% hit on your gear while trying to stack max spell damage drop a point from shadow focus and put it back in weaving.

				<div style="font-style:italic">Why is that?<br>
<br>
As to the bracers, I have the Rage Winterchill bracers.  They dropped three weeks in a row and I was third in line, after the mages.  Not really planning to upgrade them.</div>

</div>If you can farm Hearts outside of raids, and your guild allows you to keep them (ie doesn't make you use them to make your own SR) then it seems like the nimble thought bracers are the best choice. <br>
<br>
If you do not have access to Hearts from your own farming, then you either 1) take from the guild bank, slowing down the farm for Mother SR, or 2) take either the akama or rage bracers. <br>
<br>
So when "Depends" I say it in reference to the fact that different guilds have different priorities for the use of their Hearts of Darkness, especially at the point in BT / Hyjal when you're still gearing up for Mother. Obviously if caster bracers drop every week, then your situation is different from a situation where RNG decides that no caster bracers will drop at all for you off any boss.<br>
<br>
edit: Answering the question of why it will be harder: You will no longer be able to 2-man teron trash for easy Hearts drops, limiting your options to actual legitimate clears of said trash, or by soloing the aoe packs pre-mother. This limits access to hearts that you might be able to farm in off-hours, making it more difficult to craft the haste bracers.</div>

		<div id="post_message_537247">Hi, guys!<br>
<br>
I have to say that I have discovered not long ago this site, but I am quite impressed on the precious informations and discussions found here. <br>
<br>
Maybe I wasn't really attentive while reading this thread, though I didn't find any post regarding  the best neck until Black Temple for spriests IMHO - <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30666"><span><span class="purplename">[Ritssyn's Lost Pendant]</span></span></a>. It has a low drop rate from trash in Karazhan, but for the extra spell dmg that gives, I think it worth farming Karazhan from time to time. <br>
<br>
Also, as a 101 fact, in order to maximize the spell dmg, one might consider learning enchanting for the recipe acquired from Keepers of Time (honored reputation required) that allows enchanting enchanter's rings with 12 spell dmg (each).<br>
<br>
Regarding the weapons for spriests, well, I think that the ones from arena rewards are better than the ones that drop in pve. I am looking forward to gather the arena points needed to get the dagger from season 3. I was wondering, for pve raiding, which do you find more useful to equip, dagger with <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29272"><span><span class="purplename">[Orb of the Soul-Eater]</span></span></a> or staff (better stats, lower spell dmg)?</div>

</div>For 2 months I ran Kara for that neck alone.  I actually think it's better than the Reliquary of souls neck.  I'm not sure if it's worth the time, but I'm glad I have it.  It's the only truly good neck in the game for priests.<br>

</div>It depends on what zones you are raiding.  The trash drop mace from Hjyal is excellent, even better than S3 gear.  In general you want 1h + offhand instead of staff.  This is because staves have extra itemization points spent on stamina and int while offhands generally spend stat points on spell damage.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">My point was that at Kara gear levels, you won't even have enough mana to keep Mind Blast on cooldown with 0/5 Improved Mind Blast, so the extra talent points are wasted.  At least +15% crit helps you the few times you do choose to cast Mind Blast.  And it helps Shadow Word: Death too.</div>

</div>At Kara gear levels, you absolutely have enough mana to keep IMB on cooldown if you're willing to chain mana pots on any fight that isn't excessively long (i.e. you can't do it on Alar, you probably can't do it on Morogrim, arguably Malchezaar).  Given that I have a grand total of one piece of gear that can't be obtained by a player at Karazhan levels of gear, I feel quite comfortable making this statement.</div>

		<div id="post_message_538952">I went Shadow the other day for a few Heroics. I skimmed through this thread and it helped ALOT. I used to be the world's worst SPriest, and I did pretty really well (compared to my previous attempts at Shadow).<br>
<br>
I let VT fall off sometimes, but a DoTtimer will help with that, I'd imagine. My problem was mostly that I'd go through the VT-&gt;SWP-&gt;MB-&gt;SWD-&gt;MF, but due to my lag, I generally would have had to cancel MFs to MB as soon as the cooldown was up. (I had 1 point in Imp MB.)<br>
<br>
I figure it's probably not a big deal, as I doubt I'll be raiding as Shadow, but would it generally be a better idea to cancel the MF and do MB as soon as the cooldown's up, or should I just wait for the MF to end? I'm not taking threat into consideration, because my Shadow gear is pretty much the same as my smite gear, so I'm not yet at the point where I'm doing more damage than my tank can handle, where I'd have to throttle back.</div>

		<div id="post_message_538976">It might be more "DPS" to interrupt a Mind Flat for a mind Blast, but it wouldn't be significantly so and possibly not at all depending on how many ticks of flay you got off, but its certainly less efficient, and in a  5 man heroic thats moving along at a good clip a SP is likely to be the only class in  a group going oom regularly. This is because it is already mana intensive to apply DoTs that don't go full duration and with multiple targets to DoT each pull, etc. On the other hand its also a DPS loss to not start a spell and wait for Mind blast to CD. So my general advice would be start the flay and cast the mind blast after the flay. If you find you never cast Mind Blast on cooldown, then spec out of it, and put the points into Shadow Power which will raise the DPS on the Mind Blasts you DO cast, rather than simply cool mind blast down before you're ready to cast it.</div>

</div>Embrace has a 10 second cooldown, so you won't have it up on too many targets, not that you need it up on more than one.  I assume you mean touch?  In general, I would stick to one target.  You get better returns from your touch if you spend more time attacking the same target.  Every time you spend another global cooldown casting another touch or pain, you could have been doing extra damage to a target that already had a touch on it, for more mana regen.  It's also worth noting that too much damage spread around might cause problems for a typical heroic tank, and pulling aggro would be a Very Bad Thing(tm).<br>
<br>
If you ARE dotting a ton of monsters for some reason (for example, during an AoE pack in Hyjal), you generally want to spam 4 to 7 rank 1 or 2 pains and then pick one target and focus it.  The low rank pains are partially for the misery bonus and partially so the tank gets aggro.  In Hyjal, I usually wear my Ashtongue trinket and spam low rank pains until I get the 220 spell damage proc.  At that point, I switch to a target and focus fire it for 15 seconds (ie. until touch wears off).  Then I switch to a new target and repeat, to distribute threat.  Usually I can get a solid 40 seconds of proc time before needing to refresh pains.  It's not as much damage as an AoE class would do, but it's more helpful than anything else I could be doing.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I went Shadow the other day for a few Heroics. I skimmed through this thread and it helped ALOT. I used to be the world's worst SPriest, and I did pretty really well (compared to my previous attempts at Shadow).<br>
<br>
I let VT fall off sometimes, but a DoTtimer will help with that, I'd imagine. My problem was mostly that I'd go through the VT-&gt;SWP-&gt;MB-&gt;SWD-&gt;MF, but due to my lag, I generally would have had to cancel MFs to MB as soon as the cooldown was up. (I had 1 point in Imp MB.)<br>
<br>
I figure it's probably not a big deal, as I doubt I'll be raiding as Shadow, but would it generally be a better idea to cancel the MF and do MB as soon as the cooldown's up, or should I just wait for the MF to end? I'm not taking threat into consideration, because my Shadow gear is pretty much the same as my smite gear, so I'm not yet at the point where I'm doing more damage than my tank can handle, where I'd have to throttle back.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>When you get a DoT timer, a big thing is to think ahead about 3 seconds and figure out what your next spells are going to be.  If it's 3 seconds till VT expires, it 'makes sense' to put a mind flay in there.  But you're better off with MB -&gt; VT so you don't have down time on it.<br>
<br>
Just out of habit, I'd suggest not clipping flays.  I'm sure there's math behind it somewhere else on the site that explains exactly how much mana you're wasting, but clipping flays is just bad habit.<br>
<br>
Also, using VE on heroics (especially on multiple targets) depends heavily on your tank.  If you have the Real Ultimate Paladin Tank, then go for it.  If you've got a warrior who doesn't do anything but spam sunder armor, then maybe VE isn't a great idea.</div>

		<div id="post_message_539452">Cutting a flay is the last on the list of things you should do in the "I have enough mana and want more DPS" scenario. If you're cutting it after the 2nd tick with the same amount of time wasted as you would waste after the 3rd tick (like, if after every MF you lose on average 0.3s due to not wanting to lose the last tick, and if you cut it short you cut it on average ~0.3s after the 2nd tick as well, and *not, say, 0.8s*), it'll be a DPS increase to cut it short when a higher priority ability needs casting.<br>
<br>
What I wonder what's the break even point between waiting for another spell before refreshing SW:P and waiting for SW:P to do the last tick and refresh it before casting anything.<br>
For example (assuming safety of 0.1s after DoTs to not clip and lose nearly 3s worth of DoT) if SW:P gets its last tick in 0.1s (plus latency, of course, or else with &gt;100ms you should cast SW:P anyway), I bet you'd still be better off not casting anything but rather waiting 0.2s and refreshing SW:P for max DPS/DPM.<br>
Another example is if SW:P's last tick is in 1.3s, you should probably cast something else first and only then refresh it rather than wait 1.4s. You lose 0.1s of SW:P but gain 1.4s of casting something else (the last 0.1s would've been there even if you waited for casting SW:P, of course).<br>
Now when you look at middle-ground scenarios, say, 0.7s until SW:P does it last tick, where would the break-even point be? Any model showing this?<br>
Same can be said for VT, except losing it is more of a mana loss and less of a DPS loss compared to SW:P, and you need to add 1.5s to the latency due to casting time.</div>

</div>Yes, I think close 1000 dps is reachable with that gear level, your task should be to get as close as possible to 'optimal' situations, in other words: don't loose time between casts, good spell rotations, don't move too much, etc.<br>
<br>
As an example, on Al'ar, every now and then you have to move from platform to platform; if you do the moving just after you have cast an instant, you are not wasting spellcasting time.</div>

</div>Check if you are clipping off your DoTs or Mind Flay ticks with a WWS or recount parse.  If you refresh those too soon, you'll see a dramatic loss in damage.  Also, you might want to pick up a better trinket than riding crop.  (I'm assuming that's your normal gear because it puts you at 1037 spell damage, close to the 1040 you listed in your post.)  The Crusade deck is ideal, but even the level 62 trinket bought with PvP tokens from Zangarmarsh would be a huge upgrade.<br>

</div>Unfortunately, you leave yourself quite vulnerable in Arena with useless threat reduction talents instead of things like Martyrdom and Improved Mana Burn.  There are plenty of dailies to do, and you could farm your cloth CD's (if you have tailoring) once a week for that 200g.  When you have a free +Hit talent, that leaves more room for stacking +DMG with your gear and enchants.<br>
<br>
To get that Silence, you waste 3 talent points on Improved Psychic Scream &gt; Silence.  That could be better used on Focused Mind, Meditation, Shadow Power.  Feel free to check out my armory link in my profile for a comparison, I'm currently raid geared and spec'd.  If you are too poor to afford respec's, then how will you afford flasks, food and other raid goodies to boost your damage?</div>

		<div id="post_message_541458">So, on the topic of trinkets I've been trying to determine which trinket(s) are best.<br>
<br>
Granted I know that a lot of fights are situational and sometimes you'll want some mana regen, other times you need to use your PvP trinket, and for S&amp;Gs I'll rock the Rocket Launcher (Engineering for the win?)<br>
<br>
Where does the <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32490"><span><span class="purplename">[Ashtongue Talisman of Acumen]</span></span></a> stack up (I just got mine last night)? Has anyone done any theory crafting on the uptime on single targets?<br>
<br>
ShadowPriest.com reports the following info:<br>
<br>
#1? <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33829"><span><span class="purplename">[Hex Shrunken Head]</span></span></a> - Zul'Aman -- 85.39<br>

<br>
The flat +80dmg on the darkmoon card currently stomps all trinkets in the game? The skull is most likely going to our mages &amp; destro locks first, so I'll prolly see one of those right about the time Sunwell is released. If they don't nerf the Hex Head, that's going to be the new top trinket?<br>
<br>
I guess me question / topic for discussion is which trinkets do you use? Why and when?<br>
<br>
I'll start -<br>
<br>
I always wear my <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29370"><span><span class="purplename">[Icon of the Silver Crescent]</span></span></a> except in the Arena. Accompanying that trinket I now wear <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32490"><span><span class="purplename">[Ashtongue Talisman of Acumen]</span></span></a> the majority of the time, and I've been rather happy with it's uptime (but not nearly as ownage as the mage version...) On long fights I still break out the old faithful <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=27922"><span><span class="bluename">[Mark of Defiance]</span></span></a> and the mana returns can be pretty nice (add a shammie and I'm gtg for very, very long fights.) For Archimode / Rage / Arena I use the <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28239"><span><span class="bluename">[Medallion of the Horde]</span></span></a>(and <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29181"><span><span class="purplename">[Timelapse Shard]</span></span></a> + pvp for Arena) I also have the fun little engineering trinkets (I know, shadow priest engineer, wtf?) but no need to link all those.<br>
<br>
How about you'all?</div>

<br>
The card wouldn't do well on trash or add duty (you should rarely be on add duty as spriest anyways) since you'll never get more than 3-4 buffs before the mob is dead.  I'll use it on bosses and longer fights when I know I'll benefit from the stacked 80 damage.

I prefer having one passive trinket and one "on use" one which is macro'd into Shadow Word: Death, because a Mind Blast is usually the next spell followed by either Mind Flay or refreshing of Pain or VT.  <br>
<br>
That Ashtongue trinket looks amazing, granted you keep Pain up 100% of the time, you could see some serious damage boosts when it procs. For Arena I use the <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28234"><span><span class="bluename">[Medallion of the Alliance]</span></span></a> + Quagmirran's Eye until I get the <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29181"><span><span class="purplename">[Timelapse Shard]</span></span></a></div>

</div>Heh. The card's wording is misleading. Before I got mine, I used to think that it stacked on the mob, but in actuality it stacks on YOU. Meaning, you may have only gotten 4-5 casts off on a single mob, but those charges will continue to stack as you switch targets. Odds are that you'll have the maximum number of charges by the time your second target hits the floor.<br>
<br>
I originally had the same intention - Stick with Quag's eye for trash and switch to DMC:C for tougher targets, but after seeing how it actually works, there's really no need to do that.</div>

		<div id="post_message_543515">Why is 2/2 Martyrdom in a 'typical' raiding spec? Its a great talent for pvp (fuck you rogues) and at least somewhat decent for non-heroic 5 mans, but once you step into a raid (Karazhan and above) it becomes a complete waste of points. Extra points in Power Word: Shield (survivability) or Improved Mind Blast (damage) would be vastly superior.<br>
<br>
Martyrdom's function, as clearly stated in the talent description, is to prevent spell push back for 6 seconds <i>after</i> suffering a critical strike. Meaning that what needs to happen for this talent to be worth anything is the following:<br>
<br>
<font color="SeaGreen">Shadow Priest gets critically hit by Mob A.<br>
Shadow Priest gains clear casting<br>
Shadow Priest continues to get hit by Mob A (and/or other mobs) which normally would cause significant spell push back.</font><br>
This is under the assumption of the "best case" for martyrdom, assuming that the critical hit lands on the first attack, which in practice is hardly something that can be depended on. <br>
<br>
In TBC raids mobs are hitting for extreme amounts of damage, and their critical strikes can often time reach up to 5 digits, but consistently land for 6-8k (on cloth with inner fire up). Further, for the inner focus buff to be worth anything, the mob must continue to hit the shadow priest. Lets say the mob has to strike an additional 2 times for there to be a noticeable advantage over a priest with CC buff and a priest without it.<br>
<br>
Further, mob and boss abilities cannot critically strike. Therefore, martyrdom will only be proc'd in a raid by regular melee hits (physical damage) and not AoE/splash damage, which is almost exclusively what is dealt to none tanks in raids. Meaning that the only time that martyrdom will logically be proc'd is during trash clearing when Mobs get loose from the tanks and <b>never</b> on boss fights (save for wipes). Hardly a situation that is worth 2 precious talent points.<br>
<br>
I argue that no shadow priest will consistently live through a critical strike and the additional melee hits to make this talent worth while in the least. Further, said critical strikes are irregular at best, and nearly unseen at worst, for shadow priests in TBC raids.<br>
<br>
Martyrdom is a pvp talent, and doesn't belong in raids.</div>

</div>What do you pick instead?<br>
<br>
3/3 Imp Shield which is completly inneffective for reducing incoming damage?  For raids this has the same arguments against it as your Martyrdom examples.<br>
2/5 Silent Resolve to keep mobs that don't dispel from dispeling your DoTs?<br>
You can't really put more into Mind Blast, as you are taking the T2 Disc talents to get to Meditation / Inner Focus.<br>
<br>
Martyrdom is there because the options are more or less worse, and it at least has marginal value while farming.<br>
<br>
EDIT:<br>
Overall, I view all of T1/T2 disc as filler points.  I don't really care how they are spent, but since I'm taking them anyway I may as well get some benefit.  To me personally, the rare occasion where Martyrdom procs while farming outweigh the benefits of Improved Shield, or going 2/5 in another T1 disc talent.</div>

		<div id="post_message_543607">How is PW:Shield ineffective for incoming damage? Most raid damage is delivered in predictable intervals. So predictable that some people have made mods that use timers and big words in the center of the screen to alert you to when such damage is inbound. Ill agree its not that amazing of a talent for a Shadow Priest (compared to its usefulness to a Holy Priest). But if we all agree that Martyrdom is completely useless, as I illustrated in my original post, and for a least some fights (if not most) a well timed PW:S can keep you alive or help dampen incoming damage on so many fights (Morogrim Earth quake, Hydross Nature thingy, Leothras inner Demons, VR orbs if you are too stupid to run, Iron Maiden Repentance, etc etc.) how can you choose martyrdom over PW:S or other talents?</div>

</div>I meant the talent, Improved Shield is inneffective for incoming damage.  It adds at most 300 more absorbtion if you have roughly 1.1k +heal.  I rate that as completly useless for raiding as well, as you shouldn't ever be needing 300 more life to make or break a fight.  As you said, damage is very predictable.  And the predictably small increase in absorbtion from Improved Shield is predictably insufficient.<br>
<br>
They are both useless for raids, so I evalutate them on how they help me outside raids.  In this case I feel Martyrdom helps me farm materials for raids better than Improved Shield does.  Since that is an out-of-raid benefit that helps prepare for raids, I consider Martyrdom better in a raid spec.</div>

</div>I really agree with this.  I use shields in half of the fights in Hyjal and Black Temple: Azgalor, Archimonde, Naj'entus, Supremus, Shahraz, Council, and Illidan.  For some of them, like Archimonde and Illidan, I proactively use them on other people.  (For example, before a flame blast on Illidan, I'll shield a few people nearby.  They won't have to bandage, so they'll have more DPS time.)  Now 3/3 shield is only 150 more damage than 1/3, so it's really not a make or break thing.  But it absolutely has a bigger impact in a raid situation than martyrdom does.</div>

In addition, we need a specific amount of spellhaste (143, I think - the point where flay becomes 2.75s) for it to become really effective. On paper, this amount of spellhaste may or may not have its advantages over straight damage gear, but in reality, we're 0 for 18 on Greatstaffs.

<br>
I share your ideas about haste: might look good on paper, but it's just a way better stat for direct damage spelll casters. Besides, all calculations around haste are obviously based on ideal situations: static target, always able to keep up your normal cycle. In fights that involve a lot of moving, or generally breaks in casting, straight spelldamage is going to look way better again, anyhow. <br>

		<div id="post_message_546412">I managed to get a Greatstaff last night (4th we've gotten) and had the crafted haste bracers made.  Those two items, coupled with a trash ring has me at 114 haste which reduces my flay down to a 2.8 cast time.<br>
<br>
Having dropped tailoring a while ago in favor of enchanting I currently use <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30050"><span><span class="purplename">[Boots of the Shifting Nightmare]</span></span></a> as opposed to FSW boots.  Rather than take a +24 damage hit by getting the Supremus belt I'm going to grab <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33357"><span><span class="purplename">[Footpads of Madness]</span></span></a> from Zul'Aman which will still get me down to 2.75 at a loss of only +9 damage, some spell hit I don't need, and 200ish health.<br>
<br>
Of course, I am somewhat unique in that I have engineering (pretty much just for the mount at this point) and also have no desire to Arena my way to a Season 3 mace.  On average, if you are a more traditional tailoring/enchanting priest you are probably better off just stacking damage and going with a Season 3 mace and Orb going into Sunwell.  Obviously itemization there will be better but unless it is tuned along the lines of Kael'thas difficulty chances are most top end raid guilds won't be getting that many drops before downing pseudo-Kil'jaeden -- at which point it's academic and all you are doing is farming stuff to level with or... surprise... killing all of those Naxx bosses many of you already killed over a year ago.<br>
<br>
Pre-Tier 6 level you are still better off with FSW or Tier 5.  The badge haste pants aren't worth it nor are the bracers as you can simply just get better crafted ones when your guild has enough Hearts left over after crafting some Mother gear.  Right now +haste for shadow priests is still in the realm of the experimental and unless you're basically in between Illidan and Sunwell now I wouldn't bother shooting for that  140ish rating.</div>

		<div id="post_message_546578"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Haste is pretty reasonable for shadow priests, although certainly it's a lot better for, say, a fire mage.<br>
<br>
Typically a shadowpriest will spend about half their time casting mindflay and mindflay will do about 800 dps on a raid.  Getting enough spell haste to reduce the cast time to 2.75 seconds will therefore increase the dps to 872.  So given that mindflay takes up half of the cast time, thats a 41 dps increase overall for 143 haste rating.  To get a 41dps increase through +damage would require about 70 +damage.  So 2 points of haste are worth about 1 point of damage.<br>
<br>
I don't really know what this fascination with the mystical 2.75 second mindflay is about.  Yes I realise that 2.75s x 2 = 5.5s = cooldown of 5/5 MB.  But outside of theorycraft a rotation is never going to work out this well due to latency, use of /stopcasting not withstanding.  Plus a sequence of MB, MF, MF, MB is pretty rare in practice because very often VT, SWP or SWD need to be cast somewhere in the middle.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Now with latency, I'd be fine with a 5.7 second mind blast cooldown, but 6 seconds is too slow.  There is a tangible increase in DPS from the spec as well.  It's not all kinds of amazing, but it's definitely good.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_546791"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Just a quick and dirty calculation:<br>
<br>
A WWS from Gorefiend shows that out the 294,864 dmg I have done, 110,263 dmg came from MB and SW-D, out of which 50,209 from crits. <br>
Upping the damage from crits by 3% would mean 1506 more damage over that fight (I'm ignoring the 12 crit rating here), in other words a damage increase of 0.5%.<br>
<br>
<br>
The MSD is now going to proc once a minute on average, am I right? So on a 4 minute Teron that is 2 extra mindflays? (ideally) My average tick was 819, so 6x819 means roughly 5k more damage, a 1,6% damage increase.<br>
<br>
Not really scientific proof, but I am guessing the MSD will still be better.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>At first glance I'm guessing you run out of mana from 5/5 improved mind blast and 0/3 meditation, which causes your overall DPS to drop when you run out of mana.  Just do an efficiency cycle for the first 60% of the fight and then blow mind blast every cooldown when you're certain you won't run out of mana before the fight ends.  You should really move 3 points from improved mind blast into meditation.<br>
<br>
The other possibility-- and I can't confirm this without a very detailed look at the WWS combat log-- is that you are refreshing your DoTs before the last tick expires and/or casting a new spell before the third tick of mind flay lands.

</div>I don't run out of mana, but it is a struggle to keep an eye on pot and shadowfiend CDs, that's for sure.<br>
<br>
Ok, so efficiency cycle in my mind is VT, VE, SW:P, and MF.  Is this your thinking as well?<br>
<br>
As far as the DoTs, yes I most certainly could be refreshing them before they are about to expire.  I use Classtimers, but I'm still trying to find something better, or perhaps my rotation could use some work so that it just "works" that I cast VT, for example, in just enough time so that it hits as the previous version expires.<br>
<br>
As far as meditation, my mana regen is pretty poor.  What returns should I expect to see on 3/3 Meditation?<br>

<br>
So assuming 200 or so raid buffed spirit (really low estimate) that would equate to 37.52 mp/5 or almost another BoW. Assuming your Magtheridon fight lasted 10 minutes you would gain another 4502 mana back with 3 talent points (yes, prior to the patch this would have been halved but that's moot at this point).<br>

Basically if you're 11 points deep in Disc you really should get Meditation. It will help your sustained dps in a full rotation.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_549245"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Has anyone noticed an extreme increase in longevity this patch?  I normally have around 250 spirit raid buffed, which is now 56.25 mana while casting, up 28.125 since the patch.  I believe the mana spring totem changes are an extra 8 m/5.  And while we now have a ret paladin, the judgement of wisdom uptime was pretty good even before the patch.<br>
<br>
Yet in Black Temple yesterday, I was literally unable to run out of mana on any fight.  I ended Naj'entus at 60% mana in the full burn cycle, using only a shadow fiend (and that primarily for extra damage).  The mana stability on bosses was better than trash (since I can count on wisdom and curse of shadows), but both seem improved to the point that mana potions are generally a thing of the past.<br>
<br>
So my questions are:<br>
<br>
#1) Has anyone else had similar experiences?  I'd like to pinpoint the primary factor that's removed the mana issues.<br>
<br>
#2) What things can I do to increase my mana burn rate and DPS?  I already have 5/5 Improved Mind Blast, so there are no more DPS talents to take.  Even if 1 spell haste is worth roughly 1 spell damage, I don't think I can get enough spell haste gear to credibly increase the total damage output.  I'm not expecting <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32483" target="_blank">[The Skull of Gul'dan]</a> to incur that much extra mana.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_549296"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->We did ZA yesterday with a ret paladin and I had to try really hard to use mana. Literally doing completely inefficient things like throwing only a SWP up on the eagle spawns on the eagle boss and forgetting to maintain VT on the boss while doing it, etc. Even then I just had to pot normally.<br>
<br>
I guess this frees us up to use destruction potions instead of chain chugging manas?<br>
<br>
Did you guys do Shahraz and Council? Those are the two most mana intensive fights in BT for me. Even before though, on Council trading out a trinket for the Mark of Defiance made mana a non-issue. <br>
<br>
I'm almost certain that a lot of it has to do with the Meditation changes. Seeing almost 100 mp/5 on the character sheet, not even fully raid buffed, was nice. Over the course of a fight that change alone ends up being a full mana pot or two worth of mana. One of our holy priests was saying in guild chat today, that with the healing=spell damage changes, and the new meditation, he was literally farming without drinking at something like 950 + damage and ~270 mp/5.<br>
<br>
I remember something similar happening when I got my 3pc Trans. All of a sudden, mana issues seemed to lessen a lot.<br>
<br>
Having said all that. I like the new changes. <!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_549305"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Cautious clipping of flays is about the only potentially DPS-increasing thing I can think of if you're keeping MB and SWD as close to cooldown as possible.  I think you're basically hitting the cap at the point you're at where nothing is left to improve upon.<br>
<br>
Arguably, you could drop Meditation points to boost Weaving for faster stacking or to pick up Scream/Silence, but I think you're simply running into the point where there's nothing else that *can* be done.<br>
<br>
Other thing to remember is that as you approach infinite mana sustainability, the same amount of MP5 shows longer and longer extension of DPS.  If you're spending 160mp5 and regenning 130mp5, you burn through 30 mp5.  If you add 10mp5 to that, you'll run out of mana in 150% the timespan.  But another 10 mp5 is worth a 200% boost in DPS time, and another 10 beyond that you go infinite.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>No, we stopped before reliquary.  We probably had time to kill Shahraz, but I think they didn't want to clear trash and only have time for one attempt (not that we would have needed much more).  On Council I usually start out in efficiency mode and see how my first shadow fiend goes, and then plan the rest of the fight accordingly, but it's often 3 or 4 mana potions.  I'll see how it goes tonight-- I'm expecting one or two potions with a heavier burn cycle.<br>

		<div id="post_message_549476"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I agree mana management is much easier post patch. My benchmark was on Teron. Pre-patch I would have anywhere from 1/4 - 1/3 mana left as soon as my Icon was off cooldown (using a full burn rotation 3 secs after pull). At that point I would use shadowfiend and usually hit full from that. Post patch, I was at roughly 50% when the Icon came off cooldown. Thats a huge boost. <br>
<br>
One other question, for the Skull of Gul'dan, I've noticed that when I single click it, the fire debuff on my feet stays on the entire time. When I put it in a macro like<br>
<br>
/use The Skull of Gul'dan<br>
/cast [nochanneling:Mind Flay] Mind Flay<br>
<br>
The fire disappears from my feet after about 2 seconds. Maybe this is just vanity, but I'd kinda like to keep the fire there for duration without having to bind it to another key. Anyone know a way I can prevent this macro from canceling the effect?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Edit:<br>
In response to the post about longevity.  I was aware of the meditation buff, and thought it would only be mediocre since we tend to lack spirit, however last night in BT we did Naj-&gt;Mother, and I was amazed at how much mana I had after trash pulls ended, as well as on bosses.  I looked at WWS last week and I potted 12 times throughout the night, on the exact same clear, last night I potted only 2x.  This is a tremendous difference.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Er, I think you misread the math.  MSD came out ahead of CSD, even with MSD's new cooldown, which makes sense, given crit's relatively poor value for spriests.<br>
<br>
The only realistic option I've seen proposed other than MSD is the healing/threat gem for fights where threat capping is an issue, since it works out to 9 +dmg, -2% threat, and has manageable gem reqs.<br>
<br>
I guess the BEM event gem (14 dmg, 5% stun resist, 3 yellow gem req) might be an option, or Swift Starfire (spirit shard gem), but neither is really *good*; the MSD sits nicely for spriests.  It isn't as good as it was, but it's by no means bad.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Has anyone noticed an extreme increase in longevity this patch?  I normally have around 250 spirit raid buffed, which is now 56.25 mana while casting, up 28.125 since the patch.  I believe the mana spring totem changes are an extra 8 m/5.  And while we now have a ret paladin, the judgement of wisdom uptime was pretty good even before the patch.<br>
<br>
Yet in Black Temple yesterday, I was literally unable to run out of mana on any fight.  I ended Naj'entus at 60% mana in the full burn cycle, using only a shadow fiend (and that primarily for extra damage).  The mana stability on bosses was better than trash (since I can count on wisdom and curse of shadows), but both seem improved to the point that mana potions are generally a thing of the past.<br>
<br>
So my questions are:<br>
<br>
#1) Has anyone else had similar experiences?  I'd like to pinpoint the primary factor that's removed the mana issues.<br>
<br>
#2) What things can I do to increase my mana burn rate and DPS?  I already have 5/5 Improved Mind Blast, so there are no more DPS talents to take.  Even if 1 spell haste is worth roughly 1 spell damage, I don't think I can get enough spell haste gear to credibly increase the total damage output.  I'm not expecting <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32483" target="_blank">[The Skull of Gul'dan]</a> to incur that much extra mana.</div>

	</tbody></table>
</div>Even before 2.3, the only fight (post majority Tier 6 gear) I have ever really needed to use a pot on was Council.  I have 5/5 Blast but I don't cast SWeath that often.  As far as what you can do to make use of that mana pool -- nothing really other than the afformentioned use of Destruction pots.  I have a decent amount of them but I won't be using them until Sunwell on a regular basis.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Well it was just a ballpark figure. But since the difference seems pretty big (on a MB/SW-D friendly fight) I'd dare to conclude MSD still wins by a margin yes. (And the chaotic also has tougher requirements for us, 2 blues instead of 1, basically)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Just a quick and dirty calculation:<br>
<br>
A WWS from Gorefiend shows that out the 294,864 dmg I have done, 110,263 dmg came from MB and SW-D, out of which 50,209 from crits. <br>
Upping the damage from crits by 3% would mean 1506 more damage over that fight (I'm ignoring the 12 crit rating here), in other words a damage increase of 0.5%.<br>
<br>
<br>
The MSD is now going to proc once a minute on average, am I right? So on a 4 minute Teron that is 2 extra mindflays? (ideally) My average tick was 819, so 6x819 means roughly 5k more damage, a 1,6% damage increase.<br>
<br>
Not really scientific proof, but I am guessing the MSD will still be better.</div>

	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>There are a lot of factors which will affect the usefulness of the crit gem.  In particular it becomes more useful as crit rating increases, whether 5/5 shadow power is taken, and how much MB/SWD are used.<br>
<br>
Personally I tend to get about 40% of my damage from MB/SWD if I use them on cooldown, so your figures of 37.4% seem pretty reasonable.<br>
<br>
However, looking at your maths I can't really understand where your figure of 1,506 extra damage comes from.<br>
<br>
I'm going to assume that after shadow power your have a crit percentage of 30% (could be wildly off, but thats about what mine is and I don't have any better data).  30% crit rate means 15% extra damage, so on MB/SWD you did 95,881 of normal damage and 14,382 of extra crit damage.<br>
<br>
The extra crit damage is going up from 50% to 53%, which is a 6% increase.  So with the new gem you would get an extra 14,382 x 0.06 = 863 damage.  That's an even less impressive 0.3% damage increase overall unless I'm missing something somewhere.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Yes, MB and SWD on practically every CD (there's no fight where I stick as much to this rotation as Teron, so it seemed the right example), 5/5 Shadow Power, crit 32% on MB and 37% on SWD for this fight.<br>
<br>
Seems I made an error, and yes it only makes it less impressive.<br>
<br>
50,209 damage came from crits. <br>
Crit bonus goes from 1,50 to 1,53. So the damage from spells that have critted goes up: 153/150 = 2%! (The error I made is that ofcourse crits don't do 3% more damage but their <b>bonus</b> damage goes up by 3%)<br>
So, instead of ~1500 it is ~1000 damage. 0,3% damage increase indeed.<br>
<br>
Can anyone tell me if my assumption for MSD is correct? I assumed 1 PPM correctly?And this boils down to half an extra MF a minute, yes? (if you don't waste procs ofcourse)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>VE causes essentially no threat upon application, so if you are going to use it casting it first during that few moments of "let the tank get a head start" is good. VE does, however, increase your threat by a large amount because of the extra healing aggro. I dont know the math off the top of my head, but I recall hearing that VE healing aggro will be up to  40% of your total aggro if all 5 party members  are being healed (over heals cause 0 threat). Use that as a ball park for how much extra threat VE will add. At least for my guild, using VE on a boss fight is the exception, not the usual.</div>

		<div id="post_message_551382">The reason for VE not being in the rotation is that the imporance of it depends on the fight. If you're healing heavily pop it first... If you're having aggro problems never pop it at all (or pop once you stop having aggro problems in place of a MF). In general you should probably put it up when it's down and you're supposed to cast MF by the rotation, although again this is fight-specific if you're needing to do lots of healing VE increases in priority, if you have aggro problems it drops down all the way to "never use it" depending on how severe your aggro problems are and how important the is healing you do.</div>

For example, suppose you have 2 seconds left on your Vampiric Touch but your Mind Blast and Death are on cooldown, and Shadow Word: Pain is already up.  You can either wait half a second and cast touch, you can cast a full mind flay and lose a little mana regen from touch, or you can refresh embrace and start casting your touch when it has .5 seconds left.<br>

Embrace is also a good spell to cast if you have to move but can't cast death or pain for some reason.  It's almost always worth one global cooldown per minute to keep it up though.</div>

		<div id="post_message_552192">With the new heroic haste rewards I am given the decision between haste and spell damage. On the last page someone did some quick-and-dirty math to show that 2 haste is about equal to 1 spell power. Is this for all situations, or just for when you have enough haste to obtain a 2.75 (or better) Mind Flay? Right now I have the Bracers of Havok with a +12 pvp gem in it. This gives my bracers slot 42 spell power. The heroic bracers have only 29 spell power but also have 25 spell haste. A similar situation can be said for my pants slot, I currently have Trial Fire pants (with 3x +9 spell power gems) which have 76 spell damage. The heroic pants have only 54 spell power but have 45 spell haste.<br>
<br>
Assuming that the 2 spell haste = 1 spell power is in fact the case at all times (as far as increasing your overall dps) than these items are very very close to equal. What are you guys doing? Dropping the higher spell power for haste? Or keeping the better spell power till T6 loot that has haste and high +damage?</div>

</div>I would say that the 2 +damage difference is made up for by the stats on the Havok bracers. Regardless, its not a huge difference. Also, the holy grail of bracers would be the epic "of shadow wrath" that has a very small chance of dropping off the beast boss in the basement of karazhan.</div>

		<div id="post_message_552647">I'm hoping someone can provide me with a bit of information about shadow priests in a raid setting.  I'm a warlock in a guild that is 4/6 SSC and 1/4 TK.  I know almost nothing about shadow priests, and how they work, other than their damage boosting buffs are  simply incredible for us locks, and pretty damn good for other casters, as well.  <br>
<br>
1)  Our guild leaders have become fairly reluctant at recruiting / utilizing shadow priests simply because "they die too much".  Would it be somewhat common for shadow priests to be higher on the aggro table than other dps classes, causing their own death?  If extremely high inherent aggro isn't the cause of frequent spriest deaths, is there another reason for them "dying too much"?  Does it just boil down to bad players?  I really want a spriest in our raids for Shadow Weaving and Misery, and I know VE is quite beneficial to other classes as well.  Can anyone provide me with a good counter to the "spriests just die too much" argument.<br>
<br>
2)  Could someone be so kind as to make a summary of all the benefits a shadow priest brings to a raid.  I know I've come across quite a few in this thread, but I'm sure a few are missing.  I'm really hoping I can get enough evidence of their benefits that I can turn the opinions of the leaders around.  Frankly, I'm tired of seeing the melee and hunter classes benefiting so much from Windfury, Curse of Recklessness, Leader of the Pack, Sunder Armor, etc ..., while our casters receive nothing.  There is a false belief that our melee and hunters are simply better than the caster classes.  The fact is they receive numerous buffs to their damage, but the casters can't get Misery, Shadow Weaving, Totem of Wrath, Heroism, and on and on.  Help me show them the light, and get a spriest back in the raid!  Thanks =)</div>

</div><br>
1.  They shouldn't die any more than other classes provided they don't use SWD at inappropriate times.  Other than SWD they don't take any more damage than other classes.<br>
<br>
If they use VE and it is healing a lot then they will pick up a lot of aggro, but with decent tanks its only really Void Reaver and Gurtogg where threat becomes a serious issue.  If VE is doing a lot of healing then they are bringing a big benefit to the raid.<br>
<br>
<br>
2.  The first shadow priest brings an enormous benefit to the raid.  +5% extra damage for every mage on the raid.  +15% extra damage for every warlock on the raid.  The actual benefit depends how many of those classes you bring to the raid, but if you have a reasonably balanced number then thats a huge benefit.<br>
<br>
They regen a lot of mana for everyone in their group.  About as much as if you could chug a super mana potion every minute.  This enables the casters/hunters in their group to do further damage.  Alternatively it allows the healers to last much longer.<br>
<br>
Threat permitting, VE can also be a big help on encounters as it helps to reduce the demands on raid healers.  However, while useful, there aren't a lot of fights where this is exceptionally useful with the probable exception of phase 3 RoS.  Depends how many healers you have I guess, if you are short on healers then this could be a big benefit.<br>
<br>
Above all this, a well played shadow priest can output good dps in their own right.  On a few fights they can even top the dps charts.  Prior to finishing Hyjal/BT they can do even better than most classes because in just tailored gear they can be in the equivalent of T5 already.<br>
<br>
The second shadow priest adds rather smaller, but still very useful benefits - their own dps plus mana regen for another group on the raid.  Adding more than 2 shadow priests has very diminishing returns because it starts to become difficult to find mana dependent groups to usefully add them to.</div>

		<div id="post_message_552722">1) Shadow priests don't die more often. The threat we generate is not higher than any other class by itself. If agro is the reason they are dying, drop VE and pulling agro is really the tanks fault. VE is not the reason you want a shadow priest anyway. Also the average mage will have less hp than the average spriest.<br>
If your raid leaders experience is that they die too often it boils down to bad players.<br>
<br>
2) Reason number one is mana. It will allow your mages to go all out on damage. And once you bring more, you can also get your hunters, warlocks and last but not least your healers some extra mana to play with. And with some extra I mean up to 25000 mana (thats 10 mana potions) to each group member on fights like A'lar. Thats really non trivial amounts, and not comparable with judgement of wisdom, mana spring, blessing of wisdom, not even close. <br>
<br>
We give a 5% damage boost to all casters damage through misery. Thats more than flasks will give you. Shadow damage for your warlocks is increased with 10% through shadow weaving. Thats like an extra CoS on a target.<br>
<br>
We provide group healing over time that can be really helpful on some fights. But it's certainly not the number one reason to get a spriest. The threat generated through it can be a problem. Nevertheless there are fights where a spriest can mean your healers dont have to pay attention to that group.<br>
<br>
On trash, spriests can provide quite decent emergency healing. On several occasions I've saved trash pulls with dropping out of shadowform and popping a few heals.<br>
<br>
In short, your raid leaders are really short sighted if they think spriests will not give benefit to their ranged casters. Most TBC fights still favor ranged dps over melee.</div>

Mana management really shouldn't be capping shadow priest damage if mana potions and shadowfiend are managed right, unless a freak accident eats the shadowfiend. There are some benefits to having two shadow priests together, such as being able to use destro pots and possibly having more leeway for SWD on certain fights due to double VE, but overall the effect on dps shouldn't be terribly dramatic.</div>

The benefit to doubling up is that you wind up with two spriests fully capable of tab-dotting every single add they see or running a full burn MB/SWD rotation essentially indefinitely.  If your healers aren't running into mana issues, and you have 3+ spriests (we occasionally bring 4, and usually bring 3 simply because 2 of them are officers, I'm high attendance, and the 4th does occasionally like to raid) doubling up isn't a terrible idea, at least during T5.</div>

With 3/5 avatar and the meditation changes in 2.3 my full burn longevity has risen dramatically, not enough to get off the potion crack-pipe, but by a decent margin.  Unfortunately, we never double shadows in one group, one will be in with the two holy priests and the other with the mages and elemental shaman. As set up the spriests call mana battery or melter due to the gains from the shaman.</div>

		<div id="post_message_556197">Having two spriests in the same group is only beneficial for the two spriests.  The rest of the group will have an overflow of mana (other than maybe a CoH priest going spam crazy).  Spreading out the spriests to more mana users results in more people having extra mana to go all out with.  The spriests will be the only ones in their groups that heavily use potions instead of a whole group of people who weren't grouped with the stacked spriests.  Besides, there is a ready supply of mana potions in T5 instances, so the spriests don't even have to worry about paying for too many potions.  Back when I was doing T5 content, other mana users actively mailed me Nethergon Energy that they pick up in raids or the 5 mans since they didn't need them for themselves :P<br>
<br>
For T6 instances, I agree that the only encounter where I heavily mana potion is Illidari Council.  Illidan has plenty of breaks for my mana to regen naturally and every other fight is short enough where I can get by with 1-2 mana potions should my shadow fiend fail on me or if it's Kaz'rogal.</div>

Not to mention that while it may make it a bit easier on the rest of the DPS gear for gear a shadow priest really isn't going to comepete with an arcane mage.  <br>

Shadow Priests merely matured a bit faster then the other classes do to higher base/easier i.e. farmed/crafted tier 5 gear.  In T5 the other casters well surpass us on overall output.<br>

Overstacking Spriests for more mana is gimping raid DPS when there are far to many DPS checks in the encounters.</div>

		<div id="post_message_556265">Again, we regularly raid with 3-4 spriests.  If we only have 2, we don't double them.  We also don't currently have an elemental shaman at all, and typically run with 1 shaman, who goes to melee.  So doubling is a function of raid makeup as much as anything else, and ours is a little bit off from the norm.<br>
<br>
Our group makeups generally make the most sense with a double spriest except on fights that tax healer mana.  I'm not saying it's *optimal* overall, but given the choice between 2spriest/3mage, spriest/mage/3lock, and a healer group with no spriest, vs. spriest/3mage/healer, spriest/mage/3lock, spriest/healers, we generally choose the former, unless healers are running out of mana in the first place.  It's the same as the old "How many healers?" question - sure, the DPS gain may be minimal from doing it, but if you have *enough* healing, why would you give your healers an spriest vs. giving your DPS more mana to burn?<br>
<br>
I'm not saying it's something to aim for, but neither is it necessarily a bad idea in all circumstances, particularly in T5 where the fights tend more towards length.  There is a benefit associated, and it depends on the raid makeup whether that benefit is worth the tradeoff of losing an spriest in another group.</div>

		<div id="post_message_556395">I still don't see why you would double up shadow priests when you have 3. Do you hate hunters and/or bring excessive melee (compared to what I see others doing) to your raids?<br>
I even doubt it's really worth it to bring a 4th shadow priest over another class considering the raid DPS he brings VS the raid DPS you lose by not bringing him. Any less than 3 shadow priests though and you have groups without one, meaning when you run with 2 you're losing healing power (which is very manageable on probably most fights but just doesn't seem to be optimal), or if you really need the healing power you're losing a lot of DPS it's just not worth running with 2 when you can run with 3.<br>
<br>
If you can convince me otherwise that there is reason to raid with either more or less than 3 shadowpriests (except attendance issues of course, but we all know it's not optimal to have attendance issues ) I would love to hear it. Preferably backed up by "this gives X DPS while that gives Y DPS". Only reasoning I could come up with is fights where healing is easy enough for then to not need a shadow priest, yet another shadow priest wouldn't be able to let you run with 1 less healer.</div>

</div>We bring what we have.  I've never said anything other than "based on our raid comp, we sometimes double up, and it does have some benefits, albeit not incredible ones."  Maybe you should pay attention to what I say rather than just responding to the first line?<br>
<br>
Yes, we hate hunters (not really, we tend to only have 3 mages and bring a hunter into the 2s/2m group rather than 2s/3m) and bring lots of melee.  We tend to only have one pure caster group.  For OUR RAID COMP doubling up makes sense.  It doesn't for everyone, or even for us all the time.  However, it absolutely has a measurable benefit.  Up to the raid leader, raid group, and raid comp whether that benefit is sufficient to justify it over giving the healers an spriest.</div>

</div>Tick isn't a global timer, it's derived from DoT application time.  Since a DoT doesn't tick until 3 seconds after it's been applied, reapplying before the last tick actually loses several seconds of DPS time.  Pretend it's a 9s dot, to minimize the amount of typing I have to do, ticks every 3s.<br>
<br>
Apply at T=0.<br>
<br>
Tick at 3, 6, 9.  Right?<br>
<br>
Let's say you reapply at T=8.9, though.  Now your ticks go:<br>
<br>
3,6,11.9,14.9,17.9.<br>

</div>Clipping the last tick results in lost dot damage.  The only way you can ensure you dont lose that damage is to make sure you re-apply your dots once they fade.  Losing that extra tick here and there adds up to some odd few thousand damage, and is a loss in damage and mana.  Also, generally when you are reapplying dots too early, you tend to lose out on dot uptime, not that your dots aren't there, but you apply in between ticks, you just lost 1.5 seconds of dot ticking time, and then you have to wait an extra couple seconds for it to start ticking again.

</div>Put another way, suppose you could effectively refresh Vampiric Touch at 15.2 seconds (just after it wears off) or 14.8 seconds (just before it wears off).  In the first case, you get 100% damage in 15/15.2 percent of the time, so you get 98.7% of the DoT's effectiveness.  If you refresh at 14.8 seconds, you get four out of five ticks every 14.8 seconds, which is 80% * 15/14.8 effectiveness, or 81.8% effectiveness.  Refreshing just a bit too early makes the DoT lose almost 20% of its potential damage.<br>

Incidentally, this is the same reason clipping your last Mind Flay tick is horrible.  Remember that Mind Flay is also a DoT.</div>

</div>This is true assuming your next cast is also mind flay, otherwise it is dpm loss and not a dps loss. Canceling a flay imediately after a tick for something more dps effective like MB (to max the cooldown) can be a dps gain. <br>
<br>
The previous points made were true only because they involved clipping by applying the same DoT. <br>
<br>
If we had some sort of special DoT on a cooldown that did more damage, but could not have SW:P up while it was up, it would likely be a dps gain to clip SW:P for it. Again, paying a dpm loss for it.</div>

</div>Even if you're recasting Mind Flay it's bad.  Suppose at 2.8 seconds you cast a second mind flay.  The timeline looks like this:<br>
<br>
0.0: Start first Mind Flay (0 ticks)<br>
1.0: Tick (1)<br>
2.0: Tick (2)<br>
2.8: Start second Mind Flay<br>
3.8: Tick (3)<br>
4.8: Tick (4)<br>
5.8: Tick (5), end of Mind Flay<br>
<br>
So you still get 5 ticks in 5.8 seconds.  If you refreshed at 3.2 seconds instead of 2.8, you'd have 6 ticks in 6.2 seconds, which is clearly superior DPS.</div>

The problem is clipping MF at the right time.  Clipping it at 1.01 seconds to cast something better is a good thing.  Clipping it at 1.99 seconds is a bad thing.<br>
<br>
Personally, with my relatively high latency (200-300) it is pretty much a lottery whether I clip it just before a tick or just after one.  So I tend to just leave MF to run for the full duration..</div>

I'm usually at 165ms, but alas, blizzard's "upgrade" in dual processor performance has had a VERY negative effect on my frame rate, most noticable on Vashj/Kael...or on the waves in Hyjal.  Basically anytime I really need it to perform.<br>

As a result my DPS has dropped off nearly 100 since 2.3 due to clipping and all the guess work on my cast times.</div>

</div>Usually, if I'm going to clip, it'll be a small delay (~0.5secs, dunno, it's a feeling ) after the MF GCD is over, which sometimes matches my MB/SW: D cooldown finishing... In this situation is easy to gain dps and end up with a few more MBs than you would otherwise...</div>

		<div id="post_message_559934">Regarding clipping MF too early accidently.<br>
<br>
I'm using quartz and I'm affraid I too often accidently clip mind flays at the end of their cast. While I'm chanelling mind flay I press down the key of my next spell, and release the key (remove my finger from it) when quartz shows I'm entering the red area of the bar.<br>
<br>
I'm wondering if everyone is doing this? Pressing the key of their next spell during mind flay channel, but not releasing it untill they want to cast. And I'm wondering if this is clipping my mind flay too often (ie. not getting the final tick) accidently?<br>
<br>
I've done some tests on Dr. Boom. And if I release the key before the red area I won't get the final tick. So.. how does everyone else handle that? Only mindflay has this mechanic where you can interupt it during the channel by just pressing another spell. I play at sub 6fps usually, and the exact timing is quite tricky.</div>

		<div id="post_message_560184">I wrote up a post on my raiding community forum comparing Shadoweave robe and shoulders, Hood of Hexing and Trousers of the Astromancer with Avatar, it might be useful here too.<br>
<br>
Avatar has more stamina, int, spirit and spellhit.<br>
<br>
* More stamina is great, but it's easy to get to the point where you have enough for everyday use, especially with honor and arena gear that's also very good for spellpower. Upgrading just <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=24250"><span><span class="bluename">[Bracers of Havok]</span></span></a> to <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33883"><span><span class="purplename">[Vindicator's Dreadweave Cuffs]</span></span></a> is a larger stamina increase. Or even swapping in  I-killed-Prince-Malchezar-and-all-I-got-was-this-lousy-trinket or an Of Stamina green for the few special fights.<br>
<br>
* Int is utterly insignificant for any class in a raid setting. Base regen gives about 50 mp5 and VT from a very conservative 600 dps gives 150 mp5 = 200mp5 over an 8 minute fight = 19200 mana regenerated, more than twice your entire mana pool. (And that's not counting raid buffs, potions or the shadowfiend.)<br>
<br>
* Spirit is a lot better with the new Meditation, and very useful for grinding.<br>
<br>
* An average set of Karazhan/Spellstrikeish epics will already have spellhit coming out your ears, and it only gets worse as you get better gear, to the point of going 3/5 or 4/5 Shadow Focus in Black Temple simply because there's so much of it.<br>
<br>
* The metagem slot basically means Mystical Skyfire Diamond, which gives you an extra half a mind flay every minute or so after the nerf. If mind flay does 2000 damage, that's an extra 2000/2/60= 17 dps. I have no idea how shadowpriest.com gets it to count for 44 dps. I think (but I'm not quite sure) that 2 spellpower adds about 1 dps when everything is counted in.<br>
<br>
* Assuming the set bonuses don't have a hidden cooldown, the t5 2-piece is about 150/((1/(34/75))*100/6)*5= 20 mp5 and the 4-piece about 100/((34/75)*7.5)= 29 spellpower. The Shadoweave 3-piece isn't really worth anything in a raid. (34/75 is 34 spells cast in 75 seconds, taken from shadowpriest.com's spellpower to mp5 topic.)<br>

		<div id="post_message_560246">The internal cooldown is 45 seconds and your assumption of 2000 damage on a MF is a bit low for the t5 damage level with full raid buffs. It should be closer to 2300 or 2400 average (assuming some ISB and proper debuffing). Still not quite 44 as shadowpriest.com lists but higher than 17. Although I haven't accounted for any downtime waiting for the proc either so this is more like perfect conditions.<br>

		<div id="post_message_560253">This is interesting to hear your thoughts (woob and hope) on dot refreshing. Typically I try to start casting my VT with 1.5 seconds left on the duration, going for the perfect refresh at the exact moment it falls off (which I'm sure in reality doesnt happen). But with SW:P I would usually try and refresh the dot when I am moving, figuring that I might as well cast the instant cast now when its otherwise wasted down time. Would it be better to not do this? Does the advantage of using a GCD when moving get undone by the loss of a tick? What about when I go a full SW:P time without needing to move, should I refresh after the last dot ticks? Usually I just refresh it when its close to falling off, but rarely do I let it fall off all the way. If I understand the above math correctly, and I think that I do, its better to let the last tick go off than to refresh too early.</div>

		<div id="post_message_560259">If you're talking about fights like Alar, I usually wait to move and do it <i>while</i> I'm casting instants. Not the other way around. Of course, there's always the times when you have to move <i>right now</i>. I still stick to the plan of not refreshing dots until they expire unless I know I'm going to be away from my target for the rest of the duration of the buff, which doesn't happen very often at all in my experience. Gruul comes to mind, sometimes I'll refresh VT before a ground slam there if it's about to tic out. Refreshing dots before they expire also kills DPM, but since the meditation change this really isn't such an issue anymore.<br>

Sort of an aside, but, does anyone know of a mod that tracks the internal CD of MSD? That would be helpful in perfecting the use of focus procs.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">The internal cooldown is 45 seconds and your assumption of 2000 damage on a MF is a bit low for the t5 damage level with full raid buffs. It should be closer to 2300 or 2400 average (assuming some ISB and proper debuffing). Still not quite 44 as shadowpriest.com lists but higher than 17. Although I haven't accounted for any downtime waiting for the proc either so this is more like perfect conditions.<br>

</div>15% proc chance per cast at 34 casts in 75 seconds is roughly a proc every 15 seconds on average, plus the 45 second cooldown. Assuming you get to haste a mind flay every time with no badly timed procs. The best way to count the effective ppm (ie. procs that actually help you) would be a WWS parse I guess, or running a mod that records it for every combat. Unfortunately I don't have an MSD to check it myself.<br>

With 2400 damage mind flays it becomes 40 spellpower.</div>

* Assuming the set bonuses don't have a hidden cooldown, the t5 2-piece is about 150/((1/(34/75))*100/6)*5= 20 mp5 and the 4-piece about 100/((34/75)*7.5)= 29 spellpower. The Shadoweave 3-piece isn't really worth anything in a raid. (34/75 is 34 spells cast in 75 seconds, taken from shadowpriest.com's spellpower to mp5 topic.)<br>

</div>Fantastic post by the way...<br>
<br>
I regards to hidden CD's on T5 I don't believe there is one. <br>
<br>
* Relentlessness (2 peice proc) goes off for me every other spell in my rotation at times, some times much slower, but "feels" very similar to set PPM proc along the lines of Crusader or SoC.<br>
<br>
*Sadist (4 piece) has a rediculous proc rate, I see it on my combat text a LOT.  Of course I only go to 4 peice Avatar last night so this is primarily on dalies and one trip through AV.<br>
<br>
I'll post a WWS as soon as I can find one wear I'm employing both set bonuses.</div>

If you have a second rank 1 SW:P ticking on some other mob (hello Illidari Council) the 100 dmg buff will be up more or less constantly. If you use power auras or some other mod to track it, it's fun to watch how often it really does proc compared to every other proc in the game. Thus, benefit you get from it can scale.

		<div id="post_message_561989">I did a little more checking into the 2 spellpower = 1 dps ratio. Casting only VT/SW:P/Flay on Dr. Boom for one minute (I'd test with Blast and SW: D too, but then I run out of mana too soon), I can do 330 dps with 0 spellpower, and 850 dps with 1278 spellpower. Assuming 15% more damage in a raid setting from CoS and ISB that's 1278/(850*1.15-330*1.15) = 2.1 spellpower/dps.<br>
<br>
The Absolution 2-piece bonus lets you cast 8 SW:Ps in 216 seconds instead of 9. So you save 575 mana and have time for another half a Mind Flay, making the bonus worth about 575/216*5 = 13 mp5 and 2500/2/216*2.1 = 12 spellpower.<br>
<br>
The Absolution 4-piece bonus essentially gets you a free Mind Blast for every 10 you cast, so assuming you cast it every 7.5 seconds for 2500 average damage, it's worth about 2500/75*2.1 = 70 spellpower.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">This is interesting to hear your thoughts (woob and hope) on dot refreshing. Typically I try to start casting my VT with 1.5 seconds left on the duration, going for the perfect refresh at the exact moment it falls off (which I'm sure in reality doesnt happen). But with SW:P I would usually try and refresh the dot when I am moving, figuring that I might as well cast the instant cast now when its otherwise wasted down time. Would it be better to not do this? Does the advantage of using a GCD when moving get undone by the loss of a tick?</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>It depends on how much time is left on Shadow Word Pain and how soon after the last damage tick you refresh it.  In my experience, a Pain tick is roughly 85% the damage of a Mind Flay tick.  So mindflay has M DPS and Shadow Word Pain ticks deal .85 * M damage.  Now the best case is that you save a full GCD (if you refresh just as pain falls off) and the worst case is no GCD saved (if you refresh right after you cast pain).  So the proportion of extra GCDs is equal to the percent of shadow word pain that has expired.  If you refresh it when the time is half gone, you gain half a GCD.<br>
<br>
One GCD is as valuable as half a mindflay, or 1.5 M damage.  However, you lose damage when you delay the next pain tick.  If you cast pain right as the next tick was about to occur, you'll lose a full .85 * M damage.  So the formula for damage gained from refreshing pain should be:<br>
<br>
T = Time that current pain has been up when you refresh the next<br>
P = Duration of Shadow word Pain (24 unless you have the T6 set bonus)<br>
Damage gained =  M * 1.5 * T / P<br>
Damage lost = M * .85 * (T mod 3)<br>
Net Damage = M * (1.5 * T / P - .8 * (T mod 3))<br>
<br>
So you want to refresh when the net damage is positive.  That function is roughly:<br>
<br>
2 * T/P - (T mod 3)<br>
<br>
Anyone have a program that can graph this function so we can see exactly when it's worth doing this?</div>

</div>Can you increase the sampling resolution on the program that created the graph?  It should show a sharp (vertical) rise at each multiple of three, and then a flat linear decrease to the next multiple of three.  In other words, it's a piecewise linear function.<br>
<br>
At any rate, the general conclusion seems to be that you should refresh a shadow word pain early only if:<br>
<br>
A) You can't cast anything else (ie. you are moving)<br>
B) You refresh it right AFTER a tick occurred (ie. it time remaining is just below a multiple of 3)<br>
C) The time remaining on the current pain is less than 12 seconds.<br>
<br>
So you should only refresh it at 11.5, 8.5, 5.5, or 2.5 seconds remaining.  Maybe 14.5 if you trust your reflexes and have a lot of mana to spare.</div>

Amazing break down hope, I am going to try and tuck those numbers into the back of my brain, see how it helps on my dps. I wonder if it would be possible to modify my DoT timer to give a pulse (or some visual signal) X amount of time before these "ideal refresh numbers". Like have it pulse at 12, 9, 6, and 3. Thats probably well beyond whats necessary as it shouldnt be too hard to start 'sensing' when these ideal times are up.

				<div style="font-style:italic">Regarding clipping MF too early accidently.<br>
<br>
I'm using quartz and I'm affraid I too often accidently clip mind flays at the end of their cast. While I'm chanelling mind flay I press down the key of my next spell, and release the key (remove my finger from it) when quartz shows I'm entering the red area of the bar.<br>
<br>
I'm wondering if everyone is doing this? Pressing the key of their next spell during mind flay channel, but not releasing it untill they want to cast. And I'm wondering if this is clipping my mind flay too often (ie. not getting the final tick) accidently?<br>
<br>
I've done some tests on Dr. Boom. And if I release the key before the red area I won't get the final tick. So.. how does everyone else handle that? Only mindflay has this mechanic where you can interupt it during the channel by just pressing another spell. I play at sub 6fps usually, and the exact timing is quite tricky.</div>

</div>Why would you use rank1 SW:P on council when you can run a full dot cycle on the paladin and mage? The highest dps a shadow priest can do is to chaincast dots and refresh them right as they fall off on ~4 targets. Adding targets up to 4 to dot is always a dps increase as long as you aren't losing dps to movement. Maybe your positioning is screwy and doesn't allow it, but it's definitely higher damage.<br>
<br>
If you have 2 targets available, your highest dps priority queue is 1. VT+SW:P on both targets 2. MB/Death 3. Flay. If your mana cannot sustain a full mb/death rotation with dots on 2 mobs, start cutting them out of the rotation first. For council, I maintain dots on the mage as top priority. The paladin gets dragged around the room and is sometimes a good 15-20 yard run to get into casting range. If he's too far, I just continue with a normal damage cycle on the mage. It is NOT an increase in dps to waste 2-3 seconds running to get dots on a 2nd target, especially if his resist aura is up. If he's in range  (I keep him set as my focus target) I refresh dots right as they fall. If the mage gains the magic immunity shield, I run over to the paladin and run a single target dps cycle on him. However, if his resistance aura is up I will refresh dots and flay only; it makes sense to use your higher dpm/lower dps cycle when there is a high chance of resists or partial resists (unless, of course, you are not mana limited). I don't use death except very rarely to save a weaving stack falling due to the risk of burst damage on that fight and the fact that my mana cannot sustain a full mb/death rotation. <br>
<br>
Make sure to park your shadowfiend on the paladin right after he's moved out of a consecrate and right after his resist aura has dropped. If you end up running out of mana due to a shadowfiend death or incorrectly judging how many MB's you could afford to cast, switch to dots+flay only on the mage, or on the paladin when his resist aura is down.<br>

We run 2 shadow priests (sometimes 3) and we both do the same rotations, so I don't have to worry about weaving falling off too often because our dots get staggered and it gets refreshed just from that. If you're the only shadow priest, you'll need to land a mb/death/flay on your secondary dps target between roughly every other VT refresh to keep weaving up (VT's duration = weaving duration, and SW:P refreshes the stack between roughly every other VT, so you have to keep it up between the VT's that SW:P does not have a refresh).</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Why would you use rank1 SW:P on council when you can run a full dot cycle on the paladin and mage? The highest dps a shadow priest can do is to chaincast dots and refresh them right as they fall off on ~4 targets. Adding targets up to 4 to dot is always a dps increase as long as you aren't losing dps to movement. Maybe your positioning is screwy and doesn't allow it, but it's definitely higher damage.</div>

</div>Honestly I haven't tried running multiple dots. I mean the shadowfiend out of consecrate thing is obvious, you have to do it or it dies. The single target when magic immunized thing is also obvious. Limiting shadow word death, again common sense at this point. <br>
<br>
On omen, I have mages turned off for threat mostly to simplify what I'm looking at during the fight, but I imagine threat wouldn't really be a problem, I guess it might depend how much attention the your spell stealing mage is paying attention to DPSing the mage mob vs. keeping a gcd for spell steal, and possibly (as we do) using him for interrupts on malande. Assuming my threat on that target isn't an issue, maintaining dots on 2 targets wouldn't be all that difficult. I suppose as long as VT is up on both targets, even though a multiple dot rotation is more draining on my mana, it doesn't cut mana return to my party, again as you mention as long as you maintain weaving on both targets. <br>
<br>
Regarding positioning, since the mage stays put the entire fight (and relatively, for us the paladin and mage are closest compared to malande and veras) the question for positioning to keep dots up vs. full damage rotations is going to depend on where the paladin is being dragged at any given moment. Since we run 2 SP's, keeping weaving up on both targets if we do the same thing could be pretty easy. <br>
<br>
I'm gonna try it. I am usually not all that mana limited in this fight, as the SP's carry the healer groups and druids toss us innervates. The only risk I see associated with this is that increasing the number of dot targets carries risks of losing mana if you can't keep VT up 100% of the time, or if weaving falls off because a blizzard landed in between you and your target. Furthermore, the more running around I do the harder it gets to keep everyone properly spaced for the flamestrike/blizzard aoe, but that probably won't be a problem either. thanks for the tip.</div>

		<div id="post_message_566723">Apologies if this is slightly away from the main sway of the thread but I have a quick question.<br>
<br>
How effectively can shadow priests dps? Our guild is currently farming Kara and about to start Gruul. Sadly our lone shadow priests damage is the lowests in the team.  however a good friend of mine says that this is not the way it should be.<br>
<br>
With kara gear, what dps should a good spriest (ie one who knows the class, and rotations required) achieve at Kara/Gruul level? Currently we're seeing Hunter&gt;Warlock&gt;Rogue&gt;Mage&gt;Boomkin&gt;Spriest<br>
<br>
I've been pointing various guildies to these forums over the last couple of weeks, and our Rogue and Mages have definately improved. Hopefully I'll be able to persuade the spriest the benefits of spending a night reading up on these forums instead of levelling alts :-)</div>

When I was at the Kara gear level, the ordering was Spriest / Warlock / Rogue &gt; Hunter &gt; Warrior / Mage.  Tailoring and badges gives shadow priests access to gear that they will use the moment they hit 70 until they kill Illidan (and sometimes after).  If they aren't at least in the top 5 for DPS at the T4 instance level, they are definitely doing something wrong.  It's probably pretty easy to identify too-- just look over their gear and talents and the compare to the information in the root post in this thread.</div>

This person you are referring to actually has +967 <b>shadow</b> damage and should be able to pump out really good dps though that +crit trinket needs to go out the window fast. <br>
<br>
His spec is pretty half-arsed, no thread reduction as you said, only 3/5 Shadow Focus, only 2/5 Misery. Improved Psychic Scream and Silence while situationally useful are not raid dps talents and should be put into the above talents as soon as possible.<br>
<br>
If the player is a receptive fellow willing to improve his abilities looking in this thread would be a good start, for your WWS you should look at his dot uptime as it should be as high as possible to max his dps.</div>

</div>Here are three consecutive WWS logs from my PTR tests on Dr. Boom:<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302201854/http://wowwebstats.com/ie6ljdlcaauqm" target="_blank">[WWS - PTR Dr. Boom #1 - 1319 DPS]</a> <br>

<br>
If you armory me you can see the majority of my gear is comprised of tailoring craftables, BoJ rewards, and heroic drops, I only have two pieces of gear from Karazhan and no gear from any higher instances. My gloves are from Kara but they could be upgraded with the new 2.3 badge reward gloves. So in reality you could do this with one Kara epic and the rest of your gear being made up of tailoring craftables and heroic rewards.<br>
<br>
Context of the results:<br>
-Buffs: <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=22866"><span><span class="whitename">[Flask of Pure Death]</span></span></a>, <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=22522"><span><span class="whitename">[Superior Wizard Oil]</span></span></a>, <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=27657"><span><span class="whitename">[Blackened Basilisk]</span></span></a><br>
-Lock Debuffs: 13% Curse of Shadows, Improved Shadow Bolt (Lock had ~18% crit), and of course the standard SW + Misery<br>
-Latency: 160ms average<br>
<br>
Each test went for about approximately 2 minutes 40 seconds, this may sound short but even with <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=22832"><span><span class="whitename">[Super Mana Potion]</span></span></a> and <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=12662"><span><span class="greenname">[Demonic Rune]</span></span></a> thats the longest I can last since the boom bots don't play nicely with shadowfiends. I decided to only use my <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=25619"><span><span class="greenname">[Glowing Crystal Insignia]</span></span></a> once for each attempt because using it twice in a 2 min 40 sec fight would skew the data.<br>
<br>
The figures from my spreadsheet predicted that I could do 1328 dps, in my trials some attempts were slightly higher and some were slightly lower due to varying crit rates for both my warlock (Improved Shadow Bolt) and myself. The average dps from my three attempts was EXACTLY the expected value of 1328. While it was only three attempts I believe the spreadsheet to be over 99% accurate. If you plug in the expected dps if I had full raid buffs (Blessing of Kings, Divine Spirit, Arcane Intellect, Mark of the Wild, Wrath of Air) my expected DPS would have been 1400. My gear is not perfect for the Gruul level however, <br>

<br>
The above upgrades would bump the spreadsheet's expected dps up to 1477.<br>
<br>
So to sum things up with average Gruul gear you can get up to 1400 dps, and with perfect Gruul level gear you can get up to 1477 dps. This was all for my average latency of 160ms, of course you will do better with less, even with the new casting system latency is slowing down my mind flay, would be nice if Blizz applied the new casting system rules to channeled spells with nochanneling macros.<br>

</div>Taking into account that this is on a stationary target that isn't fighting back. In Gruul you have a lot of downtime due to moving around for Shatters and the AoE Silence. If your spriest is smart he'll make sure his dots are ticking for the duration of the silence but with ~900 shadow damage I'd be expecting (at best guess; been a while) about 600-700dps.<br>
<br>
At Kara level though, he can easily attain more than 900 shadow damage, with crafted gear and easily obtained heroic rewards 1000-1100 isn't asking much and if he has a steady arena team and has access to the S2/S3 weapons, expect 1200 shadow damage. As was said, shadow priests have the luxury of being able to gear themselves almost 100% outside of raids and keep this gear to well into T6 content and still be viable.<br>

</div>Just noticed this statement, my alts levelling guild has just started Kara and I've been going along in addition to raiding on my main. Their raiding shadow priest has 753 shadow damage and zero hit rating and he's pulling around 650-700 dps with 13% CoS and about 60% Imp Shadow Bolt uptime. He's using a cookie-cutter spec and and showing up a T5-geared elemental shaman without breaking a sweat. Your guy could really improve with some feedback if he/she is serious about their performance.</div>

		<div id="post_message_567248">Nice theorycraft on Dr. Boom, but I find it far off from realistic levels. I'm in almost full T6, and if I make such numbers (1300 dps+) then I'm a happy man.<br>
<br>
In my Kara-days, I think I would be able to dish out about 750-800 dps on more or less stationary fights.<br>
400 dps for the level of gear you mention is very, very underwhelming though, although I'm reluctant to judge "over the space of 2-3 hours". Is this about the same dps he pulls out on bossfights? Then replace him asap.</div>

		<div id="post_message_567262">Well tbh, a shadowpriest that puts even the tinyest effort into his gear (gets hitcapped and doesn't bother with crit) on Karazhan lvl, should be able to outdps pretty much anyone, aslong as he knows what he's doing.<br>
<br>
The problem I usually came across when starting to raid Kara was threatproblems. We used to have a pretty mediocre tank with us, and his TPS was way below my swp+vt+flay rotations, so my dps suffered due to not being able to go all out. Later on we got a new tank, who was just a vicious aggromachine, and I could do things I never imagined possible for a spriest, which also showed in the whole raids dps, as well as in my personal dps going from about 500 to 750.<br>
Then I was browsing some random chineese goldfarming forums, and I came across a topic called Lien Chen Dao Bu or something like it, which explained the relevance of +spellhit for a shadowpriest. I never really bothered with spellhit, I did enough dps as it was. I thought. I at the moment had frozen shadoweave, random blues, spellstrike legs and not much more. I thought to myself I'd better test the +spellhit, so I gathered mats for spellstrike hat, got the enchant, aswell as +spellhit on gloves (attumen still to this day didn't drop his bloody gloves), so I capped out at 76 and went for Karazhan, once again.<br>

It was amazing. My dps was higher than ever before, mobs gave me less partials, less full resists and the tank who I thought was AMAZINGLY GRAET!!! now wasn't much of a challenge to an allout dps cycle (vt-&gt;mb-&gt;swp-&gt;death-&gt;flay-&gt;mb). I experimented along with this once we downed Prince Malchezaar and I got my dagger. We pretty much cleared all of Karazhan in a matter of months, due to lacking ppl because of the whipes we had on Aran (flamewreath = do NOT move, wish we had -dkp and everyone would be back at the stoneage).<br>
<br>
Anyhow, after Karazhan we had another challenge, Gruul. We took down Gruul from start to end in 1 week. Magtheridon took us 2 weeks. At this point I totally skipped the thought of going for any pieces of t4, due to its lack of overall pwnage. A month later we took our first scrawly steps into SSC, had a great time and downed Hydross on the 4:th night there, proceeding to Lurker, who went down in notime. Morogrim was a problem to us, but after I specced prot on my pally, got some gear and spammed holy lights on murlocs, he went down in notime. Leo was a problem, but followed the others onto our pricewall. Karathress was a pain in the butt due to alot of new players and some old bad ones, but we got him down in a week. Vashj went on our second night.<br>
<br>
Now we have cleared SSC + TK, and are going to take our first steps into Hyjal and onwards to BT. I am currently holding #1 to #3 on the dmg done / dps charts in every raid I attend, with very few deaths to overaggro and very little overall messing up. If you look at my gear you realize that it COULD be alot better, but Shadowpriests are made in a way, which allows us to wreak so much havoc with so little gear, and returning mana to the party is just an amazing ability. We rarely raid with less than 2 shadowpriests, sometimes even 3.<br>
<br>
I had a point to make when I started writing this, but now I lost it.<br>
<br>
Max spellhit, max spelldmg is the way to go, in that order. Lack of spellhit and missing ticks / casts is what messes up your dps.</div>

400 dps for the level of gear you mention is very, very underwhelming though, although I'm reluctant to judge "over the space of 2-3 hours". Is this about the same dps he pulls out on bossfights? Then replace him asap.</div>

</div>It's been a long time since Kara for me, but I recall when I was in tailoring gear back then with tanks that had no T5 gear that I was genuinely threat-capped, so my DPS was certainly nowhere near what it could have been.<br>
<br>
To add some more to the topic though, real-world experience with T6 gear for Akiba &amp; I have seen us max out in the low 1400s for DPS at Teron.  For me, that's with 1335 spell damage unbuffed, and typically I might have an oil and food on.  I'm also running around 15 FPS in raids, so that might be cutting into my DPS slightly, especially whenever there's a slight hiccup or two.  Also, my spec isn't completely min-maxed -- so I run with 1/5 Imp MB, instead of 4.  With all of that said, I certainly could see the top end for spriests being over 1500 DPS on a few fights where you can just sit and blast away.</div>

</div>Going 5/5 Improved Mindblast and using Shadow Word: Death every cool down that you can safely do so (common sense: if you are below 50% health or taking damage dont cast a spell that can cause nearly 4k damage to yourself on a big crit) you can really stretch your dps. Rage Winterchill is probably the best bench mark fight I have done since starting T6 (havent been to terron yet) and I was able to crank out 1231 dps, according to WWS. It plays largly on how well you can prioritize your spells. When to refresh dots, when to cast your cool downs, how to use your trinkets, etc. Gear is a big part of it, certainly, but I am sporting only ~1240 shadow damage self buffed (crusader trinket stacks), and 1231 is a damn solid dps for the gear I have.<br>

That was before I got my T6 gloves (got them tonight). So at the time I was wearing 4 Karazhan Drops, 2 Craftables (Eng gogs &amp; bracers of havok), 3 Heroic rewards (OH, trinket and wand), 3 SSC drops, no T6, no T5, 1/5 T4 (shoulders, ick).<br>

To be fair I did have a shaman, but still, I think thats pretty good for my gear!</div>

</div>If everyone is performing well, you should no longer be at the top DPS when you leave Karazahn.  Rogue damage scales better than casters do, so you'll lose to them on almost every fight.  And for caster DPS...  When a mage gets better gear, the mage deals more damage.  When a shadow priest gets better gear, the priest AND all his group members deal more damage.  Eventually you reach a point where it's just impossible to break into the top 5 except on a very specialized fight like Illidan.  But that's okay-- other people beating you on damage meters is still a sign you are playing well.<br>
<br>
There are even a few fights like Reliquary of souls where I won't even be in the top 10 (since I almost never get both Concentration Aura and Earth Shield for phase 2).  Damage meters aren't the proper way to measure your raid's effectiveness.  Measure it by the duration of the boss fights.</div>

</div>Yeah I do relatively better in SSSC/TK than I do in our Kara Badge farming runs. <br>
<br>
Midnight - Threat capped (that anti-hit curse).<br>
Moroes Trash - your AoE is gonna be on top.<br>
Moroes - Threat capped (don't want to pass the second guy on threat)<br>
Maiden - If your melee can stay in through repentance they'll do good.<br>
Opera - SPriest should do good here, anyone that can keep ahead of the BBW will do good.<br>
Nightbane - Spriest should do competitive DPS<br>
Curator - Spriest should be on curator full time for VE/VT returns, should top damage.<br>
Aran - Melee do incredibly well here<br>
Illhoof - Your SoC warlock should be at 2K DPS<br>
Netherspite - Whoever figures out the beams is going to do well. <br>
Prince - Stepping in and out of MF range during Enfeeble reduces DPS, staying alive will let any DPS top meters.</div>

		<div id="post_message_567793">There's a lot of fights I'm around 10 or below.  I may do 1400 DPS at Teron, but that's still usually bringing up the rear.  That's more a statement on how good everyone else, not a statement at how bad spriest DPS is.  Just to pull out some numbers from our last clears of BT/Hyjal and where I was at:<br>
<br>
Rage:  1283 DPS (14th)<br>
Anetheron:  1168 DPS (13th)<br>
Kaz'Rogal:  1308 DPS (12th)<br>
Azgalor:  948 DPS (8th)<br>
Archimonde:  924 DPS (9th)<br>
<br>
Hyjal is a bit subjective since it depends how often you get targetted with stuff at Rage, Anetheron, Azgalor, and run around like a chicken with its head cut off at Archimonde.  <br>
<br>
HWL Naj:  1122 DPS (13th)  -- got spined 3 times, but even 1300 DPS would have only moved me up one slot<br>
Supremus:  871 DPS (8th)<br>
Akama:  Doesn't count<br>
Teron:  1288 DPS (12th)<br>
Reliquary:  Doesn't parse well, sort of irrelevant anyways<br>
Gurtogg:  931 DPS (12th)  -- definitely threat capped here due to VE, so have to hold back<br>
Shahraz:  765 DPS (11th) -- FA'ed 3 times.<br>
Council:  1001 DPS (7th)<br>
Illidan:  1026 DPS (4th)<br>
<br>
Numbers are fairly representative of where you should expect to place in T6 content with a competent group.  My personal numbers were a bit down this week but where I place is usually similiar.  Generally I'm toward the bottom with the affliction lock.   That's also quite a reasonable place to be, considering what we both bring to the table.   I also play a bit cautiously on fights like Archimonde and Supremus phase 2, Akiba usually beats me there + he gets the elemental shaman.</div>

</div>We were actually discussing this in our guild the other day. Really DPS often doesn't represent how well your raid is doing. Also, DPS is skewed by the length of the fight. If you kill Teron in 3 minutes, that means for 1/4 of the fight you had heroism, and you probably used your on-use trinket, that lasts 20 seconds, twice for a total uptime of about the same (22%). Whereas, a guild that kills Teron in 6 minutes had heroism for 1/8 of the fight and used their on-use trinkets 3 times for a 16% uptime. Using cooldowns (Combustion, etc.) follows the same pattern. I'm at work so I can't really plot this trend at the moment but I'm almost sure it's an exponential relationship.<br>
<br>
Better DPS from 1 (any) player in the raid &gt; Shorter boss fights &gt; Better DPS from the whole raid &gt; More DPS for you on paper</div>

Well as expected. The gain has a peak right after SW:P ticked, and will lower to a minimum in the middle between ticks. Refresing at 21 seconds makes you gain 1.75. With 24 seconds it gives you the full 2.</div>

</div>I can't agree with this graph (assuming the vertical scale is M)<br>
<br>
The most you can possibly gain is 1.5M.  That's when you refresh SWP after it has worn off.<br>
<br>
The most you can possibly lose is 0.6625M.  That's when you refresh SWP after 2.99 seconds (you lose 0.85M but gain 3/24 of a GCD).<br>
<br>
Refreshing after 15 seconds should provide a benefit no matter when the refresh takes places because the benefit of gaining 15/24 of a GCD exceeds the maximum loss of a SWP tick.  I think this will probably even be the case if refreshing after 12 seconds.<br>
<br>
Finally, as tedv pointed out, the graph should be stepped so that every 3 seconds the benefit jumps up and then declines in a linear fashion over 3 seconds.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Nice theorycraft on Dr. Boom, but I find it far off from realistic levels. I'm in almost full T6, and if I make such numbers (1300 dps+) then I'm a happy man.<br>
<br>
In my Kara-days, I think I would be able to dish out about 750-800 dps on more or less stationary fights.<br>
400 dps for the level of gear you mention is very, very underwhelming though, although I'm reluctant to judge "over the space of 2-3 hours". Is this about the same dps he pulls out on bossfights? Then replace him asap.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Well the theorycraft estimates are just that, estimates. However, I don't think they are that far off considering the actual base results where I used my own gear were confirmed with WWS results. The only difference between Dr. Boom and a real boss, aside from the obvious lack of boss abilities, is the hit cap and the partial resist rate. I am hit capped anyways as are most shadow priests, so for most cases the only change is the partial resist rate. It doesn't sound that unreasonable to me that obtaining full raid buffs and a shaman coupled with higher ISB uptime (due to a higher warlock:shadow priest ratio, and higher crit rates from destruction specced locks, whereas I only had a UA affliction lock) could make up for losses from partial resists and more. Furthermore my Dr. Boom results weren't perfect, on one I clipped 2 MF ticks and on another I clipped 1 MF tick.<br>
<br>
Definitely going to agree with you on dumping any shadow priest at the 400 dps range, with reasonable gear all you don't have to much more than keep up DOTs to do 400 dps.<br>

</div>For all of T5 content using VE was the exception, not the rule. Its usually just wasted threat as your paultry VE heals wont be enough to make a difference, so you are basically just bleeding threat from your wounded party members until a healer takes care of them (which will heal them up to 100% weather you gave them 500 of VE healing or not). In T6 I am finding that there are more situations where VE is needed (Najentus) and that the extra threat makes no difference as the tank has enough as is (Having VE up allows me to SW:D at least slightly more often). <br>
<br>
A shadow priest is brought to the raid for mana. *VE is just a bonus. If you are ever having to slow down dps because of VE, its time to stop casting it.<br>

Some fights are the exception (Morogrim, Negentus, etc).</div>

</div>I wouldn't be concerned. I'm at 1177 shadow dmg and I generally manage anywhere between 600-800 dps on VR. Dodging orbs isn't the problem, its the threat reduction on the tanks, I occasionally find myself just sitting there with dots up, flaying can even be too much at times. Not sure if this is the "norm" or not but the only classes that really pull 1000dps+ on VR are locks and mages, both of which have effective threat management abilities.</div>

I found that when VR got really deep on farm it became worse and worse. You start getting dps warriors as tanks, people arent trying as hard, class comp isnt ideal, etc etc. If you have 4 prot tanks/feral druids that know their shit, have a good TPS group for them (mostly a shaman, ideally an enhancement shaman) and the tanks are trying their hardest, I never ran into threat issues with VR. Of course back then I was doing less damage and was sporting the -2% threat meta gem, but even still, I think I cracked 1k dps on him a time or two (usually around 900 though). The fights so easy that it really doesnt matter, which is why tanks start to let their hair down and not try so hard in the first place.</div>

</div>There is NO such thing as a "rotation."  There is no simple pattern you can follow because the cooldowns are all different and line up at different times, not to mention the difficulties of having to move and throwing the most carefully planned "cycle" off.  Shadow priests cannot say "Yeah, I do a 8 fireball/1 scorch rotation" or "Yeah, with 2 piece tier 4 I can run a 1 SnD/5 Rupture cycle."  It doesn't work like that, like I said in the original post.  The sooner you get the idea of a set rotation out of your head, the sooner your DPS will improve.<br>
<br>
It's a priority system, which is similar to the list you made, but the priority system does not describe a specific order of casting spells.  Rather, it states which spell should be cast when multiple spells conflict.</div>

</div>Well, the thing is that it wasn't a function of smoothing my damage output out.  Remember back to Broodlord, where mages and locks had a hard threat cap as a function of how often the tank took knockback and their TPS, there was a number you could not go above without being guaranteed to pull aggro at some point.<br>
<br>
In my old guild, that hard threat cap number was such that I'd typically spend 30% of the fight doing nothing.  Whether I spent that 30% at the end, the beginning, in the middle, or spread out, fundamentally I could only do so much damage before I hit that cap.<br>
<br>
VR is assumed as a 25% knockback.  Assume a tank with 1000 TPS.  If he takes a knockback every N seconds, his minimum threat ceiling is found when the threat generated in N seconds (N*1000, in this case) equals 33% of the minimum threat ceiling.  For example, if N = 10, then the tank generates 10000 threat between knockbacks and keeps 7500 of it, plus 75% of prior threat.  So:<br>
<br>
K = .75*K + 7500<br>
.25K = 7500<br>
K = 30000<br>
<br>
A more general form: T = TPS, N = knockback interval, K = minimum threat ceiling.<br>
<br>
K = .75*(K + T*N)<br>
.25*K = .75*T*N<br>
K = 3*T*N<br>
<br>

Rather than hit that 300k at 30%, it let me hit it closer to 0%   It also smooths out the rate of return on VT for my group, and overall it's smoother for me because when I first hit VR I was in full tailoring epics and the tanks were in T4 at best.

		<div id="post_message_570947">I took a different approach to my threat cap on VR. I did wear some pvp gear, but only enough to make it easy to survive anything he could throw at me (full pvp gear was a couple thousand more hp than I really needed). Instead, I used my extra mana to drop form and spam mendings on the tanks after healing priests' mendings had bounced off. <br>
<br>
It helped tank healing and gave an extra 1-1.5k healing threat to the tank every 15-20 sec, and I was able to remain threat capped even with the loss of 15% damage (and consequently 15% less mana returned, severely reducing my personal efficiency; obviously the physical mitigation wasn't missed). I'd even toss out an occasional renew if mana allowed or try to save people who sucked at dodging orbs. The playstyle was very similar to how I used to do archimonde before the fear ward cooldown nerf and due to the nature of the fight. Honestly I find that hybrid style more fun than what I do on most fights. Of course, I would have rather stayed holy, but got pigeonholed into going shadow.</div>

</div>Haha wow, we are almost long lost brothers in this regard.  I alwyas look forward to Archimonde since I get to play holy on him, and being a healer on Archimonde is a ton of fun.<br>

I JUST started going Holy for Arenas as well, and it is a lot more fun than shadow, shadow really feels quite mindless in PvP.</div>

		<div id="post_message_571161">I've noticed that if your raid doesn't have terrible players, on both broodlord and void reaver the boss will be dead before the cap is reached. However as the fight progresses they will generate threat slower and slower, but in my experience not get very close to the cap. This means that unless you're going close to the enrage timer with a low number of tanks and/or tanks that are bad at generating threat, you can always do more damage as the fight progresses. Not your max DPS, but it's easier to be doing damage close to your threat limitations when you have high spell damage than when you have low spell damage. As for resting the first 2 minutes rather than the last 2, you're risking estimating the threat wrong and ending up not catching up to the tanks by the end if you wait the first 2 minutes. Not to mention once your party have all casted a spell, their mana isn't full and they'll be benefiting from VT.<br>
On a last note, VR is so easy healing-wise (being in a SP group I still get heals probably because the healers are bored and want to heal something), just drop VE to ease your threat. Of course it won't matter if people don't ever get hit by orbs, but let's be realistic - people will get hit by orbs occasionally, and you shouldn't be the one healing the, - you have healers that don't have much else to heal that can cover that without having threat issues.<br>
<br>
As for VE on other fights it really depends what your raid needs more - healing or DPS, as VE will limit your DPS and your group's DPS via lower mana returns, but will make healers have an easier time. Much more complicated than the VR example where there is little point to using VE.</div>

		<div id="post_message_571659">Sorry if this question is out of place, I looked in the PvP section and I couldn't find a discussion on Shadow PvP specs.<br>
<br>
Anyway, my guild has Illidan on farm, and we're down to raiding 3 nights a week, leaving me with a lot of spare PvP time on my hands. I'm looking to swap over to a full pvp/arena build similar to what can be found here:<br>
<br>
<a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?talent=bxrMzhMZZVMGtMtRhtVo" target="_blank">Talent Calculator - World of Warcraft</a><br>
<br>
17/0/44<br>
<br>
Knowing the importance of Imp Mana Burn in the arena, my questions lean more toward which other talents to get in the Disc tree.<br>
<br>
Silent Resolve - Is it at all worth 5 points for 20% dispell protection? Does this effect my dots?<br>
Meditation - I know this is huge in a raiding environment, but it seems like I'm forever out of mana in the Arena's anyway. Worth having?<br>
Absolution - offensive dispell is pretty huge, and mass dispell is giant as well, but are the points here worth anything?<br>
<br>
I'm still working on finding a 5v5 that can roll together frequently, but my 3v3 with lock &amp; druid seems like it may be good once we learn to play together. My 2v2 is for giggles mostly, however a disc/holy priest and I seems to do quite well (2x Mana burn + PS + PI is pretty leathal)<br>
<br>
Again sorry if this post is out of place &amp; thanks!</div>

		<div id="post_message_571759">It seems like running with a druid give you some endurance in the fight, but keep in mind shadow pvp is very limited to your ability to be able to last.  That being said meditation doesn't give you much extra longevity, and personally I've found that teams more appropriately oriented for shadowpriests are burst groups (my 3's was a warlock/spriest/rogue).  Generally the rate-my-spec tends to be frowned upon, but you made some pretty solid choices on your talents.  I really am not sure if the low mp5 bonus will help you on your 3's unless the matches go on very long, and it may simply be more beneficial to have the 20% dot dispel resist component in your arsenal.  <br>
<br>
If you want a more longevity oriented spec, going 20/0/41 and picking up 3/3 imp shield, keep 3/3 meditation, dumping silent resolve, and getting 2/5 mental agility and 2/2 imp mana burn is also pretty impressive.  You can eat the bursts as you will no doubt find yourself being a focus, and though you only get 2/5 mb and lose the minor burst loss from 5/5, having a healer behind you will allow you and the warlock to find the "right" moment to coordinate your burst.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">For all of T5 content using VE was the exception, not the rule. Its usually just wasted threat as your paultry VE heals wont be enough to make a difference, so you are basically just bleeding threat from your wounded party members until a healer takes care of them (which will heal them up to 100% weather you gave them 500 of VE healing or not). In T6 I am finding that there are more situations where VE is needed (Najentus) and that the extra threat makes no difference as the tank has enough as is (Having VE up allows me to SW at least slightly more often). <br>
<br>
A shadow priest is brought to the raid for mana. *VE is just a bonus. If you are ever having to slow down dps because of VE, its time to stop casting it.<br>

Not arguing this point.  However, at 1100 shadow with imp VE (when it's was 30%, not now) paltry isn't exactly the tern I would have used.  It's was around 190 a tick with a chance to crit, so 1400+ VE hits on MBs wasn't unheard of.<br>
<br>
Also, this was before SA was nerfed and I was usually grouped with three pallies under the condition that I have VE up for even more mana.<br>

Being a 1 minute debuff it certainly becomes an issue on, say Gruul when you are still learning the encounter and being required to keep up all debuffs.</div>

</div>Paladins used to be able to use Divine Shield, Divine Protection, and BoP one right after the other, warriors in AQ40 and Naxx gear could do 1k+ dps, and Shadow Priests used to get 45% reduction to threat. Point is there are a lot of things that used to be in the game that arent because they were broken. VE Healing when the heals could crit and it was 30% was a different story than 25% (or 15% as most SPs have till deep enough in T6 gear to drop so many points from shadow focus) and no crits. My vamp watch still has my highest VE heal as 3,000 something from a MB crit + VE crit on Curator. Its unlikely to beaten.</div>

Going back to an older topic, I've been waiting and waiting for an optimal WWS of me at Teron to post, and I finally have one, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302184155/http://wowwebstats.com/i6c2awhcjoqik?m&amp;s=5855-6048" target="_blank">Teron Gorefiend</a> , with a cavaet:  I did get Shadowed at about 15%, and had to start running as a result with 20 seconds left on the debuff.  Teron died just before I did though.  So I lost about 20 seconds of optimal DPS time, but this is easy enough to simulate.<br>
<br>
In 20 seconds I would be able to cast, worst case with regards to dot timers:<br>
<br>
2 VT<br>
1 SWP<br>
1 VE<br>
<br>
That's 6 seconds of the 20 taken up in GCDs.<br>
<br>
Worst case with regards to cooldowns (I had 4/5 imb MB at the time for 6 sec CD)<br>
3 MBs<br>
2 SWDs<br>
<br>
That's 7.5 more seconds, or 13.5 seconds total.  Throw in .5 sec for latency and that would leave 6 seconds to fill up with 2 Mind Flays.  <br>
<br>
I reapplied my dots before I had to run with 20 seconds left, so I lost 2 ticks of VT.  That's 755(avg tick)*2=1510 more damage<br>
3 extra MBs=3315 (average of hits/crits) * 3 = 9945 more damage<br>
2 extra SWDs = 2441 (average) * 2 = 4882 more damage<br>
2 extra flays = 858 (average) * 6 = 5148 more damage<br>
<br>
Summing it up would give 21485 extra damage.  I'll just call it 20k, since things don't always go perfect.   Adding 20k to my total damage gives me 243211+20000=263211 in 184 sec, or 1430 DPS.   That jives fairly close to what I was seeing on Recount before I had to run.  <br>
<br>
Note:  I was using an Elixir of Major Shadow Power, Superior Wizard Oil, and Blackened Basilisk food for this for a grand total of +1455 shadow damage.  I had an Elemental Shaman in my group for WoA/ToW/Lust.  I did get Curse of Shadows for this fight.</div>

		<div id="post_message_574803">Alright, this is my first post here on Elitists, and while I am a dedicated raider, im not really up to speed on all this theorycrafting, so I figured I would ask the experts, or atleast the guys who knows more about it then me, aka You.<br>
<br>
With spellhaste being normalised at 15.7 for both casters and melee after patch 2.3, I have been looking into changing things up a bit. While I have been reading about the MB rotation discussions (To have 1/5 imp or 4/5 or 5/5) I have still not been able to find a post adequatly explaining the synergy between spellhaste, MF and MB rotations.<br>
<br>
aka, at what Spellhaste rating will you be able to squeese in that extra MF between MB cooldowns.<br>
<br>
Ex. With (?) spellhaste, I can lower my imp MB to 3/5 and squeese in an additional MF in the rotation between DoT applications.<br>
<br>
As I said, im a bit new to theorycrafting, but I think the above example illustrates my problem. <br>
For now, I have 4/5 imp MB, and 0 spellhaste. (Have some gear, but not using it yet) and I usually run my dots, then MB, MF, MF, MB in my rotation. Pretty standard for most bossfights anyway.</div>

Actually this isn't necessarily true.  When my guild first started voidreaver I was the only shadow priest and I was aware that I needed to slow down my damage to ensure that I survived until the end (or very near the end of the fight).<br>
<br>
You are correct that I will do the same damage whether I start fast or slow (and indeed if I start slow I risk not being able to catch up later).  However, my contribution is more than just my damage - if I die early then shadow weaving and misery will drop off the mob and cut the damage that our mages/warlocks can do.<br>
<br>
The same applies for any class applying debuffs to the mob such as scorch or curse of XXX (although less of an issue as curses last 5 minutes).  It will also apply to shamans who drop totems.</div>

</div>You should not be removing points from improved mind blast to fit additional MFs in. Here are some numbers on 390 spell haste rating; this is the maximum amount of spell haste currently available in game on cloth, including healing pieces.<br>
<br>
(100/(100+(390/15.8)))*3.0=2.406s MFs.<br>
Even at 850 average MF ticks (which you wouldn't get with this much haste gear):<br>
(850*3)/2.406=1059 dps from MF.<br>
<br>
Assuming 2400 average MBs, which is on the low end:<br>
2400/1.5=1600 dps from MB.<br>
<br>
This math is intentionally skewed in favor of MF, and it is still not even close to MBs dps. Bottom line: Take 5/5 IMB and use it on cooldown. Anything less is suboptimal dps.<br>
<br>
<br>
About spellhaste and MB/MF/MF/MB subcycles:<br>
With zero latency and perfect chaincasts, you would need 198 spellhaste to fit 2x MFs directly in between a 5/5 IMB cycle. In reality, you end up needing slightly higher than that to compensate for lag.<br>
<br>
However, the short version of it is that spell haste is not an all or nothing deal- incremental gains will result in visible dps increases. As you gain spell haste you will start to notice your % usage breakdowns on WWS skewing more towards MF; this is the result of being able to fit in additional ticks in between small amounts of movement or other odd breaks in your casting sequence that would have been wasted otherwise. It helps to visualize it if you think of MF not as a channeled spell with 3 ticks, but as 3 separate spells each with one tick. As each tick gets shorter, you can start to fit them in during times on fights where you would otherwise have had to wait to cast.<br>

Dedmonwaukeen's simulated haste analysis is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304073307/http://wiki.shadowpriest.com/index.php?title=SimulationCraft/ShadowPriests_and_Haste" target="_blank">here</a>. Take note that dedmon's sim uses raw +shadow values far lower than you will actually have raid buffed in T6/haste gear, which results in his realized haste dps increases being lower than in-game. This is however a good illustration of how haste is not strictly a step function.</div>

		<div id="post_message_575382">Here is some math I did regarding spell haste: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080304073307/http://elitistjerks.com/552613-post106.html" target="_blank">http://elitistjerks.com/552613-post106.html</a><br>
<br>
I believe the estimates are fairly accurate.  They are within 10% of the simulation that was linked, even if the spell damage numbers aren't correct.  (For example, the .5 * Mind Flay DPS * Haste% says the first simulation will get a 45 DPS increase from 200 haste rating.  In reality it went up by 50 DPS.)<br>
<br>
Given that your unhasted mind flays will average at most 900 DPS even with the best of gear, 1% haste will be at most 4.5 DPS.  That means you gain .288 DPS per haste rating.  Since 1 spell damage is around .45 DPS, the absolute best case is 1 spell haste rating = .64 spell damage.  In practice, .6 is more realistic.  I'll note that this contradicts my previous claims on spell haste, but I won't bore you with the details of how my old math was wrong.<br>
<br>
At any rate, spell haste is not useless and it's far better than spell crit, but you should never try to stack it over spell damage.  The only spell haste item in the game which is best in slot is the trash drop caster ring from Black Temple (and that's just best for your second ring).  Still, some items get close.  The bracers from Rage Winterchill are only 2.5 spell damage better than Nimble Thought, and only if you get a Crimson Spinel for them.</div>

<br>
The only answer I've been able to come up with is that it helps compensate for lag slightly.  You get a tenth of a second to mess up on and not have to start that VT later.  Has anyone come up with a practical answer?  Yes, getting a 2.75 flay means you can get and consistently use 5/5 Improved MB...but what about a 2.94?  2.8?  2.87?  Etc.</div>

Even if we did, there's still the 1% resists that would throw it off eventually. If you factor in any movement time, which is required on almost every fight in the game, the "perfect rotation" doesn't exist. Therefore, a quicker Mind Flay cast will eventually lead to increased DPS somewhere. Whether it is finishing that MF .12 seconds early so you can move, or recast a dot after you've moved then flayed, etc. You are right though, there isn't much room for increased DPS there by stacking a minimal amount of haste.</div>

		<div id="post_message_575813">You guys are assuming the tanks reach their max threat during the fight, which honestly doesn't seem to really happen with decent tanks in a 10 minute fight. Yeah as time passes they will generate aggro slower and slower, however they will theoretically never reach the cap, and practically they will not even get to the point where they're "close to the cap".<br>
<br>
If you want to verify this theoretically you could assume each tank's TPS, cooldown on knockback and threat reduction, and figure out the threat your current tank would be holding at any given point in time. Even back on broodlord tanks seemed to not reach that point with a raid that doesn't slack (low threat generation + fight takes too long because some people simply don't deal damage).</div>

		<div id="post_message_575833">So last night I got my T6 helm and was enchanting/gemming I started thinking about what gem to use.  Here's what I came up with.<br>
<br>
<a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32196"><span><span class="purplename">[Runed Crimson Spinel]</span></span></a> = 12 SP<br>
<a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32218"><span><span class="purplename">[Potent Pyrestone]</span></span></a> = 6 SP<br>
<a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32215"><span><span class="purplename">[Glowing Shadowsong Amethyst]</span></span></a> = 6 SP<br>
<br>
In order to satisfy<br>
<br>
<a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=25897"><span><span class="bluename">[Bracing Earthstorm Diamond]</span></span></a> = 9 SP<br>
<a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32641"><span><span class="bluename">[Imbued Unstable Diamond]</span></span></a> = 12 SP<br>
<a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28557"><span><span class="bluename">[Swift Starfire Diamond]</span></span></a> = 14 SP<br>
<br>
Meaning that for each combination if you are going for max Spell Damage you end up with:<br>
<br>
<br>
<a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=25897"><span><span class="bluename">[Bracing Earthstorm Diamond]</span></span></a> + <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32218"><span><span class="purplename">[Potent Pyrestone]</span></span></a> - <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32196"><span><span class="purplename">[Runed Crimson Spinel]</span></span></a> = +3 SP<br>
<a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32641"><span><span class="bluename">[Imbued Unstable Diamond]</span></span></a> + 3x<a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32218"><span><span class="purplename">[Potent Pyrestone]</span></span></a> - 3x<a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32196"><span><span class="purplename">[Runed Crimson Spinel]</span></span></a> = -4 SP<br>
<a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28557"><span><span class="bluename">[Swift Starfire Diamond]</span></span></a> + 2x<a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32218"><span><span class="purplename">[Potent Pyrestone]</span></span></a> - 2x<a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32196"><span><span class="purplename">[Runed Crimson Spinel]</span></span></a> = 0 SP<br>
<br>
Meaning that baring any Socket bonus you could pick up from using <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32218"><span><span class="purplename">[Potent Pyrestone]</span></span></a> along the way you would be best off using <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=25897"><span><span class="bluename">[Bracing Earthstorm Diamond]</span></span></a> for a meta gem.<br>
<br>
So in my case since I'm using the <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=31061"><span><span class="purplename">[Handguards of Absolution]</span></span></a> and can get the set bonus and satisfy the meta socket bonus of each of those it's best to use the <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=25897"><span><span class="bluename">[Bracing Earthstorm Diamond]</span></span></a>, that is unless the combo of:<br>
<br>
<a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=25893"><span><span class="bluename">[Mystical Skyfire Diamond]</span></span></a> + <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32215"><span><span class="purplename">[Glowing Shadowsong Amethyst]</span></span></a> = -6 SP<br>
<br>
Is worth more then it.  Or to sum it up , is <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=25893"><span><span class="bluename">[Mystical Skyfire Diamond]</span></span></a> &gt; 6 SP (given the T6 Helms socket bonus) even in it's current form (45 second cooldown) and given that it may proc on worthless abilities like VT and MB.</div>

That would get a lot more complicated because of socket bonuses and those meta gem requirements, going on a strait SP conversion of 6 crit to 1 SP the only gem that would/could be worth it are:<br>
<br>
<a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=25895"><span><span class="bluename">[Enigmatic Skyfire Diamond]</span></span></a> = 2 SP<br>
<a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34220"><span><span class="bluename">[Chaotic Skyfire Diamond]</span></span></a> = 2 SP + Extra crit damage.<br>
<br>
Which when you take the trade offs are <br>
<br>
<a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34220"><span><span class="bluename">[Chaotic Skyfire Diamond]</span></span></a> + 2x<a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32215"><span><span class="purplename">[Glowing Shadowsong Amethyst]</span></span></a> - 2x<a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32196"><span><span class="purplename">[Runed Crimson Spinel]</span></span></a> = -10 SP + Extra crit damage<br>
<br>
I'm still fairly convince that the <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=25893"><span><span class="bluename">[Mystical Skyfire Diamond]</span></span></a> will end up the best even with it's periodic screw ups of being used on any spell other then MF.</div>

</div>The trick is to modify your rotation when it procs so that you cast mind flay before casting mind blast.  For example, if you cast death and focus comes up when mind blast is on cooldown, you cast mind flay instead and then blast right after.  The only times you miss focus procs are when your rotation has you cast two 1.5 second casts in a row and you get focus on the first.  In my experience this happens less than 15% of the time.  And because focus tends to proc around once every 50 seconds (45 second internal cooldown and 15% proc rate), this works out to around one useful proc per minute.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">The trick is to modify your rotation when it procs so that you cast mind flay before casting mind blast.  For example, if you cast death and focus comes up when mind blast is on cooldown, you cast mind flay instead and then blast right after.  The only times you miss focus procs are when your rotation has you cast two 1.5 second casts in a row and you get focus on the first.  In my experience this happens less than 15% of the time.  And because focus tends to proc around once every 50 seconds (45 second internal cooldown and 15% proc rate), this works out to around one useful proc per minute.</div>

		<div id="post_message_577328">Longevity is a not very useful value to evaluate mana, though. Much better to calculate how much dmg you could do over X minute fight than how much time it would take you to go oom. After all if 1 does 1300 DPS for 8 mins and the other does 1200 DPS for 10 minutes, if the 1300 dps person still does 1100 DPS for the last 2 minutes by using a more efficient rotation, the 1100 DPS rotation wins even though his longevity is 4/5 of the 1200 DPS person. It really really depends on a lot of factors (how much of your mana is from regen? How much from cooldowns? How many times can those cooldowns be used?). "Time till oom" is not one of those factors.</div>

		<div id="post_message_577411">As of right now, I have a shadowpriest alt at 40 that I'm planning on having at 70 before the end of January. It is on a fresh server and a different faction then my own, so it's a real reroll. <br>
<br>
My plan is to have my first week at 70 be spent farming FSW/Spellstrike and their sockets, depending on how much I have left after questing &amp; buying normal flyer, followed by gathering up the honor for s1 dagger/s3 bracer, followed by enchant money. In short, my primary goal is to skip as much of the entry level 5 man and kara content and move into ssc/tk/za level content asap. <br>
<br>
However, I'm not sure what exactly I REALLY need to work on picking up. Aside from head&amp;shoulder enchant farming, are there any rep. factions or instances that i really shouldn't be neglecting, and for what reasons? Most of the exalted items look like they aren't worth the trouble invested for their alternatives. <br>
<br>
Thanks a lot.<br>
<br>
edit: What exactly causes the animation problems with pw:s and shadowform right now? Shadowform's wispy blue &amp; black trail disappears sometimes when I go into combat, and the same for shield. I know the pw:s disappearing thing is a bug, but what about the wispy trail? It's so pretty =(</div>

</div>Thanks  I'm not sure i'd go for s2 dagger because I can probably get s1+bracers in one bg weekend if I drop an all-nighter or do a few 6pm-1am bg sessions. I usually pull in around 600+g on heavy farm days, so finishing up fsw/spellstrike shouldn't take more than a week (not to mention that the items I typically farmed are worth about 30% more on this server than they were on dragonmaw). <br>
<br>
Aside from that, yeah, I planned to lfg for heroics (mech mainly) while farming and only take the invites that were worth the time, as that's usually what I do. My biggest concern is missing something from heroics or reputation that's really worthwhile in terms of the amount of usage I'll get out of the item vs. time I spend putting into the item. I've decided on scryer for ring, trinket (so that I don't have to go out of my way on hit) &amp; heal staff in the event of a suddenly needed respec.  <br>
<br>
My goal though is to be T5 level status without having to do a bajillion weeks of Kara/heroic runs that could have been avoided by a more efficient usage of time &amp; farming.</div>

I've been through T5 level raids, but this was quite some time back before I scrapped my mage for raiding altogether. When we did have a spriest, they either died or weren't well geared. For maximum DPS capability, I just scrap VE from my rotation unless it's absolutely necessary, right?</div>

</div>I use VE for trash but generally not for bosses unless it's needed. Shadowpriests have easy access to exceptional quality gear early, so from Kara through to Vashj/Kael expect to be sitting at least top 10 if you gear up appropriately and don't just sit there refeshing dots and spamming MF. While I've never been passed Kael, I hear that we don't scale as well in extreme high-end gear but since I don't have access to any of this, don't take what I say too seriously </div>

That's a bunch of Hyjal/BT fights, plus a few TK bosses.  Browse through it at your leisure.  In general, you'll maintain competitive DPS, but the fight will have to favor you in order to beat near or at the top.  Illidan is an example, I was #2 on a kill without even really trying.  This is because you can DOT both elementals, go all out in phase 1, DOT Illidan during his demon phase, and keep DOTs rolling through demon -&gt; transitions because of fade.  Other fights don't favor DOT classes (such as Kaz'rogal) and the melee/anything that can burn very quickly for 2-3 minutes will shine.</div>

For maximum DPS capability, I just scrap VE from my rotation unless it's absolutely necessary, right?</div>

</div>You really won't hit more than 1200 to 1400 even with the best of gear, unless something really odd is happening like you are getting Bloodlust from more than one shaman.  Again, you'll still top a few fights like Illidan, but towards the end of T6 you'll be near the bottom of the meters.<br>
<br>
<b>That's okay!</b><br>
<br>
The "scaling" problem is really due to the extreme benefit priests provide the raid.  When a mage gears up, the mage deals more damage.  When a shadow priest gears up, the shadow priest AND all mages deal more damage.  The basic design of the class makes it impossible to top damages meters once everyone has high end gear.</div>

</div>I used T5 helm + shoulders over Frozen Shadoweave for a long time.  The extra mana regeneration helps a lot at that gear level, before your damage is good enough to last essentially forever.  The gloves are truly terrible.  The only reason to take them is to try the 4 piece set bonus before you can get the chest, and even that is just a minor DPS win.<br>
<br>
The most efficient use of gearing is to grab T5 helm and shoulders, Trousers of the Astromancer from Solarian (primarily because no one else want is, so it will be cheap), and keep the gloves from Attumen.  Don't bother with the T5 chest either, because once Kael'thas dies, there are much better upgrades for you in Black Temple.  Let other people have the chest who need it more.  You won't upgrade your chest until Illidan dies.</div>

</div>I think this has already been mentioned in this thread, but you'd have to miss a proc something like more than once every 6 times for the crit meta to be better. Considering that we only cast three spells that will consume the proc, the law of averages tells us that even if you don't actively attempt to use the proc on MF, even if you completely ignored it and used your regular cast rotation, it's still going to be the best gem available.</div>

</div>The buff is currently six seconds, and I generally just reorder my casts if so.  The only situation where things even get a little messed up is when it procs at the start of a Mind Flay (3 seconds left when cast finishes) and you need to cast both Shadow Word Death and Shadow Word Pain.  In this case I cast one of them, then the hasted flay, then the other.  It's still a net increase in damage.  Plus the proc averages once every 50 seconds, so you can still waste 1 in 6 procs and get one hasted flay per minute.<br>

</div>Missing 1 in 6 is enough to get a Focus proc one per minute.  As far as when <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34220"><span><span class="bluename">[Chaotic Skyfire Diamond]</span></span></a> is a good choice, I ran some quick napkin math and the answer is "It's never better than 12 spell damage".  Here's the math:<br>
<br>
Generously assume 50% of your damage comes from spells that can crit, and generously assume a 40% crit rate. Without the diamond, this means 60% of the spells do 60 shares of damage and 40% deal 60 shares of damage, so the crit portion is 20 shares of 120 total.  With 3% extra crit damage, this increases to .53 * 40 = 21.2 shares of damage, or an increase of 1.2 (from 120 to 121.2).  That's a 1% increase in damage from sources that crit, which is a 0.5% increase in overall DPS.  At 1200 DPS under these other crazy assumptions, that's still only 6 extra DPS, which is at best comparable to the 12 spell damage metagem.  (Worse actually, because it doesn't come with run speed.)<br>
<br>
So it's never good.</div>

</div>For mages and destro warlocks, the gem is a bit better than Mystical Skyfire, and almost none of their casts will accidentally eat the focus.  Basically just Scorch.  That said, I'd love a talent that gives priests a bonus to crit damage to get crits in the +100% damage range.  It still wouldn't make crit a stat to stack, but at least it wouldn't be 6 to 8 times worse than spell damage.  But even with such a talent and a 40% crit rate, the metagem would only give +12 DPS, half as good as Mystical Skyfire.</div>

		<div id="post_message_582980">MSD might approach the benefit of 48 spell damage if I could always consume the proc with a Mind Flay without disrupting my cast cycle, but that's just not how things work out for me in actual game play. Aside from the fact that I am a human being and will occasionally hit something other than Mind Flay by mistake while the proc is up, there are plenty of boss mechanics that make it less likely to be able to cast a Flay within the first few seconds following a proc.<br>
<br>
Off the top of my head:<br>
<br>
Winterchill - I get Tombed or get D&amp;D on top of me right after proc<br>
Anetheron - An Infernal add dies right after proc and I can't reach boss in time for Flay<br>
Kaz'rogal - Very friendly fight, MSD is very strong here<br>
Azgalor - Silence/RoF on me immediately after proc<br>
Archimonde - Running away from Doomfire, Air Burst/Fear right after Focus proc<br>
Naj'entus - I have stop casting and move to click a spine out of a neighbor<br>
Supremus - Very friendly in phase one, but I'm frequently out of Flay range altogether during kite phase<br>
Shade of Akama - Pretty friendly other than running down any loose adds in phase one<br>
Teron - Very friendly fight, MSD is very strong here<br>
<br>
Etcetera, etcetera. I'm sure you can all think of more.<br>
<br>
On fights that require lots of mobility, like Archimonde and Supremus phase two, my DoTs can be the bulk of my damage and the +12/runspeed meta is arguably a better choice (not to mention that the extra run speed helps with survivability, assuming for some reason you don't use +9sta/runspeed on your boots). It's a similar situation for the 2-piece Spellstrike bonus and for the stacking +dam effect from the Darkmoon trinket.<br>
<br>
And yes, it's still better to cast a proc'ed Mind Flay than it is to refresh a DoT, but that's still a little bit of missing uptime on that DoT that I would otherwise have. I occasionally trade off some minor dps losses in return for the substantial gains from the proc.<br>
<br>
I certainly intend to keep using the MSD, but I don't entertain any fantasies that it even starts to approach something like 48 spell damage in any real-world scenario. I strikes me as more reasonable to value it at one-third to two-thirds of whatever I theorycraft the ideal value to be, shading upwards for static tank and spank scenarios, and downwards for high-mobility fights that don't always afford the luxury of staying in a full burn cycle.</div>

</div>The problem with this analysis is that for most examples, when you can't mind flay, you can't cast other damage spells either, so you're also getting a reduced benefit from potentially having a spell damage metagem instead.  Those examples basically come down to, "In fight X you only get to spend 60% of your time doing DPS, so only 60% of focus procs help".  That's true, but increased spell damage also only gives 60% of the theoretical benefit in that situation as well.<br>
<br>
The only situations that matter are fights where you are out of range for mind flay but in range for mind blast and DoTs, and I can't think of any fights like that.  You list infernals on Anetheron, but our shadow priests are instructed to stay on Anetheron full time (since the shadow priest ramp up time is so long).  And for Supremus, I normally have no problem staying in Mind Flay range, although I do move around a lot to stay at max range.</div>

60% DPS time is far from 60% focus procs being useable, as you could just dps for a full 60% block then not dps for 40%, losing at most 1 focus proc, or you could dps-stop-dps-stop losing at most 2 focus procs, etc. Basically you should never have something as low as 60% focus procs on a 60% DPS time fight, the effect DPS "breaks" have on focus procs is in fact much much lower. To get 60% of your focus procs you would need to have 6s breaks after 40% of your spells, which has no direct connection to your % DPS time.</div>

		<div id="post_message_583176">The problem is not spending X percentage out of Mind Flay range during a fight; the problem crops up in any situation where I can proc Focus and be unable to consume it with a Mind Flay before it expires. My point is that this can happen not only due to player error but can also be more likely due to certain kinds of boss mechanics.<br>
<br>
Let's take a hypothetical boss mechanic where he puts a 10 second debuff on me any time I damage him; he is immune to all of my abilities while that debuff is up. How useful is MSD in this extremely contrived situation? It's worthless. I'll never be able to make effective use of the improved cast time. By contrast, I would still receive the full benefit of a +12 spell damage meta, just over a greatly reduced number of casts.<br>
<br>
The key difference is that the benefit of +spell damage is always realized immediately at cast time. Proc-based abilities never are. Their benefit is only realized in future casts. This is a risky proposition any time I cannot guarantee that I will be able to cast another spell a few seconds after the one I'm casting right now. There are plenty of such boss encounters already in the game, and they are not friendly for any proc-based gear, including the MSD.<br>
<br>
My secondary point is that using the proc only with a Mind Flay will occasionally require me to forego an optimal DoT refresh cycle and will cost me a small but non-negligible dps penalty due to slightly lower DoT uptime. This makes the net benefit less than 48 spell damage, even in an otherwise ideal scenario.<br>
<br>
My final point is that I am a human being and not a robot. I will occasionally consume Focus procs with Vamp Touch or Mind Blast becase that was the next spell in my rotation and I didn't notice that the proc was up in time to change to a Flay. This will happen more often when I am tired, when I am learning a new boss, or when I am in a situation where I am distracted because I have to move a lot to avoid boss abilities that will otherwise kill me.<br>
<br>
All of these factors add up to reduce the ideal gain you would receive from an MSD, which would be something close to the extra half a mind flay every minute that you cited earlier in the thread. That is not an incorrect statement; it's just a statement based on theory and not on practice.<br>
<br>
To get a statement based on practice, people would have to raid with two separate gear sets that were otherwise identical with the exception of the socketed metagem and report the results of their combat log parses over many, many hours of raiding.</div>

		<div id="post_message_583259">You are correct that the gain is not really 1/2 a MF every proc, not even close. However the loss of procs isn't nearly as bad as you describe. Overall I think the "stand and cast" dps value is what was taken into consideration from those using the simulation to evaluate the items, so the only loss over that simulation is if your next cast cannot happen becuase of fight mechanics. The % of the procs you're going to lose to fight mechanics is actually rather small. For example if a fight gives you 20s DPS time then 20s no-DPS time, you'll have 50% DPS time, however you will only lose 1/(spells cast in 20s) of the procs, which is much much smaller than 1/2. Fight mechanics lower the benefit from MSD - yes - but only a little bit. And the DoT rotation problem is probably taken into account in the simulation, although I'd go and double check this. All in all no matter what factors you'd take into account for losing MSD effects, I don't see how some spell dmg meta can outdo it (although I can see why you would favor head pieces with no meta slots  )</div>

		<div id="post_message_583293">Again, as tedv noted, it's not the overall percentage of time within dps range that is an issue. It's the potential frequency of cast cycle interruptions.<br>
<br>
Static spell haste doesn't suffer from this issue. It's the fact that the effect MSD is proc-based, not that it happens to be spell haste. The proc-based effect from 2-piece Spellstrike has exactly the same drawbacks as the MSD proc, and for pretty much the same reasons.<br>
<br>
I'm not arguing against the MSD; even with the drawbacks that I mention, it is still so much better than any of the alternatives that's it's nearly always the best choice. The only realistic exceptions I can think of are one-offs like an Azgalor strat where all of the ranged dps is forbidden to get with range of his RoF ability and you are thus forbidden to ever get within range for casting any Mind Flays.<br>
<br>
I am not anti-MSD, or even anti-proc; it's just another tool in the toolbox. I think it's important to understand that the effectiveness of this particular tool can be greatly curtailed whenever I am frequently forced to move or am otherwise interrupted a lot by boss mechanics, and starts to really shine whenever I can stay in my full-burn spell cycle for large, uninterrupted chunks of time.</div>

The reason I ask is I'm wondering if 5/5 weaving has a significant gain on trash mobs, specifically the Hyjal trash waves.<br>
<br>
I remember there being an equation on how to check the percent chance that the shadow weaving debuff will fall off a target with each percentage of shadow weaving and your +hit value.

Equates to a *very* low chance of it falling off (~0.008%).  The bigger problem is that it can lead to higher stacking times.<br>
<br>
(At 3/5, it's about a 0.5% chance of it falling off at any given cast.)<br>
<br>
For Hyjal trash, stackup effects and the fact that it's hard to stack weaving on multiple targets simultaneously is probably more significant than 4/5 vs. 5/5.</div>

What is the formula to calculate the damage cap, and is there anything that can boost you beyond that cap effectively?  Not pots, flasks or food or anything like that... Like a buff that allows you to go off the chart.. .like Imp Divine Spirit that increases your damage/ healing by 10% of your spirit.<br>
<br>
I heard 1200 damage is the effective cap on damage, beyond that you get nominal returns on that +spell damage.  I heard the only possible way to go beyond that are with the foods/ pots/ flasks, and Imp Divine Spirit.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">It'll be something along the lines of (1 - ((K)*H))^N, where K is your Weaving chance (0,0.2,0.4,0.6,0.8,1), H is your hit chance (0-0.99), and N is the number of spells you cast in a given 15 second time period.<br>
<br>
So, for 4/5 weaving, hitcapped, using an N of <br>
<br>
.25 VE <br>
.5 SWP<br>
1 VT<br>
1.2 SWD<br>
2 MB <br>
2.5 MF<br>
<br>
~7.5 in a perfectish rotation, call it 6 since casts don't always line up neatly.<br>
<br>
Equates to a *very* low chance of it falling off (~0.008%).  The bigger problem is that it can lead to higher stacking times.<br>
<br>
(At 3/5, it's about a 0.5% chance of it falling off at any given cast.)<br>
<br>
For Hyjal trash, stackup effects and the fact that it's hard to stack weaving on multiple targets simultaneously is probably more significant than 4/5 vs. 5/5.</div>

</div>As you've alluded to, not only does it affect you, but also the warlocks in your raid as well. I still run with 5/5 and on rare occasions we run with 3 Shadow Priests (usually 2). This would seem overkill, but...running with less than 5/5 SW lowers your DPS as well as your fellow raid member DPS, especially in situations where you are fighting multiple targets (mainly aoe). This is most noticeable in Hyjal for me. As I've mentioned in this thread, I attempt to stack misery and SW on all targets in an aoe situation. Not only is it huge DPS for me, but also improves AOE dps. Really, the numbers are probably small enough to be marginal (it's only 2% one out of every five casts) and hugely relative to your play style. Honestly though, it's a huge annoyance to me to cast a spell on a target and not see SW get stacked.</div>

</div>I have been running with 4/5 shadow weaving for ages. With at least two shadow priests in the raid (and we almost always run with 3, so 2 is a given) I think the percent chance of SW falling off is so low that it wont fall off but once every... year? 10 years? My question was more how much dps would be gained from a target being "weaved up" faster by a 5/5 shadow priest instead of a 4/5. There is a high chance that in a given situation it will be the same time (ie the chance that the 4/5 priest hits SW for each of his first 5 casts). There is a larger chance, I would assume, that the 5/5 would weave it faster, most likely 1-2 casts faster, and I am wondering if there is a way to put a concrete number on his dps gain because of that.</div>

</div>1-(.8^5) = 67.232% that at least one out of your 5 casts would fail to apply weaving.  That's pretty big.<br>
<br>
Having said that, I run with 4/5 as typically the only shadow priest in the raid now.  Not having a weaving apply on the ramp up is pretty insignificant.  What would be significant would be having it fall off, but the odds are extremely low.  How low?   Lets assume in a 15 second interval you are casting at least 6 spells. ( 1 VT, 2 MB, 1 SWD, 2 MF)  The odds of at least one of those applying weaving would be:  1-(.2^6)= 99.9936%.   <br>
<br>
One can argue the trash perspective, or for something like Kael weapon phase, but if you're only putting 1  SWP up then you're losing 2% damage at most when it fails to apply.  The bigger thing to get up anyways in that situation is Misery.</div>

</div>Speaking from personal experience, threat is next to no issue in T6 content. All of hyjal's bosses have "low" armor (I believe 6200) which really boosts the tanks threat. Further, there is usually a mechanic that prevents you from standing and nuking for long enough to catch up to the tanks threat. Rage and Kaz'rogal are the only fights that can go uninterrupted (if you get good luck with DD and the marks of Kaz) but I have never had to slow down on either fight. BT fights are similar, Terron is a straight nuke fest, but again because of the low armor and truly unlimited rage for the tank, there seems little chance of a threat issue. Recently I did a Najentus without a paladin in the raid (read: no BoS) and with VE up full time I still didnt have to slow down. Considering that Najentus has regular armor, and the VE agro is tremendous from the consistent raid damage, I think its safe to say the minus 2% threat meta is unnecessary.<br>
<br>
Further, the 2% less threat is only useful if you would have otherwise needed to slow down or stop dps (in which case 2% less threat is in a way 2% more damage). However, if you would have been able to keep dpsing without the 2% threat modifier, than the meta was a complete waste. I think the latter (a complete waste) will be the case for the majority of boss encounters, if not all of them, in T6.</div>

</div>Okay, since you asked for it... because it's a crappy gem?  +9 damage and a largely irrelevant -threat at that point in the game, along with an ugly gem requirement.  More yellow than blue?  When the T6 helm has a blue socket?  <br>

"More priests" don't have too much of a problem making use of the half-cast gem, that's why, and it's hands down superior to the best passive meta.</div>

</div>Actually I would suspect that the MSD actually gets better (compared to other meta gems) as you start spending time unable to cast.  It is only wasted in the rare circumstance that the interruption happens after the MSD procs but before you can make use of the proc.  If the interruption happens at any other time then the internal cooldown on the MSD will keep running, effectively increasing the proc rate based on actual cast time.<br>
<br>
Don't forget that the CSD is completely useless while not casting - no casting means no chance to crit.  Although I guess if the interruption is very short then it would help with MB cooldowns (but if the interruption is this short, the MSD proc duration will probably be long enough to still cast a double speed MF).<br>
<br>
The BED is also almost completely useless while not casting - the only impact it will have is that dot's will continue to tick at a slightly higher amount.</div>

</div>This is a common misconception about how threat works.  Often people assume that because the final factor is reduced, they are getting less of a benefit from it.  In reality, multiplying threat factors maintains the proportion of extra threat that must be generated to pull aggro.<br>
<br>
For example, consider the effect of an additional 50% reduction in threat.  This ability will let you generate twice as much threat before pulling aggro, no matter what other modifiers there are.  Suppose the threat ceiling is 10,000 with no threat reduction.  Look at the effect of a 50% reduction applied to a variety of starting threat modifiers.  (The actual ceiling is 10000 / modifier.)<br>

 20% (50,000) =&gt; 10% (100,000)</pre>
</div>A 2% reduction in threat will ALWAYS be a 2% increase in damage you can deal before pulling aggro.  This is why Tranquil air totem is good, by the way, even though many people think it's bad for the same reason.  ("It's only a 9% reduction!")</div>

</div>Yeah, I'd put it as solidly better than the CSD.  I actually do intend to get one for my T5 helm (which has a gemming requirement that supports its use)... once I get a T6 helm.  Basically I'd only use it on Bloodboil, though, because it's incredibly easy to threatcap on that fight.  On anything else, the MSD is solidly better.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">While it's true that the MB and SW:P cooldowns aren't head-to-head often, SW:P will always do more DPS per global, if it runs the full duration (bosses).<br>
<br>
Without 2pc T6, SW:P will tick 8 times. If we take an average tick of 600 (yes, this is quite low to send home the message), we can expect 8 * 600 for 4800 damage over a 1.5 second global (3200 DPS). Again, this is close to the lowest end of SW:P's DPS capability. I can personally expect closer to 8100 damage done (5400 DPS)<br>
<br>
Without even going into the math, with 4pc T6 and Imp. SB proc, I'm looking at mid-4800 crits from MB. That is, if the stars are all aligned, MB will _match_ the lowest expectations from SW:P. Averaged over a fight, the MB GCD falls behind.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>I was thinking about this, and the logic behind it seemed flawed so I started running through it.  The premise in the above math is the full damage per cast of SW:P vs Mind blast.  This would be useful if recasting SW:P did all of its damage, but it doesn't, unless it has run its course.<br>
<br>
So instead, I propose a differential comparison.  The situations where this is relevant is: option to cast pain or mind blast, and options to cast pain or mind blast, with VT ending between 1.5 and 3 seconds from now.  This premise operates on attempting maximum VT uptime.<br>
<br>
A note: in the quoted text, a 600 pain tick was mentioned as being low, but my calculated pain ticks are comming in at about 570.  Taking into account his gear (1300 shadow damage, 29% crit), my pain ticks land at 639.  My numbers only account for priest specific talents: 25% increased damage from talents, and 15% increased damage to target.<br>
<br>
In the first instance, from time zero, if you cast pain, it will go up immediately, and blast will be cast at 3 seconds.  If you cast blast, then pain, blast is cast at 1.5 seconds, and so will pain (while latency is an issue, it will be addressed later).  An enginneered spreadsheet came up with these DPS values at 25% crit (assuming talents) and 1000 shadow damage:<br>
<br>
DPS:<br>
Flay: 536<br>
Blast: 1251<br>
Death: 1128<br>
Pain: 187<br>
<br>
Conceptually, if you cast pain then blast, you are trading 1.5 seconds of blast dps for 1.5 seconds of pain + flay dps, due to the cooldown on blast.  As blast DPS is higher than Flay + Pain combined (1251-536-187=528dps, or 792 damage), you will do more damage casting blast and then pain.<br>
<br>
In the second situation, you would cast pain, then renew VT, then cast mindblast, or you would cast blast, renew VT, then cast pain.  You trade 1.5 seconds of mind blast dps for 1.5 seconds of mind flay dps and 3 seconds of pain dps.  An additional 1.5 seconds of pain dps will still result in the loss of 512 damage by casting pain first.<br>
<br>
A similar comparison using death instead of blast results in 607 damage lost in the first example, or 327 lost in the VT example.<br>
<br>
Additional crit over the model obviously favors blast/death more, additional + damage has a minimal effect on the damage difference (at 1300 damage its 832 damage lost, or 513 in the VT example, compared to 792 and 512).  This makes sense because in a pure dps sense, blast gets more from + damage than pain, as pain gets 1.1/18 = 6% +damage per second, while pain gets .4286/1.5=28.6% +damage/second (ignoring crit, which skews it slightly higher), and flay gets .59/3=19.7% +damage per second.<br>
<br>
This model assumes mana is a non-issue.  The optimization here also exists in the realm of cancelling mind flays to mind blast or shadow word: death, which needs to be executed well to actually provide a benefit.  As this situation could only come up an absolute maximum of every 24 seconds (assuming no 2pT6 and talented pain), and is more likely to come up not more than every couple minutes, the dps increase is extremely small (Max end of 34.7 dps increase, much more likely in the range of 3-7 DPS.)<br>
<br>
It does, however, imply a change in the "priority" list for spellcasting:<br>
<br>
VT<br>
MB<br>
SW:D<br>
SW:P<br>
MF<br>
<br>
Base damage has the 25% bonus, and the 15% target bonus, applied to it.  I'm not sure in which forms percent bonuses are multiplicative, but it does not change the conclusion in this case.<br>
<br>
	Dmg	Cast	Mana	+Dmg	Coefficient	Base Dmg	Crit %	Avg Dmg	DPS<br>
Flay	528	3	230	1000	0.59	1607	0	1607	536<br>
Blast	731.5	1.5	450	1000	0.4286	1668	0.25	1877	1251<br>
Death	618	1.5	309	1000	0.4286	1504	0.25	1692	1128<br>
Pain	1236	18	575	1000	1.1	3358	0	3358	187<br>
									<br>
									<br>
DPS difference	1.5 second delay	3 second delay							<br>
528	                       792	                  511.5							<br>
405                                  607.5                   327<br>
<br>
I can't post the actual spreadsheet currently, but the math is there...I'd love any corrections, or any additional thoughts on any of the logic or math.</div>

</div>1128 DPS over a 12 second cooldown period implies that SW is hitting for 13,536 - an impressive number, to say the least. I think your numbers for Blast and Death here are in fact damage per cast time, and not actual damage per second.</div>

		<div id="post_message_591562">The numbers are obviously not all damage per cast time, as the SW:P would be much higher.  The numbers are the DPS that that spell has when you're casting it, as your effective DPS is based on cast time when it comes to straight cast spells as opposed to dots, and this assumes a maximized VT uptime, so the only dot is SW:P.  <br>
<br>
For instance: if you were to chain cast fireball, and it had a dps value of 1600, you would do 1600 dps.  if you're looking at an individual time period of the single cast time of a fireball, your dps is still 1600, and effectively the spell's individual dps is 1600.<br>
<br>
While you cannot chain cast the spells being referenced, in the individual timeframe you are making choices of which spells to cast, which affects your ability to use these spells in the future.  Thus, a comparison of the DPS done in that individual timeframe by the possible spells that would be used provides information of what spells are "better" for a priority system.  Postponing casting spells now that have a cooldown and are reset will effectively lower your dps if those cooldowned spells will do more damage than the non-cooldown spells you are casting instead (this can be seen anecdotally by JUST using VT, SW:P, and MF: the more MB you add, the more your DPS goes up, as MB is a higher DPS spell)<br>
<br>
A bit of this premise keeps bugging me, though: while in theory you are "replacing" 1.5 seconds of MB time with additional MF time, you are only technically pushing the MB time 1.5 seconds into the future.  As all fights are of finite length, unless you "push off" a MB off the end of the theoretical "fight length", you have not actually lowered your dps, only switched around the position of your spells.  It would take a maximum of 4 iterations to "push off" a MB and thus lose the DPS (assuming 4/5 or 5/5 imp MB), and an additional 4 after the first one was lost for each additional DPS loss.  I don't feel confident enough in this analysis to "hang my hat on it", but I would think then that the "DPS increase" numbers would be variable, but on average could be divided by 4, for a max increase of 5 DPS and a more likely increase of 1-2 DPS.  Any insight on accurate quantification of this would be welcomed and interesting.</div>

		<div id="post_message_591620">The issue I have with that model is, if SWP only does 157 DPS, then why cast it at all? MF spam should theoretically ALWAYS lead to higher DPS. Except that it doesn't. While you've calculated the theoretical DPS increase at the <i>beginning</i> of the cycle. You haven't calculated the DPS at the <i>end</i> of the cycle. I'm not saying your wrong, it just seems incomplete. You don't seem to be taking into account that SWP actually ticks for the full 24 seconds from the beginning of the cast. If you wait an extra 1.5-4.5 seconds to cast it, you may be increasing your current DPS, but what about 24 seconds down the road? 48 seconds down the road? If you wait an average of an extra 3 seconds to reapply pain due to placing MB and SWD higher in your priority, you may be gaining 327 or 607 damage initially, but are you gaining or losing that damage in the end by not having SWP ticking for that last amount of time? I mean, what you're really doing is adding an artificial cooldown to SWP in order to lower the cooldown (over the course of 4-5 rotations) of MB.<br>
<br>
Good posts though. I'm sure there is someone who has access to an automated script or something that can properly model both priority systems to see which comes out higher. If I feel up to it I might go Dr. Boom for awhile and see which comes out ahead for me. Anecdotal evidence doesn't seem like it will be enough to convince me or anyone else. <br>
<br>
edit: After some more thought, I am thinking that you are correct, but there is going to be a point in + spell damage that putting MB+SWD ahead of SWP will be a decrease in DPS due to spell scaling alone. It would be great to know what that point is and if it falls anywhere along a spectrum where we should be concerned (somewhere between 0-2k shadow damage) about <i>which</i> priority system to use .</div>

		<div id="post_message_591630">Recently, I've been approaching the priority list problem more from a 'What is the maximum amount of damage I could possibly do?' approach and it has also caused me to rethink the placing of SW:P over MB in the priority list.<br>
<br>
The way I theorycraft things is to start with a fixed fight length, say 3 minutes (180 seconds) against a single target.<br>
<br>
In this fight, the maximum number of SW:P ticks one can have in this fight is 60. The fight length also suggests that you will cast SW:P 8 times (I'm pre-T6, so no 2pc bonus for me, for T6 2pc, you only cast SW:P 7 times). The question then becomes, in practice, how many fewer ticks than 60 do I get (this is ultimately the dot uptime question). Clearly, MB and SW:P won't be up at the same time 8 times during a 3 minute fight, but lets imagine it happens 2 times and you delay casting SW:P by 1.5 seconds each time. This would mean, you lost 3 seconds or 1 tick of SW:P damage as a result.<br>
<br>
Now, lets look at the reverse. If you delay casting MB by 1.5 seconds twice, that would be 3 seconds of MB damage lost. Assuming 4/5 Imp. Mind Blast (another pre-T6 assumption), the casting + cooldown cycle of MB is 7.5 seconds, so 3 seconds represents 40% of a MB cycle. In my experience, 40% of a MB cycle is greater damage than 1 tick of SW:P. <br>
<br>
I don't agree with prioritizing SW over SW:P though. 3 seconds is only 25% of a SW cycle, which is less than a SW:P tick. Returning to my 3 minute fight example, you can only fit a max of 15 SW into a 3 minute fight and it seems more realistic to aim for 13-14. Even eating up 6 seconds at the start, still gives 6 seconds of slack for the rest of the fight.<br>
<br>
I've seen similar stuff on shadowpriest.com with the associated comment that a priority list that favors MB is more mana intensive, but higher DPS.</div>

</div>No, just...no.  If SW:P did 1/3 of its usual damage per tick, you'd use MB/SW:D and possibly MF ahead of it.  The question is DPS, not DoT uptime.  You CAN learn this from theorycrafting and apply it.<br>
<br>
The question was, and will always remain, what do you lose the least amount of damage by postponing?  Some of the recent posters are correct, MB IS better than SW:P...at higher gear levels, more points in Improved Mind Blast, and/or 4 piece t6 bonus.  However, at lower levels of gear or if you don't abuse Improved Mind Blast, SW:P before MB will result in more DPS.  Divide the average amount of Mind Blast damage by its cooldown + 1.5 seconds.  Divide a SW:P tick by 3.  Use whichever spell results in a larger number first.  SW:D can also be calculated by dividing the damage by 12.  You can figure out what order those spells should usually be in based upon your gear and talents.<br>
<br>
At lower levels, you'll get...<br>
1. SW:P<br>
2. MB<br>
3. SW:D<br>
<br>
At higher levels, you'll get...<br>
1. MB<br>
2. SW:P<br>
3. SW:D<br>
<br>
Theoretically, SW:D might pull ahead at some extreme level, but I'm not sure what that point is.  It technically scales better than SW:P but SW:P has a large base lead.</div>

</div>I realize I did not explain the situation correctly.  You keep Pain up because for 24-27 seconds, you have tacked approximately 200 dps onto everything you do for a single cooldown.  From a pure cooldown perspective, Pain, upwards of 4500-5500 damage for 1.5 seconds of casting, is the bets spell available.  However, you only get that dps on that cast every 24/27 seconds.  You are losing "seconds" of uptime by postponing refreshing it, however, you will put it back up, thus the DPS calculations to determine losing the ~200 dps for a second or two to use a much higher DPS spell.  This is why the situations I brought up are so narrow, and as stated, will only come up occationally and lead to a relatively slight DPS increase, but do change the priority system.<br>
<br>
<br>
Can the two people dividing the damage by the cooldown time explain why you are doing this?  As far as I can tell, this only decreases the gain, not the total DPS.  If in the next three seconds I can SW:D/MB then refresh, or refresh then SW:D/MB, I am costing myself 1.5 seconds of MB time, which will be filled with MF + SW:P uptime.  Thus, the difference I am costing myself is the MB/SW:D value subtracting the MF + SW:D value in that time frame.  *That* difference would then be divided by the cooldown, for theoretical purposes (its discontinuous, as I discussed in an earlier post: you have to do a certain number of "optimizations" in your priority system to get a single additional MB/SW:D; anything before that may actually lower your DPS as you have cost yourself 1.5 seconds of pain uptime without gaining the additional dps of a mind blast, however when you get your additional cast you will get more.)<br>
<br>
Also, as discussed in an earlier post, the DPS difference is almost completely flat across spell damage increases, and crit obviously increasing MB/SW:D.  The look at spell damage coefficitients (primarily because MF has such a low coefficient, and Pain's per second coefficient isn't that great compared to a whopping 42.86% over 1.5 seconds) explains why this is relatively flat.  In any reasonably discussable + damage levels (750 and up), MB/SW:D will always outstrip the pain uptime.<br>
<br>
Any ideas on how to properly model the discontinuous gain function involving "gaining" additional casts?</div>

I stopped using 2% on cloak awhile back because I stopped seeing any benefit save that single fight. At least spell penetration helps on trash.

</div>Sadly, not everyone's guild is at you stage of progression.  My guild has taken down only 3 of the SSC/TK bosses (with 2 more close before our Christmas raiding break).  I am <b>always</b> threat capped unless I twiddle my thinbs for a while at the start of a fight.  It is very rare that I can put VE up until well into a fight, and then only on certain bosses (i.e Bear &amp; Lynx in ZA for example).<br>
<br>
Maybe our tanks are not as well geared as yours for threat generation, and maybe our Shaman's failure to use Tranquil Air Totems contributes to that equation.

				<div style="font-style:italic">Sadly, not everyone's guild is at you stage of progression.  My guild has taken down only 3 of the SSC/TK bosses (with 2 more close before our Christmas raiding break).  I am <b>always</b> threat capped unless I twiddle my thinbs for a while at the start of a fight.  It is very rare that I can put VE up until well into a fight, and then only on certain bosses (i.e Bear &amp; Lynx in ZA for example).<br>
<br>
Maybe our tanks are not as well geared as yours for threat generation, and maybe our Shaman's failure to use Tranquil Air Totems contributes to that equation.  All I know is that I routinely flirt with threat levels of 125%+, and 2% threat reduction definitely matters for me.</div>

</div>Well which bosses are we talking about? Hydross is threat sensitive for the first few seconds of each transition but the raid damage shouldn't be overwhelming to the point where you're putting out more TPS than the tank if you give him a few second lead. As long is someone is in melee range of Lurker he wont attack ranged so threat is a non-issue. Al'ar is tauntable so threat isn't an issue there. Once I stopped using VE on Void Reaver I had much less of a problem there too. What kind of TPS are your tanks putting out?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>There is no legitimate math or support in the linked thread for dividing the total dps by the cooldown time.  I'm not saying it doesn't exist, just that that link doesn't have any justifiable support behind it.<br>
<br>
What I've been trying to do and asking others is to quantify is that delay.  All the methodologies that appear accurate support delaying pain over MB/SW:D due to MB cooldown, i just can't come up with a good number...discontinuity is a pain.  The discontinuity also appears to give a very significant possibility of loss DPS due to "unrecovered" mindblasts if you delay SW:P.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Galzohar is correct.  It really is the difference of Concentration Aura.  When you see someone "just running around more" because they had fewer mind flay ticks, here's an example of what's going on when he casts a mind flay and gets interrupted:<br>
<br>
T 0: Cast mind flay (3 seconds remaining)<br>
T .5: Interrupted, 1 second cast penalty (1.5 second remaining)<br>
T 1: Damage tick (1 seconds remaining)<br>
T 1.2: Interrupted, .2 second cast penalty (.6 seconds remaining)<br>
T 1.8: Cast finishes<br>
<br>
So you get 1 damage tick in 1.8 seconds rather than 3 ticks in 3 seconds.  You will actually stand there channeling mind flay for the remaining .8 seconds even though you'll never deal extra damage from doing so.  If you only get one hit every 1.8 hit seconds, your Mind Flays are down to 55% of their normal damage.  That's a huge loss.<br>
<br>
Anecdotally, I've noticed a huge increase in my DPS on fights with pushback when I get concentration aura and/or earth shield.  The biggest example of this is phase 2 Reliquary of Souls, but even Najentus and phase 2 Illidan have a lot of pushback.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>We all understand that. Throw this into the equation: Theoretically you have a spell on a 7.5 second cooldown (from initial cast) that does ~2200 damage on average. Casting it every cooldown means 7.5s, 15s, 22.5s etc. The problem is in the conflict. Casting SWP first every time means you are really making the cooldown on MB 9s instead of 7.5.<br>
<br>
<br>
(0s)SWP&gt;(1.5s)MB&gt;(9s)MB&gt;(16.5s)MB&gt;(24s)SWP&gt;(25.5s)MB&gt;(33s)MB&gt;(40.5s)MB&gt;(48s)End<br>
Total Damage= (6000 X 2) + (2200 X 6)<br>
                    = <b>25200</b><br>
<br>
Here we cast MB first<br>
<br>
(0s)MB&gt;(1.5s)SWP&gt;(7.5s)MB&gt;(15s)MB&gt;(22.5s)MB&gt;(25.5s)SWP&gt;(30s)MB&gt;(37.5s)MB&gt;(45s)MB&gt;(48s  )End<br>
<br>
Total Damage= 6000 + (2200 X 7) + (750 X 7)<br>
                    = <b>26650</b><br>
<br>
<i><b>IF</b></i> we are able to cast MB every cooldown. Theoretically we can squeeze in a bit more damage because we can squeeze in an extra MB cast, simply by casting it first. There is a 3rd variable. VT comes as #1 priority for any SP that's worth their raid spot, otherwise we're just another DPS class with mediocre damage. So here are the numbers again, adding VT, prioritizing it first. We'll also assume it does 650 per tick which is on par with 750 SWP ticks and 2200 avg MBs.<br>
<br>
(0s)VT&gt;(1.5s)SWP&gt;(3s)MB&gt;(10.5s)MB&gt;(15s)VT&gt;(18s)MB&gt;<b>(25.5s)SWP&gt;(27s)MB</b>&gt;(30s)VT&gt;(34.5s)MB&gt;(42s)MB&gt;(45s)VT&gt;(48s)end<br>
<br>
Total Damage= 6000 + (750 X 7) + (2200 X 6) + (3250 X 3)<br>
                    = <b>34200</b><br>
<br>
Again prioritizing MB over SWP.<br>
<br>
(0s)VT&gt;(1.5s)MB&gt;(3s)SWP&gt;(9s)MB&gt;(15s)VT&gt;(16.5s)MB&gt;<b>(24s)MB&gt;(27s)SWP</b>&gt;(30s)VT&gt;(31.5s)MB&gt;(39s)MB&gt;(45s)VT&gt;(46.5s)MB&gt;(48s)end<br>
<br>
Total Damage= 6000 + (750 X 7) + (2200 X 7) + (3250 X 3)<br>
                    = <b>36400</b><br>
<br>
Notice how by prioritizing SWP over MB in the first scenario (I've bolded it) we pushed the cooldown of MB out, which means we fit in less MB's over the course of the trial period and we've gained 1/2 a tick of SWP (i.e 0 damage). In the second scenario, we start SWP 1.5s later but gain a FULL MB (I've bolded the part where MB/SWP line up so there is no conflict). Unfortunately the model is still incomplete. We've assumed perfect latency, no MF, no VE and no SWD. It's also a small time trial, the only fight in TBC that lasts 48s is bugged Akama. Most are between 3 and 15 minutes, but often somewhere in the middle.<br>
<br>
The question is, somewhere along the line, does moving MB up in your rotation actually cause it to conflict with VT and/or MF to where you are actually losing an MB <i>and</i> SWP ticks, therefore dropping your DPS.<br>
<br>
I ask again. Is there anyone that has access to a script or spreadsheet that can model this? I neither have the time nor the brain power at the moment to include every single variable. It would be best if we could also somehow assume 1% resists on any spell too.<br>
<br>
P.S. I am pretty sure the math I've done so far is proper. I double checked it a few times making sure to only count actual full ticks of SWP.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Because Pain DOESN'T work that way.  Quick math (and everyone knows this anecdotally anyways) that its effectively never worthwhile clipping the end of your DoTs.  Quick math also shows that @ 1000 shadow damage, as long as a fight has 6 seconds left you'll do more damage paining than MF.  In the instant cast 'nuke', pain would always be better not matter the duration on the fight, and in the second example pain would always be worse assuming a duration under 24 seconds.  Your examples, while anecdotally and debate-fully appealing, do not accurately represent the workings of those spells, so they aren't useful.<br>
<br>
Specifically: You do not get a discontinuous "burst" if Pain was a 24 second nuke, like you do with your discontinous nukes Blast and Death.  Pain's damage, assuming you are not "clipping" the end of the previous, is directly proportional to its "uptime" for all but the most pedantically precise models (as it will be slightly discontinuous due to the clipping of the final tick at mob death).  Mind Blast, however, is dependant on the number of casts: it doesn't do damage on "cooldown".<br>
<br>
A quick modelling of various lengths of fights with theoretical "optimum" DPS, and then playing with incrimental adjustments that priority systems would cause to account for inaccuracies.<br>
<br>
The optimal model is based on casting times: it assumes VT through the entire duration, Pain through the entire duration, Blast and Death on every cooldown.  Obviously this is impossible, but it provides an "optimal" baseline.  Note that VT is taken out of the casting times but not included in the DPS as i don't have the numbers lying around to add it, as it isn't changing and is static it only affects the appearance of the final number, and not actually the reultant changes.  This also assumes 100% use of cooldowns, with no latency issues, and perfect MF canceling for casting.  Obviously these are impossible, but the amount of "error" should be equivilant for a given player  (arguements to the contrary could possibly be made, I can't think of any but that doesn't mean they couldn't at least put a perspective on the modelling below):<br>
<br>
For every global cooldown (1.5 seconds) you lose of Pain (ie pain is not up for 1.5 seconds from optimal), you lose 2.33 dps in a 2 minute fight, 1.16 dps in a 4 minute fight, and .47 dps in a 10 minute fight.<br>
For every Mind Blast "Missed" in a 2 minute fight, you lose 15.6 dps, 7.8 dps in a 4 minute fight, and 3.12 dps in a 10 minute fight.<br>
For every Shadow word Death "Missed" in a 2 minute fight, you lose 14.1 dps, 7.1 dps in a 4 minute fight, and 2.82 dps in a 10 minute fight.<br>
<br>
As you should not feasably be able to lose more than 5 GCD of pain (7.5 seconds) without "retrieving" a "missed" mindblast, by prioritizing mindblast over pain, the net gain in DPS over a statistically large sample will be no less than 3.95 dps.  The maximum loss of DPS on a "bad roll" of just missing your last mind blast while prioritizing blast would be 9.33 DPS in a 2 minute fight, while the maximum gain would be along the lines of 19.5 DPS in a 2 minute fight.  The deviation grows smaller as the fights get longer, but the average overall DPS gain should be relatively static.<br>
<br>
Death requires 8 GCD of pain to "retrieve" a "missed' Death, resulting in a net DPS loss over statistically large samples.  In shorter fights, if you were somehow able to predict getting "one more death off", you could see somewhat significant (10+) DPS increases from prioritizing death.<br>
<br>
<br>
  I realize what was wrong with my previous calculations, and what i was missing: i was trying to consider getting a full SW:D or MB out of a single SW:P skip, which while theoretically possible is not likely and is the "top" end of the spectrum.  As I do not see a legitmate way to properly determine if an additional cooldown can be "retrieved" at the end of the fight when you would have to make that decision, I would conclude that for all cases SW:D is lower than SW:P:<br>
<br>
VT<br>
MB<br>
SW:P<br>
SW:D<br>
MF<br>
<br>

		<div id="post_message_593518"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->As for 1% resist, and VT conflicting cooldowns: I've been neglecting both because they're so unique and situational that there is no real way to statistically account for them.  As far as I can tell, a resist simply sets you back 1.5 seconds in your priority rotation, assuming you're operating properly (you will recast whatever you were trying to cast, unless its now time to cast something higher on the list, or you can't recast what you were trying to cast and thus move down the list).  I've made lots of various rotation speadsheets blocking out casting "cycles" and priority rotations, and you will ALWAYS have issues where VT collides with other spells, no matter how many points in improved MB you have nor how you prioritize your spells.  All of these models are just ignoring the fact that you will lose time to recasting VT, and assume it evenly screws everyone (much like a resist, it just stalls everything for 1.5 seconds, except its at the top, so you will just continue from where you were).  I didn't run into any correspondance with MB lining up with VT poorly when blocking them out, but I don't have the programming expertise nor the grunt time to grind out if there they line up more at certain points, priorities, or even values of Imp MB.  Would be an interesting excercise,  but amazingly difficult considering individual fight movement/other action requirements.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
This is just as incorrect as the other conceptualizations of SW:P by Althir.  You have zero chance of losing your MB damage in your example.  Your DPS will only be increased by keeping Pain up as much as possible.  Your baseline DPS is MB, while in the actual reality its MF, and your example does not take that into account, and that is why the logic doesn't translate.  Because MB has a cooldown, you will lose DPS if you cast less MB because of its cooldown.  This is why we are trying to quantify how many pain ticks it takes to get to the center of a Mind Blast.  The world may never know...<br>

</div>But this isn't true at all.  The fact that MB has a cooldown changes everything.  If MB had no cooldown then yes, you'd still apply SWP, because the decision would come down to one GCD -- which would either be the entire length of SWP, or one MB.  SWP clearly wins in that case.<br>

But with a 6 second cooldown on MB, if SWP has expired and your MB cooldown is up, the optimal choice is actually to cast MB first.  You're not choosing between the full duration of SWP and one MB.

</div>The choice is casting Mind Blast then Pain versus Pain then Mind Blast.  The cost of the first option is a loss of half a tick, but you don't gain a full mind blast in trade.  If you choose the second option, you'll still cast mind blast right after.  Starting the mind blast cooldown 1.5 seconds earlier is the ONLY benefit.  This is a benefit of Mind_Blast_Damage * 1.5 / Mind_Blast_Cooldown total damage.<br>
<br>
That said, half of a pain tick is what, 400 damage tops?  And a mind blast averages 3000 damage?  That's 600 damage (+300 net) with 4/5 improved blast, or 473 damage (+173 damage) with 0/5 improved blast.<br>
<br>
... Something about that makes me think my math is wrong, but I'm not sure how.  This case really shouldn't be so hard to model.  I am convinced it's better to cast Mind Blast instead of Shadow Word Pain when the timers for both are up, however.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_593786"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I did some rough modeling in Excel.  Again, just comparing which is better to cast first given a choice between SW:P and MB for maximum damage (ignoring for now VT, MF, and all the other considerations that ultimately make this something of a mute point but interesting none the less).<br>
<br>
It turns out my intial statement was wrong.  The cooldown does have an impact, specifically the length of the cooldown.  The problem with casting SW:P before 4/5 talented MB is that it sets up a recurring conflict: every time SW:P needs to be refreshed at the same time a MB cooldown is up.  So you are constantly pushing back a MB every 24 seconds.  Casting MB before SW:P results in a conflict only every 3rd SW:P.  Furthermore, if you ever choose to cast SW:P instead of MB you simply set in motion the conflict the next time SW:P needs to be cast.  In this limited case the theory does support casting a 4/5 talented MB before SW:P since it better sequences SW:P and MB recasts and leads to less "lost" casts.<br>
<br>
The scenario is different for a 5/5 talented MB.  In this case you never run into a conflict no matter which spell you start out with.  With no conflicts the DPS is essentially equal whether you start with MB or SW:P.  When I get a chance I'll model the casting sequence with the other MB cooldowns.<br>
<br>
I'll also try to remodel this situation taking VT into account to see what effect it has on the SW:P/MB conflicts.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_593927"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I apologize for my earlier post, I misread the dialogue apparently.<br>
<br>
I offer this instead:<br>
<br>
The only time this is pertinent is when the specific conflict in mind occurs:  SWP is falling off, and MB is cooled down.  For simplicity, I'm going to assume:<br>
25% crit chance<br>
Both these things occur at exactly the same time<br>
4/5 Improved Mind Blast (6 second standard CD)<br>
No lag<br>
<br>
Any other time you need to cast Mind Blast, you can do it immediately when it cools down, and any other time you need to refresh SWP you can do it without a problem.<br>
<br>
So, when the aforementioned problem occurs, there are two scenarios:<br>
1)  SWP first, MB second<br>
2)  MB first, SWP second<br>
<br>
1)  SWP Damage done over optimal time, 24 seconds -----&gt; MB done over sub-optimal time, 7.5 seconds.<br>
2)  MB Damage done over optimal time, 6 seconds -----&gt; SWP damage done over sub-optimal time, 25.5 seconds.<br>
<br>
In both cases, the time spent to cast both spells is 3 seconds, the time for the conflict's total damage to resolve itself is 31.5 seconds.  Subsequent Mind Blasts, Mind Flays, and VTs are immaterial.  Subsequent conflicts will follow the same logic; whichever choice was correct the first time is still correct.<br>
<br>
Excluding T6 bonuses, various talents and so on will not alter which choice is better:  it will merely compound it.  Percentage based increase in damage can't make a worse choice become better.<br>
So, my math:<br>
<br>
1) SWP first, MB second<br>
[(1812 + (24/15)d)] / 24 represents the DPS gained from the SWP.  [(805+(1.5/3.5)d) / 7.5]*1.125 represents the DPS gained from the Mind Blast, with a sub-par pcasting time 7.5 seconds.  d = spell damage<br>
<br>
2)  MB first, SWP second<br>
Same idea, switching which spell gains optimal cast times:<br>
[(1812 + (24/15)d)] / 25.5          &lt;--- SWP          [(805 + (1.5/3.5)d) / 6.0]*1.125            &lt;----MB<br>
<br>
Now, compare two functions S(d) [prefers SWP over MB] and M(d) [preferse MB over SWP]:<br>
<br>
S(d) = [75.5 + 0.066d] + [107.3 + .057d]*1.125<br>
M(d) = [71.05 + 0.062d] + [134.2 + .071d]*1.125<br>
<br>
We're interested in which scenario scales better with spelldamage.  That is, change in total damage with respect to spelldamage, or the first derivative with respect to spelldamage.<br>
<br>
S'(d) = .066 + (.057)(1.125)    = 0.13<br>
M'(d) = .062 + (.071)(1.125)    = 0.14<br>
<br>
So it seems that preferring Mind Blast will scale better with + damage in this simple scenario.  But at what +damage does this occur at?  Just set the original functions equal and solve for dama:<br>
<br>
[75.5 + 0.066d] + [107.3 + .057d]*1.125 = [71.05 + 0.062d] + [134.2 + .071d]*1.125<br>
<br>
I come up with <i>negative</i> 2350 spelldamage.  In other words, Mind Blast should take precedence <i>regardless of spell damage</i>.  The DPS contribution from 1.5 seconds of SWP will never outweigh the DPS contribution from Mind Blast, under any circumstances.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">MB is not over 6 seconds optimal and 7.5s suboptimal, it's 7.5s optimal and 9s suboptimal, as if MB's cooldown is 6 seconds you cannot cast MB more often than every 7.5s no matter how high you prioritize MB, since the cooldown only starts once the 1.5s cast is complete. So if your math is actually correct beyond that point, you're over-evaluating the usefullness of MB.</div>

	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>You're right, but the conclusion remains BECAUSE:<br>
<br>
SWP is diminished by dividing by 25.5 instead of 24, while MB is diminished by dividing by 9 instead of 7.5; in otherwords, the change in denominator in the equation determines which suffers greater DPS loss as a result of being delayed.  Still Mind Blast.  Mind Blast still takes priority.<br>

</div>No, but I can predict that if you prioritize 5 shadow word pains over 5 mind blasts you'll have lost 7.5 seconds on your mind blast cooldown over the course of a fight.  That means you've definitely lost one full blast, no matter when the boss dies.  In this case, you traded 7.5 seconds of pain ticks for that blast.  If mana is no concern, this is only worth doing when your mind blast deals 7.5/3 = 2.5 times as much as your pain ticks.<br>
<br>
Well, my mind blast is more than 2500 on average and my shadow word pain ticks are less than 1000.  I think my math was right after all.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I still agree with this.  Each time you choose SWP over MB is a theoretical DPS loss, although that loss is not actualized until the fight has gone long enough for you to <i>lose</i> a MB.  On fights of Some Particular Length That Would Be Hard To Determine(tm), it would not matter, but that wouldn't justify incorrectly prioritizing SWP over MB. <br>
<br>
On trash, it is possible that SWP should take priority, because it is possible that you could lose a tic of SWP by casting it second, when you would not lose a MB by casting <i>it</i> second.  That's what I am going to roll with for now, anyway.<br>
<br>
On a humorous aside, as far as I can tell, one of the main reasons MB is better to prioritize is the extra damage availability from crits... since we all love spell crit so much...<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_594545"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->From what I have read here, it is a case of six versus 2 x three.  <br>
<br>
Irrespective of how you prioritise, commonly held belief is that VT-&gt;MB-&gt;SW:P-&gt;SWD-&gt;MF is the best priority to hold to.<br>
<br>
Where the court is out, still, is whether it is worthwhile 'clipping' flay in order to reapply DoTs or whether it is best to let your Spell finish.  There was a saying pre-BC when I was a healer that 'healing is an art, while dps is a science' and I think that this holds true almost everywhere but for Shadow Priests.<br>
<br>
Everything is situational, what spell you cast and when will change 100% dependant on the variables of a given fight.<br>
<br>
There are, I think, 2 fights in T6 content where I can stand still and Nuke.  Other than that, I am running around, avoiding environmental damage and generally trying to stay alive.  SWP vs MB is an arguement between DPM and DPS, for &lt; 1200 Damage priests for whom longevity while nuking is a problem, SW:P has to take priority, as MB is not a mana efficient spell.<br>
<br>
It takes ~2200 damage to become 'mana neutral' which is not currently achievable even with optimal group composition and the best +damage gear available. (Ele Shaman, 3xBM Hunter)<br>
<br>
I'm still intrigued by Spell Haste, (Necromancy of topic) and whether it has yet been accurately modelled.  It's something that I can identify several challenges with the maths of, as the benefit of haste varies incredibly for SPs depending on Spec, gear, grouping, rotations ...<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yes, absolutely.  There is no discussion around the fact that gear is constantly interchangable.  More Stamina, More Damage, More Mana/5, SR, I hold about 6 configurations of gear that take me through a weeks raiding in MH and BT.  Mainly because the healers shout at me if I have &lt; 10k buffed HP.<br>

</div>I actually built that set, minus the staff, and went back to normal spell damage gear.  However, I've been working on a different set lately: spell penetration.  Sadly it's only useful on Illidari council, but last week I swapped in my PvP wand and noticed good results.  I'm thinking of getting a spare nethervoid cloak with penetration enchant and using it with the PvP wand, offhand, and the Hyjal penetration shoulders for another 80 penetration or so.  Combined with Curse of Shadows, this should reduce Galthos' shadow resistance to around 80 (counting curse of shadows) when his magic resistance aura is up.  Seems worth losing 50 spell damage and 2% threat reduction.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_596136"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Just a few questions, I didn't see them answered elsewhere in the topic, my apologies if they have been.<br>
<br>
Firstly, is there any advantage to taking 1/5 Imp. MB over 4/5? I'd like to be able to work Silence into my build and the original post mentioned 1/5 is viable, but in what way? Is it a latency issue (I usually run about 200ms, if that makes a difference) or is it simply playstyle?<br>
<br>
My other question regards Improved Shadow Bolt. We're not at a particularly high gear level, but we still run with 2 Destruction Warlocks with about 20% crit each (I think 25% after the talents). One is hit capped, the other is still working at it and is at about 11%. Especially on the nights where we only have one Destro Lock, I've been asked to stop using Mind Blast and Shadow Word Death so as to preserve ISB uptime, as my DoTs can still tick through it and the Destro Lock can utilize the charges for himself. Is it worth losing my DPS (and my mana output) to preserve ISB uptime in these situations, or is it more important to keep MB and SWD on cooldown no matter what?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_596149"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->That sounds like playing to the DMs to me. 20% more damage means 20% more mana for them, in addition to the fact that they lose out on additional mana if you stick to a mind flay rotation.

		<div id="post_message_596230"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->To be fair, using 4 charges on spell with base 4000 damage is better than 4 charges on base 2000 damage spells, and yes, eating up the last ISB charge will be a net loss of damage if the Warlock can't refresh the debuff in three casts (9 seconds).  It's not so much padding damage meters as...  The warlock can't "not cast shadow bolt" and get improved shadow bolt up.  Given that this direct damage spell is non-negotiable, it seems best to cut others.  If-- and this is a big if-- doing so would increase raid damage.<br>
<br>
The other question is whether all four charges are likely to get used before the buff is refreshed again.  If there is only one charge left, in your situation I wouldn't cast Shadow Word Death.  If there were four, I would.  So the real answer depends heavily on his crit rating and the number of warlocks in the raid.  With 2 or more warlocks, I'd never stop.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, doing this on the fly analysis of ISB charges while you also have to track your threat, mana, interfering DoT cooldowns, and whatever is going on in the fight is a pain.  It seems likely thinking this hard would just cause you to make mistakes.  I know it would for me.  Those mistakes would probably cause a greater damage loss that would be gained through increased ISB uptime.  So it does smell of damage meter padding to me.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_596530"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Considering the huge dps difference of SWD/MB over MF, and considering the fact that when you click the button to cast the spell you don't really know how many ISB charges will be on the boss when the spell is actually cast, due to latency+reaction time, say with 200ms and lightning-fast brain you will have a total delay of 0.4 seconds between your decision to cast the spell and the spell to actually cast, with 1.5s extra for MB due to casting time - I would highly doubt it would be a good idea to adjust your rotation based on the number of ISB charges on the target or anything of that sort.

		<div id="post_message_600574"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->i manage to make my gear selfbufed with 1454 shadow dmg and i use 1/5 shadow focus so have 4/5 imp mind blast with 5/5 crit talent , mana reg is helpfull but with this amout of spell dmg raid buffed with shaman and shadow pot i have around 1650 spell dmg so mana is endless anyway on encounter like ilidari for example , last reset i gave back to my party 57k mana i don`t see the point to say we are not dps class ;0 i am in top 5 on most of ecounter allways first on ilidan etc , so just go max spell dmg i play raid gear with 33% crit unufed so raid bufed i get around 36% my spell rottation is like<br>
<br>
1 - swp<br>
2 - vt<br>
3 - wd<br>
4 mb<br>
5 mf<br>
6 mf<br>
7 mb<br>
8 mf<br>
9 vt (interupt mf when 1.6 sec left on vt,cuz of lag so can land on boss exactly when expire)<br>
and again just if needed put VE , but with it i make too much agro on encounter like ros for exaple and on blodboil so is up to u when to use it <br>
<br>
i use WD on cd rly helps some shadow priest are saying to me when i don`t use it is more dmg , but mf cand`t do dmg like wd for sure and if crit is 3.5-4k depend of the boss so mindflay can`t cover even non crit 1,7-2k of wd P<br>
<br>
there is calculation make on teorycraft<br>
<br>
<br>
When we calculate we use these values &amp; this template: <br>
<br>
* 6.14 crit rating = 1 dmg (with SW in rotation) <br>
* 10 haste = 5.08 spelldmg (presuming ~1400 dmg) <br>
* 10 spirit = 1.1 dmg (1 dmg without kings with imp DS) <br>
* 70 int = 1 crit = ~3.85 dmg (3.5 dmg without kings) <br>
* dmg + crit/6.14 + int*0.055 + spirit*0.11 + haste*.508 + sockets [+12 gems] + meta [Mystical Skyfire Diamond]<br>
<br>
so we can see spell dmg &gt;&gt;&gt; all just cap u hit with gear or with talents i prefer with gear and then is not a prob to have mix spec  to no respect when doing pvp 14/0/47 ,with fear imp and silence , no improved VE , and 4/5 or 5/5 mb depend of how talents u need on shadow focus i am using 1/5 cuz playing with crit gear and have 14.87% hit from gear, if use 4/5 t6 0/5 shadow focus<br>

</div>Int is worthless.  Crit is almost completely worthless, on the order of 8 crit rating = 1 spell damage or worse.  This is true even while leveling.  Just wear enough stamina to survive and otherwise max out on shadow wrath gear while leveling.<br>
<br>
Improved Vampiric Embrace is really a question of how often you're casting mind blast.  If you will cast mind blast often enough to keep it on cooldown even with 4/5 improved mind blast, you should drop improved vampiric embrace.  But at early gear level, you don't have enough spell damage to maintain that kind of longevity, so improved mind blast is wasted.  That means the points are better spent in improved vampiric embrace.  I suspect this will be true until you have most of the useful gear from Kara.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Right now (at least until I get VT at 50 woooo hooooooo) I've been stacking mainly int and then dmg and healing where I can get it.  I was mainly concerned with whether or not to get rid of pure stat items <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=7713" target="_blank">[Illusionary Rod]</a> for just dmghealing items like <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=7721" target="_blank">[Hand of Righteousness]</a> + an offhand or better, since crit/int isnt as important as pure dmg and healing. <br>
<br>
Any other tips for low levels spriests solo leveling? Most of the information in here for end-game (save the excellent pre-kara list of items), so I'm hoping maybe some new information.<br>
<br>
Also, you mentioned the "of Shadow Wrath".  Are those, item point for point worth more than the greens and blues I'll get from questing/instances just because they are pure shadow dmg? (note: I level alone, in mostly a level or two above areas to try and keep the XP flowing and actually give me a challange as to get my caster skills up..rogue at heart)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_601617"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->When leveling, you want spirit first and damage second.  Stamina is the only other stat that matters...and it doesn't matter all that much.  Stacking Spirit will reduce your downtime to zero and allow you to constantly chain cast.  Remember, Spirit Tap always gives the same amount of mana, even while casting.<br>
<br>
Edit: Althir, can you run your numbers with a 9 second cooldown on Mind Blast (aka only 1 point in Improved Mind Blast).  I'm not sure if your method is correct, but I'm curious to see what you get with a 9 second cooldown.  In the meantime, I'll try to deciper your math.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_602597"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->My SP is my alt that has only recently made it to 70. while rushing to get to the magic mark I largely ignored gearing up through runs because the all wanted me to heal them.<br>
<br>
I already had an idea of what gear to look for having another shadow class as my main ( i know why bother right? but its fun)<br>
Looking through your posting helped steer me to a few items i might otherwise not have thought of but I also notice a few items that could be added  if one is not a crafter, or if the want alternatives.<br>
<br>
For wands the control rod from arc is by far best blue.  I would actually rather have it than the black stalk, though the witchdoctors if gemmed correctly wins the battle.<br>
<br>
For chest.. if you can not make the fsw set (I did this on my lock. I really cant see me leveling tailoring again)<br>
the warp infused drape from bot is a good blue for SP <br>
<br>
If you don't want to run heroic sl for th kirin tor pants .. devil stitched are best blues.. the gem slots leave it open to many options depending on what stat you are lacking.<br>
<br>
Quite a few nice heroic drops available as well and since you now only need heroic rep to get the keys it is easier to get groups to go.<br>
Demonfang ritual helm<br>
grand scepter of nex kings in her mt <br>
boots of blashphemy from her pens<br>
Kirin tor legs from slabs<br>
and belt of depravity from her arc.<br>
<br>
<br>
There are quite a few nice drops with good spell hit out there, sadly they seem to have a lower drop rate.  I am looking forward to all the rep I will get while grinding instances for these drops.<br>
<br>
<br>

</div>The shaman, by far.  101 Spell damage is roughly 45 extra DPS.  Even with full uptime and 1300 DPS, 3% extra damage is only gives 39 extra damage.

				<div style="font-style:italic">Just a few questions, I didn't see them answered elsewhere in the topic, my apologies if they have been.<br>
<br>
Firstly, is there any advantage to taking 1/5 Imp. MB over 4/5? I'd like to be able to work Silence into my build and the original post mentioned 1/5 is viable, but in what way? Is it a latency issue (I usually run about 200ms, if that makes a difference) or is it simply playstyle?<br>
<br>
My other question regards Improved Shadow Bolt. We're not at a particularly high gear level, but we still run with 2 Destruction Warlocks with about 20% crit each (I think 25% after the talents). One is hit capped, the other is still working at it and is at about 11%. Especially on the nights where we only have one Destro Lock, I've been asked to stop using Mind Blast and Shadow Word Death so as to preserve ISB uptime, as my DoTs can still tick through it and the Destro Lock can utilize the charges for himself. Is it worth losing my DPS (and my mana output) to preserve ISB uptime in these situations, or is it more important to keep MB and SWD on cooldown no matter what?</div>

I understand that Destruction Warlocks and Mages will scale better, since most or all of their spells scale directly with haste.  We only have one spell out of five that scales with haste, and we just use it as filler between our more powerful spells.<br>

</div>Well I thought the math post explained it.  All that matters is the percent of time you spend casting a hastable spell and the DPS of whatever spell you cast when everything else is on cooldown.  While it's true that a hasted mind flay doesn't help if Mind blast still has .3 seconds on cooldown, it helps immensely if pre-haste the cooldown would have been up for .3 seconds, since post haste it's ready on time.  The math in question ignores these interactions except to note that they are complicated and every cycle has some time values where a certain amount of haste will help more than the average and other values where it helps less than average.  However, the actual value (hastable time * haste percent * mind flay DPS) is indeed the average, ignoring these interactions.  It is NOT the maximum.<br>
<br>
If the equations aren't making things clear, perhaps working through some examples with actual values would help?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Well if things were balanced well, no more than one copy of each class/spec combo (27 total) would be justified in a 25 man raid.  And as people gear up more, DPS increases which means longevity is less of an issue, so there's less reward from mana regeneration.<br>
<br>
I believe the primary shift was from the 2.3 patch making fire mages better than arcane, as a fire mage can last a lot longer without a shadow priest.  Shadow priests are only useful when 3 or 4 other people in the raid have enough mana dumps to otherwise run out of mana, and quite frankly, there aren't enough mana dumps.  Even Arcane Blast is less than Fireball for fire mages, I believe.<br>
<br>
The flip side of adding more mana dumps is that PvP could get imbalanced by giving classes more burst damage, so it's a tricky bit of game design to balance.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<!-- message -->
		<div id="post_message_606731"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The main problem with current shadow priest theorycrafting, as I see it - is the reduction in value of what haste is worth.  I personally - and I believe Elegen  would also agree with me on this particular topic - believe haste is the scaling answer necessary for shadow priests.  You're probably asking *why* haste?  Haste does not effect mind blast.  Haste does not effect our dots, or shadow word death.  So why would you want any haste?  <br>
<br>
Look at it from this standpoint - our highest DPS spell is obviously mindblast.  We want to use that *every* time it's up - simply because, if your average mindblast is something like 3000, that's 2000dps.  Not too shabby, but on a fairly long cooldown.  SW is even longer.  SW:P and VT have even *longer* cooldowns if you look at it from that standpoint.<br>
<br>
So in a normal rotation, that leaves us with quite a large amount of filler space.  Our filler spell is mindflay - which is quite low dps in comparison to the other options we would have if they were not currently on cooldown.   The problem is primarily with the scale factor for mindflay as well as the fact that there is no possible crit component.  Being that you reach ~30crit to mindblast/SW:D with BT gear (not going out of your way to stack crit, using the talents) - there's very little reason to go beyond that particular crit level.  Stacking +dmg has a small dps increase since well - mindflay's coefficient is quite lacking.<br>
<br>
Obviously, if you've read what I wrote or have any clue of how shadow priests function - you can sort of argue that mindflay is bleeding +dmg due to the poor nature of the spell.<br>
<br>
However, let's make the case that mindflay was reduced from 3.0s to say, an easily achievable 2.7s.  Assuming you were doing say, 563 average unbuffed (no misery, etc) per tick using 1400+dmg- we'll reduce it to something like 550, which is ~1351 dmg.  <br>
<br>
So, (550 * 3) / 2.7 = 611.111111<br>
563*3/3 = well, 563 :P.<br>
<br>
So we got a 48dps increase on our low dps, filler spell while dropping it down by 23dmg on average...\<br>
<br>
That's assuming we give up 49dmg to achieve this amount of haste.<br>
<br>
Btw, we lose 4.36100dps from SW:P going to 1351 dmg, 4.75300dps from VT.  So maybe 10dps lost for a 48dps increase, so a 38dps increase.  <br>
<br>
I can do more exact numbers based on the gear that's available at the moment and such, and will sometime quite soon - but I figured I'd throw this out so everyone can argue and debate about it - but the way we are really looking at things, I think - is fundamentally wrong.  The issue with trying to improve shadow priest dps is to try and improve the weakest link - not bolster what is already above average.  We're stuck with mindflay - and no amount of crit is going to help that.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>That's actually something that I've been wondering.  Since our guild acquired a retribution paladin, our second shadow priest now goes to healers instead of DPS most of the time, and even then we are just swapping healers in and out since their mana doesn't move much with a shadow priest unless it's Mother Shahraz, Gurtogg or Illidari Council.

				<div style="font-style:italic">That's actually something that I've been wondering.  Since our guild acquired a retribution paladin, our second shadow priest now goes to healers instead of DPS most of the time, and even then we are just swapping healers in and out since their mana doesn't move much with a shadow priest unless it's Mother Shahraz, Gurtogg or Illidari Council.   We used to fret when our second shadow priest didn't show up to a raid, but now it's much less of a big deal than it used to be.   <br>

If I can dig them up (if they are still active), Elegen and I have some breaking 1500dps on gorefiend (which isn't necessarily the nicest fight due to pushbacks).  We are possibly lower on some fights then desirable - but there are some fights in which we can also do quite well in comparison (Illidan, Archimonde, nearly all of Hyjal).  The fights where we are primarily rather weak are ones like Council due to resists and lack of debuffs (Warlocks are worrying more about Tongues then keeping isb up for example).  On some of the shorter fights, Jurbtwo and I have gotten close to 1600dps (like Rage Winterchill).  Our sustained dps drops sharply when there are environmental factors (sleep, freezing) that cause us to only have dots tick whereas mages/warlocks do not have those issues unless they are fire mages (it's more that we have 100% uptime, which doesn't necessarily mean both dots or ticking or that we are fulltime dpsing, whereas for a destruction lock, 100% uptime indicates that they are casting shadowbolt exactly in succession one after another 100% of the time).<br>
<br>
In the end, total dmg is what matters - not necessarily sustained dps since various things can really affect that number adversely for any dot class.<br>
<br>
The real question for shadow priests is - at our upper limit (which seems to be about 1500dps on fights where you can actually tell a sustained dps value since movement fights lower our sustained values due to dots still ticking and recount/wws not being able to really garner any useful information regarding that) - are shadow priests still worth it?  5% overall caster damage, 10% more on top of that to warlocks, and a mana battery (which may be less significant now, but could once again become significant during progression) leads me to believe - yes.  They are more a tool to help progression more then anything.  Passive healing, mana regen, dps buffs, etc.  turn them into one of the most useful classes to have around.  We may outgear Black Temple and Hyjal, but there's really no telling what tax there will be on healers and dps in Sunwell.<br>
<br>
Basically, even though they may not "scale" as well (although I've been experimenting with best practices and methods to improve scaling) - it's hard to imagine going into any kind of progression without at least 2 shadow priests.<br>
<br>
That said, it'd be nice to have mindflay scale much better.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Previous week, 1355 DPS without CoS:  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080421092627/http://wowwebstats.com/zevjvadgdzdj1?s=5376-5551" target="_blank">Wow Web Stats</a><br>

This is with +1356 shadow damage unbuffed, then using oil, food, and elixir of major shadow power.   Maybe next week I'll get a Rage where I don't have to move out of D&amp;D at all and dont get ice bolted.   Generally for the first 3 bosses in Hyjal I run 1300-1400 DPS.  With all that said, I don't think there's any worry about shadow priests going the way of the dodo, the ancillary benefits we bring to the raid and our group are still very valuable.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I've been wondering for a while now how long it would be before how poorly our DPS scales began to outweigh our utility to the raid.  Unless the future is filled with encounters like the Illidari Council, I can see this attitude becoming more prevalent with respect to shadow priests.</div>

</div>If you're running into a situation where your mages and healers do not need shadow priests, stick them with your warlocks.  Our DPS jumps quite a bit as you save us GCDs, and we'll never be mana-efficient enough to not need the mana.  That may not be the solution for ZA woes, but it will certainly help out in a 25 man raid.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I'm with Nikita on this issue.  Due to the nature of progression content, and the advent of our 41 point talent, we could do 800 dps, and still guarantee 2-3 dedicated raid spots to spriests for conquering content.  The mana per5, caster damage buff, and off healing are just far too invaluable to just replace with someone who can do more damage.  I, unlike many shadowpriests, actually don't believe that we necessarily need any damage buffs as is.  Though the thought of us being able to compete with other dps classes seems like a pleasant idea, it seems unnecessary.  Our position in the raid is as a utility class, no longer a top end dps class (largely attributed to the death change, as well as shadow weaving).  As is, my dps is high enough (as well as my regen) that I use less than 5 super mana pots in a full BT clear, and that is largely without a shaman.  At the endgame gear level, if I'm not mistaken, most of us will primarily use destruction potions, just to push dps and raid regen further.<br>
<br>
Keep in mind Nikita, the dps you, Elegan and many other shadowpriests are putting out isn't all necessarily due to haste.  I feel it's necessary to point this out, due to the fact that the end dps number sharply decreases with time outside the trinket use windows, and comes back up a bit with the bloodlust phase.  However, if you down bosses in less than 2-3 mins, comparing yourself to people who kill the boss in 5 mins is a rather unfair comparison.  Higher raid dps (and assuming ideal group composition for you) will net you a higher personal dps time overall.  By example: I myself check wws parses rather religiously, and during progression phases for hyjal, though my gear remained largely the same, the fact that we killed the boss faster simply though comfort levels netted a higher dps.  Pulling 1100 dps on a first kill, then less than 2 weeks later with no extra gear hitting 1300.  Not to mention the wws parses of the kill times nearly halving, which seems to yield a clear net dps increase for the entire raid.  <br>
<br>
Anyway, more on point, stacking haste is largely unnecessary beyond getting mind flay to approx 2.75s.  Generally where most haste pieces go, there is a more suitable piece, if I'm not mistaken the generally accepted slots to stack haste are the ring slots, weapon, bracers, and the skull of guldan.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_607915"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Nikita put it pretty well.  One misconception I see within other posts is that 142 spell haste with 2.75s mind flays is optimal for a haste set.  The reality is that 199 haste with 2.66s MF and 1.33s MB fits the two mindflay 5/5 imp MB model perfectly due to the GCD disparity with MB.  <br>
<br>
I agree that there are a lot of factors outside of gear choice, but we see that the haste builds are at least on par with pure damage builds.  Another priest in my guild expressed regret over taking mostly pure damage gear after his damage wasn't keeping up with mine.  As he adds more haste pieces our DPS chart numbers are getting closer.  I'm hesitant to draw conclusions based on comparing different raids out of guild since makeup and warlock:spriest ratio can skew the numbers greatly, but in doing so I try to look at all of the factors involved.  Comparing priests within one raid is much easier to analyze.<br>
<br>
Another factor we must consider is scaling.  After raid buffs, the spell damage ratio between the two builds is lowered to between a  5-7% difference by my estimates.  This seems very minimal compared to what you gain with haste.  The value is diminished further when you consider that the bulk of our damage is derived from spells that have less than 100% coefficient after talents and raid buffs.  Much of haste's value will depend on Sunwell and WotLK itemization.  If haste gear is allowed to scale in damage close behind pure damage pieces, then haste will become a more attractive stat.  If haste's damage stats end up falling too far behind then they will lose their worth.  <br>
<br>
As I see it right now, haste edges out a pure damage build in most end game fights, but not by much.  There still are some fights, like Azgalor and Archimonde, that give preference to pure damage builds due to excessive down time.  Hopefully we will get a peak at 2.4 gear soon to help determine the future of the stat.  Right now haste's future is in Blizzard's hands.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>You'll have to quantify why you consider an item "best in slot."  If you use the 0.4-0.6 haste per spell damage ratio, then these items fall right in with their pure damage counterparts.  The items you have listed give 177 spell haste for a 2.7s MF and 1.35s MB.  I personally wear the ZA neck to top the 199 mark.

		<div id="post_message_609128"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I am not what you would call a 'math oriented' guy but, anecodotally (if that's even a word), from my own experience using Illidan staff, crafted bracers, ZA boots, and one haste trash ring, I wasn't impressed with the numbers.  Granted, that was with about fifty or so less +haste than what is now being touted as the ideal but I still remain skeptical.<br>
<br>
As Hope said, though, I would like to see a controlled test on Doctor Boom or whatever where everything is equal save for the swapping of the haste gear.  WWS reports from raids only go so far because there are a lot of variables such as the presence or absence of an elemental shaman (or any shaman at all), BM hunter, how many warlocks you have with improved shadow bolt, etc.  My gear isn't even completely maxed out (lacking ZA trinket, etc) but I can hit 1450+ DPS fully raid buffed without much difficulty.  That's not to say that 1500+ isn't better just that it might not be a matter of the gear itself and merely raid/group composition and/or reflexes... and I'm sure the Skull of Gul'dan plays a large role in that and shouldn't be considered 'haste' for purposes of the passive haste itemization debate.<br>
<br>
All of that said, and to respond to the larger issue of shadow priest scaling, I would certainly hope Blizzard does something in the expansion by way of new spells and talents to ramp up the damage output of a shadow priest.  One will always be fairly important for the mob debuffs alone.  The main issue is will the mana return still be viable enough to justify taking a second over DPS classes that scale a lot better.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_609138"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Well, with a new expansion comes new spells with higher mana costs. Right now a lot of us are sitting at a point where, in t6 gear, and with the recent regeneration changes, mana isn't hard to come by for any class really. Unfortunately the specs that really would <i>need</i> a Shadow Priest such as an Arcane Mage or Marksman Hunter for example, are considered to be inferior raiding specs by most people. We're still spectacular for our debuffs, and mana return on longevity fights (few and far between in TBC raiding). It's also worth noting that when Shadow Priests were competitive on damage charts, we had access to T5 equivalent gear through crafting, whereas, most other classes' gear has scaled somewhat linearly from level 61 blues and greens through T6 gear and therefore their DPS has consistently increased at a steady rate.<br>
<br>
As for haste gear, I'm still not convinced. I am a math kind of person and I've yet to see someone present some hard numbers that show they're actually gaining an extra MB or MF anywhere in their casting cycle that would show how stacking haste gear would be a direct increase in DPS. As of now, I see a benefit from being able to fit 2 hasted MF's into a 5/5 MB rotation. Other than that, extra haste seems to be completely wasted due to our CD/channeling limitations alone. Even then, the fact that it can only apply to ~50% of our damage (even then 50% of that is an incidental increase due to lowering of MB's cooldown) still leaves me quite leery of the true benefits.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>To be fair, in a raid setting you'd have more spell damage buffs: flasks, food, oil, and totem will add to 80+23+42+101 = 246 spell damage.  While at 1321 spell damage, 1 haste = .5 spell damage, at 1567 spell damage you might get better results.  Still just in the .55 to .6 range though.<br>
<br>
At any rate, I'm not convinced the intangible benefits of haste against a mobile boss are enough to make spell haste better than the estimates.  Keep in mind that spell damage is relatively better against mobile bosses because your DoTs get full damage even if you can't cast you direct damage spells on them for a moment.  In other words, in every situation haste <b>might</b> make you finish your mind flay fast enough for one last tick, extra spell damage <b>will</b> make pain and touch tick for extra damage.<br>
<br>
Regarding pushback, there are few fights where this is an issue.  And if it is, you either get concentration aura and earth shield or your damage is in the gutter.  A little bit of spell haste doesn't affect your damage that much.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_610675"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Maelovia: The talent your friend is referring to is Shadow Focus (tier 2, shadow) which reduces your targets chance to resist your Shadow spells by up to 10%, the talent isn't worded around "hit rating" so it can be confusing. In basic terms, speccing 5/5 Shadow Focus will increase your hit rating to 10%, now the maximum effective hit rating for any caster is 16%, so shadow priests get 10% from talents and we need the other 6% from our gear. 76 hit rating is the 6% we need so you still need to maintain a minimum of 76 hit on your gear as well as 5/5 Shadow Focus.<br>

Looking over your spec, you need 10 more points in discipline for Meditation and Inner Focus.  At first glance, you can easily cut 3 from Spirit Tap, 3 from Silence, 1 from Improved Mind Blast, 2 from Vampiric Embrace, and 1 from Shadow Weaving to get those 10 points.  I'd highly recommend moving 5 points from Blackout to Spirit Tap at low gear levels as well, but it's really a point of personal preference.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Also consider the warlock to shadow priest ratio with a shadow priest dying early and one warlock having 40% shadowbolt crit.  The shadow priest that topped 1500 only had to DPS for about 2:45, meaning they had trinkets and lust active for an atypical proportion of the fight.  The priest probably activated trinkets at the very beginning, and at a little after 2:20 their second round of trinkets finished.  Moments later they died and locked in their DPS number.<br>
<br>
What does all of this tell us?  Well, shadow priests scale poorly no matter what we do.  No numbers I have seen can fully negate either spec.  With such subtle differences and so many uncontrollable variables I don't think we will see a definite answer in the short term.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_612155"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Thank you so much for the talent build information, I did the respec last night using the first page of this thread.  My sustained dps jumped by over 250dps! I was amazed at the difference it made, thank you.<br>
<br>
I also discovered that recap does a horrible job of keeping track of my dps, it counts casting time, that doesn't matter if I'm buffing the group or mind controlling a mob, recount seems to be a better damage meter.  Is there a setting I'm missing? Recap was awesome as a heal meter I'm surprised it did so poorly with dps.  <br>
<br>
Dotsdotsdots was helpful as well but I'm looking for another mod.  I would like to be able to bubble party members without breaking from my focus target.  I can do it without dropping the heal cast using mods like healbot but when it comes to dps I am yet again at a loss.  The tricky part of this equation is that I'm a mousless player so simple mouseover macros aren't as helpful.<br>
<br>
I hope I'm not derailing the haste vs spell dmg argument here, its awesome to see you be so passionate about your game play.   This just seemed the most likely thread as it is a "how to" thread.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_612413"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I did Teron last night in my standard high spell damage suit (with two timer trinkets-- <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33829" target="_blank">[Hex Shrunken Head]</a> and <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=29370" target="_blank">[Icon of the Silver Crescent]</a>).  The fight was around 3:45, so I barely got two Devouring Plagues in.  The guild web parse hasn't been loaded yet, but I hit 1259 DPS... Which sounds terrible until I mention the following factors:<br>
<br>
- No curse of shadows (only one warlock, who correctly did recklessness)<br>
- No wrath of air totem or bloodlust<br>
- Lower Improved Shadow Bolt uptime from only having one warlock<br>
- No drums<br>
<br>
Other than that, I had full consumable and concentration aura.  I don't think I got an Earth Shield, but I really don't remember.<br>
<br>
At any rate, adding a maledicted Curse of Shadows alone would be 13% extra damage, up to 1423 DPS.  So I'm not convinced that haste is the cause of the WWS parses you linked.  Hoping to do a haste test of the encounter next week.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_612539"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I also think it's worth mentioning that spell haste works to negate or reduce the effect of push back on the Teron fight. I believe this has already been mentioned but it's possible that having a haste set for fights with push back, and a damage set for fights without, might end up being the answer to "which is best and when?". If I had a haste set I'd do the test as well. Unfortunately I only have the Infinity belt and the haste boots/neck from ZA. I don't have a trash drop ring, nor Illy staff so it wouldn't really be a quality comparison because a lot of the items still wouldn't be best in slot. Hell, my damage set still isn't quite complete yet either.<br>

Maelovia, I'd recommend trying Assessment. I used recount but it gathers so much data that it really bogged down my old system. I haven't switched back since I've gotten used to Assessment, but it does a great job with the Average Instant DPS module, it usually turns out to be very close to a WWS parse. Also, have you tried using a simple /targetlasttarget macro for what you're trying to accomplish with shielding?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_612885"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'm a complete idiot when it comes to macros.  /Targetlasttarget will only put me back to the main assist for shielding right? Oh no, that will give me whoever the mob is currently targeting won't it?  That actually might work and I could key bind it.  Could I do something like /targetlasttarget cast power word: shield?  I'm not sure that would work but I'm hoping you get the general idea, then I could use a single button to cast the bubble and hit my assist key to get right back to dps.  What I'm finding now is that bubbles are taking me away from dps for too long.  I will go find assessment to download right now. Thanks again, I'll have something helpful to post instead of leeching information eventually.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

You actually don't even see yourself target anyone but your current target. I'm not sure how you are targeting people that you want to shield in the first place though. I've never tried to play without a mouse. You could drop the first line from that macro and target the person(using whatever you use to target), in that case it would cast PWS and then target the mob again for DPS.

</div>If all you want to do is PW:S whomever the target is beating on, than a simple.<br>
<br>
/cast [help] [target=targettarget, help] [target=player] Power Word:Shield<br>
<br>
Should do the trick. If your target is friendly it will cast it on them. If your target is an enemy it will cast it on its target. It will also cast the spell on yourself should you have no target. However, be sure to make a binding that casts PW:S on yourself, as dropping your target to self shield is also a waste of time.<br>
<br>
/cast [target=player] Power Word:Shield<br>
<br>
If you want to cast PW:S on a person in the raid w/o losing your target. (A person not getting beat on by your target) I would suggest looking into clique casting and your raid frame of choice.<br>
<br>
My question has to do with mindflay. Are most of you just using quartz and timing a new flay when it enters the red? <br>
<br>
I tried nochannel recently, and it seems the nochannel option is checking client side and not allowing me to request a new flay early. (spell not ready message even when deep in the lag (red) portion of quartz)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

The fight was around 3:45, so I barely got two Devouring Plagues in.  The guild web parse hasn't been loaded yet, but I hit 1259 DPS... Which sounds terrible until I mention the following factors:<br>
<br>
- No curse of shadows (only one warlock, who correctly did recklessness)<br>
- No wrath of air totem or bloodlust<br>
- Lower Improved Shadow Bolt uptime from only having one warlock<br>
- No drums<br>
<br>
Other than that, I had full consumable and concentration aura.  I don't think I got an Earth Shield, but I really don't remember.<br>
<br>
At any rate, adding a maledicted Curse of Shadows alone would be 13% extra damage, up to 1423 DPS.  So I'm not convinced that haste is the cause of the WWS parses you linked.  Hoping to do a haste test of the encounter next week.</div>

</div>My point was just that the parse of Intricacy seemed particularly low for that gear set, not that my data was the gold standard.  And I agree that when we only cast 25 crittable spells in our 3 minute encounter, there's a lot of room for variance.  3 minutes isn't exactly a large sample set.<br>
<br>
What would be the best way to test haste gear versus damage gear then?  Blow a few mana bars on Dr. Boom while fully consumabled but otherwise unbuffed?  One potential problem is that unless you have improved vampiric embrace, you probably won't do enough damage to heal up your Shadow Word: Death hits, especially if you get two crits in a row.

</div>Did I miss where Elegen posted a WWS? I'm assuming you guys are talking about Nikitabananas post? I'm sort of confused at the moment. 61 MF ticks does seem a bit low but... looking at the WWS I posted Amorela had 67 MF ticks @ 1505 DPS and I had 71 ticks at 1487 DPS. I mean, the benefit of haste is more MF ticks, it would seem obvious to me that someone stacking haste would have quite a few more MF's than someone who is stacking damage. There are quite a bit of factors on the Teron fight that do skew the data, and as Elegen noted, raid composition plays a big part as well. We did have 3 warlocks for that kill versus 2 for Nikitas. There is also a gear disparity there. I'm at least 4 (really 5 but that piece is sitting in my bank because I want to keep the 4 piece bonus) pieces short of my perfect gear, where Nikita alluded to being a single piece shy. No two teron fights are nearly the same either. Every single time a different person will be dropped from the raid at different times during the fight, that variable alone is going to cause a problem for testing.<br>
<br>
I think the real answer to find out which gear options are better, at least in a vacuum, would be to take all the necessary debuffers and the proper group composition to Dr. Boom and fire away. That would be at least a somewhat standardized test. Unfortunately, a Dr. Boom test is far from a "real world" fight. There are no fights where one simply stands and shoots. As I said a few posts ago, I think we're going to find that on fights where there is spell pushback, haste gear is going to come out on top, and fights where there is movement, straight damage gear will.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Since I have both gearsets (other then zhar'doom for haste), and do have every best item for straight shadow dmg stacking - I'll go to Dr. Boom today and a number of dps tries using just self buffs (no cos or isb) and see what the different dps comparisons are.  You can argue that isb should scale uniformly regardless of what spells you cast - but in reality that's not necessarily true.  However, I think in reality it's close enough for this.  <br>

		<div id="post_message_613851"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Teron is probably the best, but still obviously imperfect for a lot of reasons.   I figure I can top out at 1600 DPS when everything breaks right, and that's with +1356 shadow damage with just the ring for haste.   I already have a parse here -- <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080421092632/http://wowwebstats.com/zevjvadgdzdj1?s=5376-5551&amp;a=20#summary" target="_blank">Siawyn - WWS</a> -- where I did 1355 DPS without CoS, since there was only one warlock in the raid.  (I've also done 1498 with a non-maledicted CoS) Trying to model ISB uptime is tricky, as there was only one warlock -- affliction to boot -- but only the 2 of us consuming charges.  I don't have any pushback protection, and that's something I'll have to remind myself to ask a resto shaman about.<br>
<br>
However, I come back to what's been addressed in other posts, the duration of the fight is extremely relevant to your DPS.  I use 2 "clicky" trinkets, the Skull and the Hex Shrunken Head.  So the time line for this is the following:<br>
<br>
0:00-0:20 -- Head activated<br>
0:20-0:40 -- Skull activated<br>
2:00-2:20 -- Head activated<br>
2:20-2:40 -- Skull activated (lust is usually on at this point)<br>
<br>
The closer Teron dies to the 2:40 mark, the more that my DPS should increase, certainly more than a kill at say, the 3:15 mark.   This isn't even considering bloodlust/heroism being a larger percentage of the fight.  So it's hard to judge improvement from week to week when the kills keep coming faster.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_614035"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->There needs to be a lot more data, ie many many wws parses with as similar conditions as possible, if you want to prove a gear set via ingame data. Linking just 2 parses and giving that as justification is pretty poor. I could link 2 WWS prases, one with my Rage dps at 1231 the other at 1250 and say that the 1250 was because I had techno music on and techno music makes me play better.

</div>Is there a reason you don't use your skull + head at the same time?  I just macro them both and then I have a higher dps gain then using them separately.<br>
<br>
Regardless, this brings back the issue that other "hybrid" (dps/something else) classes don't top out nearly as low as we do :P.  If everything breaks correctly, yeah, we can hit 1600 dps...okay...so Kyou averaging 1700dps as an ele shaman when things don't break right...The highest I've hit when everything broke right was like 1563 or something - so yeah, "breaking right."

</div>Here's a parse from a couple weeks ago with my old guild, we had the unusual setup of a malediction affliction lock and 3 other destro locks, with me as the only shadowpriest.  I did 1534 DPS: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080421092632/http://wowwebstats.com/vou6ewvxezbf3?s=7427-7627" target="_blank">Wow Web Stats</a><br>
<br>
My best with 2 shadowpriests in the raid with 2-3 locks was 1430 DPS, so take from that what you will.<br>
<br>
One way you could start to measure ISB uptime would be to look at your average dot ticks, my average dot ticks on the above parse are about 100 more than what they are in a 2 Shadowpriest/2 Warlock makeup.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Apparently I'm an idiot.. I read in the patch notes in the previous patch that "-  Hex Shrunken Head: This item now has a 20 second shared cooldown with other similar trinkets."  and assumed that you could no longer have both active.  What happens is if I use the Head first, the Skull now has a 20 seconds cooldown on it, but if I use the Skull first I still can use the Head.  I guess previously I had macroed it to use the Head first, and then the Skull and it was working okay until the patch.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_614838"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->It was a typo, and I apologize.  However, the point still stands that individuals need to collect data in a vacuum, and comparing player by player is largely useless to measure the optimal effects of haste.  My stance is that parsing boom after boom would be the only way to get a much more effective grasp on the effects of haste (using both gearsets, and running an unholy number of dps cycles).<br>
<br>
Edit:  To reiterate how comparing players with completely different gear sets, raid comp, and different people with potentially different cycles is terrible:  Intricacy (according to that wws) was not using an MSD, whereas Keiea had a few procs.  Also, the dps deficit created by the difference between icon and hex shrunken head is approx 20 +damage (~10dps) including the proc.  Intric also had two drums of battle and bloodlust, yet managed to get less mindflays per minute, which also doesnt make sense.  I had Intric at 18.76 flays/min whereas Keiea had 27.75 flays/min.  Thus, with passive 135 haste (and less+dmg) doing that much more dps (and flays/min) with the Intric having lust and DOB, simply doesn't make sense at all to me.<br>
<br>
Edit2:  Also, yes Tedv, you can easily do a full burn cycle without imp VE.  I have a few recordings of "perfect" cycles I could post.  You just go until you go oom.  As long as boom doesnt resist 2-3 VE in a row, you should have no problems whatsoever going all out, even with numerous death crits in a row.  Especially since there are no raid debuffs, your deaths wont be critting for over 3k (generally) and with endgame gear, one probably has about 9.5k hp unbuffed, and 1 death every 12 seconds, and healing coming in between each shouldn't be an issue.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_618355"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The past two weeks I sat for people that needed gear, but I got a decent WWS tonight.  With one warlock and three shadow priests I was able to put out 1413 DPS over 4m45s.  I was using major shadow power and draenic wisdom pots with a mix of damage and haste gear for 2.75s mind flays.  I'm currently logged out in the gear I used. My crit rate was below average, but I was able to trinket three times, which goes even further to show how optimum fight durations can skew the final DPS number.<br>

		<div id="post_message_620137"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hi, I'm trying to guide one of my guildmates into better play.  He plays a shadow priest, and while I've never played the class, I read through and gave him some advice.  I do have some questions, though.<br>
<br>
First off, how much mana should he be returning?  Given his current WWS, it looks like he's returning about 4.3% (on fights like tidewalker where he gets to just spam the boss, not fights where he has to deal with adds.)<br>
<br>
Second off, how should VE work into the priority system outlined in the OP?  For fights where there's not a lot of raid damage/chance of raid death, I told him to just fit it in where he could.  But for fights with high raid damage, I'm not sure where to put it in.  Currently we're working on Vashj.<br>
<br>
Edit:  Oh, I forgot.  I also plan to teach him the wonders of chaincasting spells, instead of waiting .3 seconds between each spell.  I'm going to recommend he spam buttons in conjunction with quartz, but that doesn't work with mind flay.  From my understanding there's a simple macro floating around somewhere that checks if he is channeling mind flay, and casts the spell if he isn't?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The real question is "What percent of the fight is Vampiric Touch up for?"  He should have 80% at a bare minimum, and 90% is a typical average for good priests.  If it's just up for 60% or less, he's not doing his job.<br>
<br>
Also, I'm not sure what you mean about "fights where he has to deal with adds".  In SSC and Tempest Keep I guess there's Vashj, Kael'thas, Solarian, and Lurker where you don't have a choice.  Karathres technically has adds, but you DPS them while they are fully debuffed so the damage shouldn't change, and for everything else you can spend nearly the entire time on the boss.<br>

</div>If there is low raid damage, don't bother casting it until you would otherwise cast mind flay but have 1.5 seconds until can cast another spell (eg. Mind Blast or Vampiric Touch).  Then refresh Embrace as a time filler.<br>
<br>
If there is moderate raid damage, keep it up from the start and refresh either when there's a filler moment or right after it drops off.  As long as it doesn't cause you to pull aggro, you want it up.<br>
<br>
If there is heavy raid damage AND Vampiric Embrace would make you pull aggro (eg. Morogrim or Gurtogg), then the biggest raid benefit is for your shaman to change from Wrath of Air to Tranquil Air.  Usually this in conjunction with Salvation is enough threat reduction that it won't pull aggro.  (On fights like Morogrim this is particularly helpful because it keeps the mages who AoE safe from the murlocs as well.)<br>
<br>
If there is heavy damage and Embrace would still pull aggro even when Tranquil Air is down, then you either drop Vampiric Embrace or you keep it up and use a lower damage cycle.  If you have a lot of mana, you can switching out of shadow form every once and a while for Prayer of Mending and Binding Heal.  I do a mix of the two on Gurtogg, for example.  The correct choice really depends on how much help the healers need, and whether they need mana more or additional healers.  So that depends on your raid makeup for the fight.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The % mana return is exactly equivalent to that question, really.  4.3% is equivalent to 86% uptime (4.3/5).  The quick calculation for damage uptime is:<br>

100*(mana in from VT) / (shadow damage out * 0.05)<br>

E.G., on the last Gorefiend, I dealt 264718 shadow damage and regenned 13,021 mana via VT.  That's 98% uptime during damage.  Obviously, the goal should be 100% damage uptime.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Is this really the best cycle for activating trinkets?<br>
<br>
I generally don't use my first damage trinket cooldown until the second cycle of Vampiric Touch. Just so the damage buff gets the full benefit of Shadow weaving. I also generally try to time the trinket buffs with a 20 second duration to get two cycles of Vampiric Touch cast within it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Well he also had 40 extra ticks of both Shadow Word: Pain and Vampiric Touch.  He cast twice as many Devouring Plagues.  And he cast an extra 25 seconds of Mind Flay.  Basically you are spending time not casting spells while he is still casting.  Stop not casting spells!  Or put another way, is your latency high?  Do you have a DoT timer?  How much time elapses between each spell cast?  Do you find yourself repositioning a lot during fight?  That should give you hints on how to improve your damage.<br>
<br>
By the way, you should probably spell check and correct you post if you want to avoid an infraction.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I apologize, this is indeed what I meant, he has about 86% uptime.  So we need to increase that to 98%-100%?  I assume he's not chaincasting his spells, so that alone is going to be a major boost to his DPS if he can do it <br>
<br>
Also, devouring plague...  I believe that's the undead racial?  And he is an undead shadow priest, so should it be in his priority system?  If so, where in the priority system?<br>
<br>
Finally, is there a macro that casts mind blast, then SWD if that is on cooldown, then mind flay if both of those are on cooldown?  If they were all instants a few /cast and /stop cast would do it...<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Differences like that in DPS time on Illidan is most likely down to how you handle the demon form in P3 forward. Usually you can keep dots up on Illidan throughout that entire phase if you are smart with refreshes and movement.<br>
<br>
Refresh dots on Illidan before the transition to demon<br>
Move to a safe spot for the first explosion<br>
After explosion First Aid, refresh VT and run back before demon spawn<br>
Once demons spawn dps them until they are obviously controlled, then refresh dots on Illidan<br>
You might even throw in a few MBs on Illidan if you feel safe with regards to threat<br>
<br>
Note that this probably isn't beneficial to the raid as a whole due to slightly increased risk, but it does allow you to keep the 96% dps time of your #1 priest. I wouldn't do it before Illidan is truly on farm since it's not really a dps encounter, but at the point you are, you can start having fun and trying to win. <br>
<br>
Demon phase dots and dual dotting Flames are the reasons shadow priests are able to top damage meters on Illidan. Use it for what it's worth.<br>
<br>
Aside from that, your MB hit number is way too low. A 15 minute Illidan kill should let you do 40+ Mind Blasts.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Would it be a safe assumption to say that spell haste is now twice as good as it was before, since roughly half our time was spent casting spells that weren't mind flay?  At any rate, this should settle the "is haste worth it?" argument once and for all.  It also makes <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32483" target="_blank">[The Skull of Gul'dan]</a> definitively better than <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=33829" target="_blank">[Hex Shrunken Head]</a>.<br>

</div>I'm not so sure about that... Currently you need 197 to fit 2 hasted flays in the 5.5mb cooldown, but that's because the GCD causes you to have dead time between the time your first MB cast ends and your first MF cast begins.  If the changes to haste in 2.4 result in you actually being able to start your MF at the end of your MB cast, you'd only need 143.  To clarify: I'm not suggesting that you wouldn't want to stack large amounts of haste, just that I don't think 197 will be a magical number anymore.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_622391"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The big difference now is that untill someone gets to 33% haste all our spells scale exactly the same with haste as MF use to meaning haste is our best stat like it is for pretty much every other caster.  What's going to be important now is maximizing our highest dps spells usage which will always be non MF spells.

This setup is the best way to give you the 197 haste you need to avoid GCD clipping. Who knows, though - maybe haste is now worth it all the way up to 250 or 300 or something. In any case, getting to 197 haste is now absolutely worth it and these seven items should be on the top of any Shadow Priest's wishlist.</div>

Once we get a haste pt -&gt; dmg conversion that makes sense it'll be a lot easier to figure this all out.  Arguably, if possible - you'd even go below the  1 gcd since it still scales mindflay significantly...at least, that's my initial thought on it (as long as the pieces are quality pieces).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I'm not so sure about that... Currently you need 197 to fit 2 hasted flays in the 5.5mb cooldown, but that's because the GCD causes you to have dead time between the time your first MB cast ends and your first MF cast begins.  If the changes to haste in 2.4 result in you actually being able to start your MF at the end of your MB cast, you'd only need 143.  To clarify: I'm not suggesting that you wouldn't want to stack large amounts of haste, just that I don't think 197 will be a magical number anymore.</div>

I counted 6 crit rating as 1 haste and ignored hit rating, by the way.  And every slot gets a spinel.<br>

</div>No, they won't.<br>
<br>
33% haste would knock a 1.5 second cast MB down to 1 second, true. But that means you can cast MB once every 6.5 seconds rather than once every 7 seconds. 1-6.5/7 = about a 7% DPS increase on MB over the course of a fight. <br>
<br>
It has 0 effect on Shadow Word Pain, just letting the following spell be cast a bit sooner.<br>
<br>
It only effects the second VT you cast, all others are just chained to the previous giving you 0.5 seconds more VT time regardless of the fight length.<br>
<br>
It has 0 effect on how often you can cast Shadow Word: Death though it lets you cast the spell after SW: Death faster.<br>
<br>
The effect on Mind Flay has not changed.<br>
<br>
We won't begin to scale linearly with haste the way locks do, or nearly linearly the way mages do. The biggest determinant of our DPS is how often we can cast our spells not how long it takes to cast our spells like most other casters.<br>
<br>
I'm skeptical that this will be a significant enough change to make haste stacking significantly better for us than it is now.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>With troll berserking, bloodlust, skull, and haste gear I can hit around 1.2-1.4s MFs.  With a focus gem proc my MF is 1.33s normally, or under 1s with various combinations of the aforementioned buffs.  So under certain circumstances my MF can drop below 1.5s.  If that's with the super buff scenario then I can do it for 10 seconds consecutively and actually put out more DPS with MF than MB.

</div>Not true.  It gives you 0.5 seconds more *casting* time between VTs, which is a significant benefit.  Same is true for MB and Death; you get slightly more cast time potentially spent on filling with flay, as well as a flay DPS boost.<br>
<br>
Think of it this way, with a 1s GCD and 50% haste to get you there, an initial sequence looks something like.<br>
<br>
-1.0 VT starts casting<br>
0.0 VT casts, GCD Ends<br>
0.0 SWP casts<br>
1.0 GCD ends<br>
1.0 MB starts casting<br>
2.0 MB casts, GCD ends<br>
2.0 SWD casts<br>
3.0 GCD ends<br>
3.0 MF casts<br>
4.0 GCD ends<br>
5.0 MF finishes casting<br>
5.0 MF casts<br>
6.0 GCD ends<br>
7.0 MF end<br>
7.0-7.5 ?deadtime? in reality, probably lag eliminates this<br>
7.5 MB cooldown ends<br>
7.5 MB starts casting<br>
8.5 MB casts, GCD ends<br>
8.5 MF casts<br>
9.5 GCD ends<br>
10.5 MF ends<br>
10.5 MF casts<br>
11.5 GCD ends<br>
12.5 MF ends<br>
12.5 MF casts<br>
13.5 GCD ends<br>
14.0 SWD cooldown ends, MB cooldown ends<br>
14.0 VT casts, clipping MF after 2 ticks<br>
<br>
That's 2 mindblasts, 1 SWD, 4.66 MFs, and SWP/VT uptime.  Compared to the 1.5s GCD, where you wouldn't even get 4 full MFs in that sequence, it's a significant benefit.  I'll work on the sim at some point soon to reflect this change; I expect it to show haste getting a significant increase, especially once I implement MF clipping.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_622874"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Here's some napkin math to try and find how much dps one point of haste rating is. I'm not sure if it's correct and it ignores spell rotation timings like the ones discussed in the previous posts, so it'll probably only be right for specific amounts of haste that makes them line up.<br>
<br>
In a one minute fight 1% spellhaste would give another 60 - (60 / 1,01) = 0,59 seconds to cast spells in, maybe a bit less since you don't really spend all 60 seconds casting due to latency and reaction time. (And assuming you stay below the 1 second GCD cap which seems impossible to reach).<br>
<br>
So that's another 0,59 * your dps damage over 60 seconds for 15,7 rating. If we assume a base dps of around 400 with 0 spellpower and 1 spellpower = +0,5 dps (which seems reasonable from my Dr. Boom testing) we get this for 1200 spellpower:<br>
<br>
((60 - (60 / 1,01)) * (400 + (1 200 / 2))) / 60 = 9,9 extra dps for 15,7 rating, meaning 1 spell haste rating = +0,63 dps or 1 spell haste rating = 1,26 spellpower.<br>
<br>
Is this on the right track or am I too tired to theorycraft properly?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_623452"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Napkin math attempt:<br>
<br>
A shadow priest might spend half a fight casting MF, so over a 300s fight you might spend 150s casting MF, and 150s casting everything else.<br>
<br>
Haste has two effects:<ol style="list-style-type: decimal"><li>It lets you spend less time casting everything else.</li>
<li>It lets you pack more MFs in per minute.</li>
</ol><br>
393 spell haste should be enough for 25% haste, so your "everything else" period goes from 150s to (150/(1 + 25%)) = 120s, giving you an extra 30s of MF time.  Further, in the 180s of MF time you can pack in (180*(1+25%)) =  225s worth of unhasted MF.<br>
<br>
So, in a 300s fight with 25% haste you gain 225 - 150 = 75s worth of unhasted MF spam, which is 25% of the fight time.  More generally, you always will gain X% of total fight length in MF spam, where X is your haste %.<br>
<br>
If your MF does 500 dps, then for 25% haste and a 300s fight you gain an extra 25%*300*500 = 37.5k damage, which works out to an extra 125 dps over the fight.  More generally, if you have X% haste and a Y dps unhasted MF, you should see an increase of X*Y dps for the entire fight.<br>
<br>
Caveats:  Haste may mess up your spell rotations and add dead time, or improve them and remove it.  Probably more the former than the latter, but for a long run average, X% haste giving you extra dps equal to X% of your unhasted MF dps seems a good approximation...if my napkin math is even vaguely correct.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_623814"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I've been thinking about it and I really don't think it will be anymore benificial to go past 2.75 second MF's asside from making up for latency.  To the best of my knowledge we get our maximum dps while using a 5/5 Imp MB every cooldown.  That means with the new haste rating the cycle is going to be 6.875 seconds long meaning 13.75 seconds for every two cycles.  So if you are employing a MB, MF, MF, MB, MF, VT, SWD cycle you are delaying your SWD by only 1.75 seconds and are cutting off your last tick of VT 1.75 seconds in.  Adding any more haste will effectively make your SWD and MB downtime greater which one could argue would be balanced by more MF time however adding more SP will no questions asked increase your dps.  The only other way I can think of to come up with another rotation that fits in with this one requires you to do:<br>
<br>
MB, MF(2 ticks), MF(2 ticks), MF (Full), MB, MF(2 ticks), MF(2 ticks), VT, SWD<br>
<br>
Where you use two ticks so you can get around the problem of trying to get in 1 extra tick and the global cooldown still being up.  However this would require at least 27.23% haste or 430 haste rating to do. Which I believe may be possible but would require every piece of haste gear currently in the game.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_624938"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The spellhaste announced change is very interesting.<br>
<br>
I went through doing some frequency charts assuming perfect cooldowns and casting (lag creates too much varitation)<br>
I'd like to share some of the values I got for the per-point values<br>
<br>
<br>
Using ~1300+ shadow<br>
Stat type =&gt; flayspam dps - cooldown dps<br>
<br>
+1 damage =&gt; 0.21 - 0.40<br>
+1 crit rating =&gt; 0.00 - 0.11<br>
+1 hit rating =&gt; 0.37 - 0.81  (zero when capped)<br>
+1 haste rating =&gt; 0.08 - 0.25<br>
<br>
<br>
While still not as superior as spell damage, Blizzard's itemization formula favors the splitting between two stats.  Thus spell haste fills that position.  The most surprising part is that my data suggests that spell haste only GAINS dps for the least amount of mindflaying and LOSES dps when you exclusively cast mindflay.<br>
<br>
Do these figures look reasonable?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">The spellhaste announced change is very interesting.<br>
<br>
I went through doing some frequency charts assuming perfect cooldowns and casting (lag creates too much varitation)<br>
I'd like to share some of the values I got for the per-point values<br>
<br>
<br>
Using ~1300+ shadow<br>
Stat type =&gt; flayspam dps - cooldown dps<br>
<br>
+1 damage =&gt; 0.21 - 0.40<br>
+1 crit rating =&gt; 0.00 - 0.11<br>
+1 hit rating =&gt; 0.37 - 0.81  (zero when capped)<br>
+1 haste rating =&gt; 0.08 - 0.25<br>
<br>
<br>
While still not as superior as spell damage, Blizzard's itemization formula favors the splitting between two stats.  Thus spell haste fills that position.  The most surprising part is that my data suggests that spell haste only GAINS dps for the least amount of mindflaying and LOSES dps when you exclusively cast mindflay.<br>
<br>
Do these figures look reasonable?</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>How exactly did you come up with these numbers?  In particular, how was hit rating modeled?  Getting a resist on your mind flay seriously messes up cycles because it only costs 1.5 seconds when you were planning on spending 3 seconds casting it, so accounting for that effect is not trivial.<br>
<br>
Just eyeballing the numbers, the basic ratio of crit to damage is around 6:1 which is what your estimate says as well.  For haste BEFORE the GCD change, there were three different estimates:<br>
<br>
- Me: 1 haste = .5 to .6 damage<br>
- Nikitabanana: 1 haste = 1 damage or better<br>
- Simulation: 1 haste = .8 to 1.0 damage (sorry, forgot who ran this)<br>
<br>
Your numbers estimate .54 damage, which matches up with the lowest estimate (mine) before this change was announced.  The ballpark estimate is that haste is now twice as good as before, so your haste estimate seems off by an order of magnitude.<br>
<br>
Another thing to keep in mind is that trading 1 haste rating for X damage is not the same as trading 100 haste rating for 100*X damage, because of how haste can help or hinder cycles.  The second trade might be better or it might be worse-- we really don't know.  So I'm curious how the haste number was computed as well.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_625101"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'll be quite honest: I believe many of these posts are overvaluing haste by a large margin.  My theory numbers showed haste was horrible all the way to patch 2.3, but I'm now picking up pieces to run some real live tests (at 144 rating)<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The model takes for granted that spells must be casted in units and operates the assumption that you can find the perfect cycle/priority to keep all spells on cooldown.  It's easier this way since it provides a hard limit.<br>
<br>
Works like this:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:0px"><img src="assets/code_html.gif" border="0"></div>
	<pre class="alt2" dir="ltr" style="
		margin: 0px;
		padding: 3px;
		border: 1px inset;
		width: 694px;
		height: 66px;
		text-align: left;
		overflow: auto">haste_rating/( 10 *(70+12)/53) = haste_multiplier
casttime = base_casttime/(1+haste_multiplier)
spell_frequency_casttime = 1/(spell_cooldown)*casttime</pre>
</div>  <i>*Note* spell_cooldown is the duration of the dot or hard cooldown, and mindblast has an extra +casttime</i><br>
You sum up all frequencies except for mindflay, which then fills the frequency sum to reach 1.<br>
Numbers for mindflay range from 0.51 up to 0.83 (which is a simple VT-pain-flay cycle)<br>
<br>
From this point, we know the time spent casting each spell, so we simply calculate casting dps<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:0px"><img src="assets/code_html.gif" border="0"></div>
	<pre class="alt2" dir="ltr" style="
		margin: 0px;
		padding: 3px;
		border: 1px inset;
		width: 694px;
		height: 34px;
		text-align: left;
		overflow: auto">dpct = (base_damage + spell_bonus*coof)*(1*(1-critrate)+1.5*(critrate))*hitrate*collective_multipliers*(1-natural_boss_mirigration) / casttime</pre>
</div>The multipliers I used were shadow form, darkness, weaving, misery, CoS (not improved), and 40% uptime on Imp SB, which is 1.73.  Hit rating is taken for granted as a flat modifier as the mindflay resist rate(the only thing gains time) in the overall scheme of things is 0.5%, which gives an improvement of less than 2dps.  I considered it too trivial for the work required to calculate.  And remember, I'm running the formulas based on FREQUENCIES, not cycles.  These numbers should represent the ideal cycle.  It's the casters responsibility to improvise.<br>
<br>
After you have the frequencies and damage per casttime, just multiply.<br>
<br>
<br>
Perhaps you would want to play around with the excel sheet?  (I would need some hosting service though, if you know of any)  Your other simulation numbers probably have set up a more ideal raiding setup.  I am more concerned with the comparison ratios between each stat, so I set up a more typical run of the mill raid.  The whole purpose of the exercise was to find the better equipment, not necessarily make absolutes (every other fight seems to change dps output anyways).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I accounted for crit rating.  If you include the extra 3 spell damage from Divine Spirit (which many raids farming Illidan no longer have), it's still a trade of 45 spell damage for 45 haste, and if even the low estimates are correct, 1 haste &gt; 1 damage.  So it seems like the badge legs win out regardless, unless you really need the hit rating from channeled elements for some reason.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Note that with the "perfect gear setup" given new changes, you'll be either hit starved or just barely have enough, depending on some close calls like Badge legs vs LoCE. That is assuming you want no more than 3/5 Shadow Focus to fit in 5/5 Imp MB without dropping anything else. Spell hit actually has some value in the high end now, since the spell haste gear almost universally lacks it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
I will note, it handles some things vaguely incorrectly for ease of coding.  DoTs are treated as nukes with long cooldowns, for example, and resists are coded in as a damage loss, so you don't get the MF resist benefit.  Procs are not handled at all, nor do I intend for them to be, nor is bloodlust dealt with (you could easily handle bloodlust cycles by changing the haste value you feed it.)  There are internal flags for 2/4T6 and patch 2.4; by default, all three are currently enabled.<br>
<br>
Some interesting results I've gotten so far:<br>
<br>
- Haste is ~1:1 with damage, but not as linear - damage is a linear gain, while haste's value changes over time.<br>
- Waiting for cooldowns/dot expiration has a very small effect on your DPS, and depending on the priority you use, may have no effect.<br>
- There are specific values of haste which have a negative effect on the queueing logic I'm using, such that you lose DPS by increasing haste.  I have no idea why.  The 'waiting' logic I added mitigates this, assuming the right wait time.  The right wait time is variable.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>They're points where the mindblast cooldown lowers such that the simulator (which does not clip flays) selects to flay instead of waiting for a mindblast.  The simulator settings that provided the graphic used a 0 wait queue.  It also did not incorporate the 2.4 GCD lowering.  As such, I don't find either the dips or the independence of haste's benefit vs. +dmg to be surprising.  After all, haste is essentially only a significant benefit on MF right now, with a minor MB benefit - as such, the nonlinear varying with +dmg shouldn't be visible on a graph at that scale.  The simulation is provided; feel free to run it with your own settings.<br>
<br>
Also, if you use queues with waiting, those dips are no longer there.<br>

We aren't destro locks or mages.  Our DoTs, which are essentially unaffected by haste, compose a significant portion of our DPS and gain linearly from +dmg.  Our nukes are also almost unaffected by haste.  Once you've established these components as nearly independent of haste, the only source of potential nonlinearity is seen in MF.  MF is ~25-30% of our DPS.  The nonlinearity you're trying to see in a low resolution graph is going to be invisible.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Haste would be perfect if it were taking place in continuous time. However, in wow, the decisions and gameplay are made in a discrete time setting. <br>
As you know, in a DPS cycle, there are some shifty moments where you have 0.5 seconds for example before MB and you are faced with the decision to either cast a full mindflay, clip MF after 1 tick, clip MF after 2 ticks or just wait 0.5 seconds and cast MB. <br>
When you have some haste, these gap are reduced, but they are not the same during the cycle. The first might be 0.4, some next might be 0.2 and so on. <br>
Let's look at the case of 0.2 seconds. As you add more haste, this gap will go to 0 at some point. All good so far. As you add a little more haste, however, a spell will shift  in the cycle prior to mindblast (as if the gap has become -0.1 seconds), leaving you with a new gap, of perhaps 0.9 seconds. <br>
So even though you added that last amount of haste, here you will be forced to take again a low dps route, for at least a GCD amount of time, lowering your dps significantly. This should be more self-explanatory in a simulation where you can see the actual cycles for various levels of haste, compare the dps, and set various decision making rules regarding what to do in case of a  cooldown gap.<br>
<br>
Haste being linear with respect to spell dmg is a bit odd though, that's true.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_630080"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The thing that's always bothered me about gearing for haste rating is simply the artificial limitation VT puts on the situation.  If you assume you're casting VT every 15 seconds (for ideal uptime), then the benifit from haste is lessened from an "over the fight" style benifit to "within the 'rotation'" benifit.  (I only use the word rotation simply because it's a convenient word, not because I believe there is a rotation involved at all.)<br>
<br>
Assuming for a minute that you have 3% haste, you would expect to see 3% more mindflay DPS assuming you filled all the 'extra' time given with flays.  However, within the 15 second window the benifit from haste is so minimal that you wouldn't be able to even see another tick of flays, thus preventing you from actually seeing a DPS benifit.<br>
<br>
00:00 VT<br>
01:30 MB<br>
03:00 Flay<br>
06:00 Flay<br>
09:00 MB<br>
10:30 SW: D<br>
12:00 Flay<br>
15:00 VT<br>
<br>
With the above, ideal setup (SW:P before the VT, SW: D and MB off CD), you cannot move the VT.  Within the 15 seconds, in order to get an extra second (and thus an extra flay tick), you would need to shave off 1/3rd of a second from a flay (post 2.4, 1/4th a second off flay and 1/12th a second off MB/SW: D).  To me, this seems like benifit from haste would follow more of a step progression than a linear (or semi-linear) progression of benifit.  I.E., no benifit up until X value, then no more benifit until 2X value.<br>
<br>
I know that it seems like a very simplistic way of looking at things, but with the 15 second limitation imposed by VT, small benifits fail to add up over time simply because they don't provide more casts without scads of it(which is where the real benifit of haste comes from).  All of the above assumes no lag, of course, and I'm looking to pick up a few of the better haste pieces simply to overcome my 120 or so ping times, but since lag issues would occur at each 'step', it seems that it's more of a shift than a real counter to the above.  I just fail to see how improving the DPS of individual mindflay casts helps your overall DPS if you're not actually dealing more damage over the course of a boss fight.  <br>
<br>
Is there anything that I'm directly missing by the above?  Something that I haven't looked at in depth is people becoming more lax with VT for the sake of more DPS, but I'm convinced that my role in the raid is never sacrificing group mana regen for the sake of higher DPS, which may be a misconception on my part.  I've seen a lot of math that breaks down spell usage and judges the benifit from haste that way, but would love to see an ideal representation that shows an increase in DPS due to a smallish amount of haste (say...4% haste, compared to the exact same gear pre-haste) in a mapped out way.  I will start to work on it myself, but my handiwork with excel/calc isn't too hot.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>What Deenogger tries to tell I think, is that you should re-evaluate what you're doing with your gear right now. Some enchant choices are really bad (like the bracers..) and some items can easily be swapped in for better alternatives (seriously reconsider that belt for example). <br>
<br>
For your gear, your dps numbers aren't bad. It's the gear that is holding you back and that is easily fixed.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_630440"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Actually, I'm ah...fairly surprised you managed to hit 780 dps with that gear.  You've got several blues, a couple very poor items, and some fairly questionable gems and enchants.

<br>
And as for your glove enchant...umm...<br>
<br>
Your spec is also a little unusual; given your gear, I find it surprising that you wouldn't have mana issues doing a full burn rotation; this makes your choice of 1/5 Blackout, 5/5 Imp MB, 5/5 Shadow Weaving, but 0/3 Meditation a bit odd.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
As for haste and VT, seems like a very viable point IF VT is actually that important that you can't lose any of it, as if you could you'd get to the point where you're supposed to VT but don't want to clip it and thus use a different spell first and then VT - which may or may not be a dps loss and will affect the benefit of haste (if any). While "forcing" VT every 15 seconds regardless is probably the right thing, I wouldn't jump to assume it without going over the numbers first and checking if delaying VT by a little is worth some flay gain (or better, earlier MB/SWD if they just came up).

</div>Well you can also cast VT every 16 or even 16.5 seconds if it works better that way.  Generally the worst that happens is you miss a Pain tick, and even that doesn't happen always (since pain ticks once every three seconds).<br>
<br>
On a related note, I've started clipping a few mind flays at 2 seconds if a high priority cooldown (touch or blast) is up.  It's actually not as hard to do well as you'd think.  I just watch the quartz timer until the seconds remaining reads 0.X and then cast immediately.  Between lag and reasonable reflexes, I don't think I've missed the second tick yet, although I have hit it as late as 2.4 seconds.  However, it seems like starting the mind blast cooldown a full second earlier is a huge win.<br>
<br>
The other thing I've noticed while micromanaging my cycle is how often you have roughly between .5 and 1.5 seconds left on Mind Blast and nothing to do but Mind Flay.  That simulator graph showed me how bad it was to cast a full mind flay when you only have .5 seconds left until blast, so I've started just adding deadtime in there, since it seems to be a net win.  With 1.5 seconds, I often cast Mind Flay for 2 seconds and then Mind Blast.  I'm not sure how this is affecting my damage, but it's definitely not dropping.  It's probably just a minor improvement.<br>
<br>
At any rate, I could easily see how another 100 points of haste would smooth out the cycle instead of adding more.  Or maybe it will break even, smoothing out some issues but removing others.  I'm not convinced that it's incorrect to use a flat, linear estimate for the value of a point of haste.  Or at least for every 25 points of haste.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>My guild is at the point right now where I'm starting to get outpaced by other DPS classes that have been gearing up (rogues/hunters/destro lock/arcane mage in particular), and I don't entirely mind it because as soon as we kill Kael, that gap is going to increase even more.  I guess it all just comes down to a philosophy decision if you want to delay VT a bit to eke out a bit more DPS or if you want to get as close to a 5% return on damage as you can.  I know I'm not going to be competitive with the rogues, and I'm not providing the second best reason to bring a spriest to raids by ignoring VT.<br>
<br>
Then again, if the extent of the haste changes are drastic enough to get anywhere close, I'd love to abandon the above to get into e-peen fights with the rogues again.  I just don't forsee that happening anytime soon, so I'll prolly sit down and work out the step function and pick up enough to jump up a 'tier' or two of extra DPS.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Chaindrink Super Manapots, use Mageblood Potion, try 3/3 Meditation, 0/5 Blackout, 4/5 Imp MB, 4/5 Shadowweaving.<br>
Stack Shadowdmg as far as possible in raid (Pot, Food, Oil). You can also ask a pally to put and hold JoW on bossmobs.<br>

I'm used to 10% spellhit on gear (wanna have Inner Focus, 3/3 Medi and 5/5 MB), and tried to stack shadowdmg and<br>
spellhaste. I'm not sure about spelldmg&lt;-&gt;spellhaste-coeff. so i'va chosen za boots instead of fsw-boots.<br>
Does anybody see improvements or have other suggestions on gear for starting into 2.4?<br>

</div>Until I see more evidence I've just been ballparking spell haste to damage at a 1:1 ratio, so that would be the equivalent of a Runed Living Ruby.  Basically it opens up options for getting socket bonuses -- and it remains to be seen what the new meta gem will take.   You won't be able to use these gems if you're still using a MSD for example.  It does make <a class="q3" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28557" target="_blank">[Swift Starfire Diamond]</a> a much easier meta to use though.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The most generous estimates are that 1 haste = 1 or 1.1 spelldamage, so if you believe the latter the haste/damage gem would be 0.4 better than a living ruby. Personally, I'd say it would take some research and would only replace Living Rubies if the added haste got you to a point of inflection for DPS. Something like getting enough haste to fit 2 MF's between two 5/5 imp MBs. *edit* It's been so long that I've been looking at plain red that I didn't even think of the value of using them for socket bonuses. &gt;.&gt; */edit*<br>
<br>
I think theorycrafting is seriously overvaluing the effect of a hasted GCD in practice. There a two methodological flaws I see in the models so far and the conclusions we draw from them.<br>
<br>
First and perhapse minor is that most of the calculations for the value of haste I've seen are using higher spelldamage than is available with any significant amounts of haste. For example, the "Best ear Available" thread in shadowpriest.com values haste as calculated at 1400 spelldamage when ranking gear. I doubt even a majority of posters here will be able to have that level of spelldamage when converting to haste gear, let alone someone only in T5 content where they are trading significant spelldamage for haste.<br>
<br>
Secondly, and more importantly, the damage gains are modeled as gains from increased Mind Flay damage and they're continuous functions. That is, they assume you will gain 5% more damage from Mind Flay if your haste rating allows you to cast Mind Flay 5% longer. Instead our damage is a discrete function where Mind Flay does 1/3 of its damage every 1/3 of its casting time. In practice this means you'll gain a tick of mind flay here and two ticks there. Lowering the global cooldown 10% doesn't mean you'll have an extra 6 seconds with nothing to do but flay after 54 seconds, those six seconds are mixed in between 15 and 24/27 second dot durations and 5.5 and 12 second nuke cooldowns and the gains are not guranteed to show up neatly in third increments of your Mind Flay casting time.<br>
<br>
Finally, though not a systemic problem with the theories, the problem in practice is that you're assumed to have infinite, or at least sub tenth of a second precision with your casting. If your Mind Flay lasts 2.75 seconds, it's assumed that you will be able to interrupt it exactly 1.83 seconds to cast a 1.4 second Mind Blast. If you end up interrupting it at 1.9 seconds you just lost all the benefit from that hasted Mind Blast, and if you interrupt it at 1.80 seconds you just lost all the value of 4 1.4 second global cooldowns, roughlt 1/7th of the benefit you would get in one minute of casting. And that doesn't even begin to account for overlapping cooldowns.<br>
<br>
That last point is the main reason I'm not particularly excited about these changes. In order to get the full value of haste we have to be exceptionally precise in our casting. Go over some WWSs and just look at your dot uptime. It's a pretty simple task to reapply a dot exactly when the previous dot dropped but you're doing very well if you can keep your uptime over 90% on any fight where you do more than just stand and cast for a couple minutes. If you're only 90% accurate on something that lasts a quarter or half a minute, how accurate can you be with something that lasts less than a second?<br>
<br>
One more thing since I already have a wall of text up. The value of haste increased a lot <i>compared to what it used to be</i> but that doesn't mean it increased a whole lot <i>in absolute terms</i>. Haste used to be theorycrafted at about 1/2 of a point of spelldamage, it's doubled to being roughly as valuable as spelldamage, but your overall DPS gains aren't going to be tremendous since the final values are still within a hundred or so points of each other at the top end. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080409131726/http://shadowpriest.com/viewtopic.php?t=9745&amp;postdays=0&amp;postorder=asc&amp;start=105" target="_blank">Shadowpriest.com's haste thread</a> has a post 3/4 of the way down that page saying the previous best gear available does 1333 dps on a spreadsheed where the new best gear with 240 more haste does 1370 dps with consumables.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>True, but...  Once you count lag and movement in, cast rotations are already pretty messy, and to max your DPS without any haste will require some split second timing.  I'm not sure I agree that adding a realistic amount of spell haste really makes the problem <i>worse</i>.<br>

</div>My sentiments exactly. I think I'll stick with the "If it's an upgrade without the haste, it's an upgrade with the haste" motto for comparing gear. Counting haste as being equal to x spell damage is oversimplifying things. I think you'll be sorely disappointed if you drop your Nethervoid Cape for Illidan's healing cape and expect your DPS to increase.<br>
<br>
I am excited about the GCD change with regards to Bloodlust, though. Currently I sometimes actually lose DPS with Blooslust up because when I chain a SW: Death or Pain to the end of a spell with a 1.5 second cast it occasionally doesn't go through and that's kind of easy to miss in the middle of a fight. I don't spam my buttons since I used /stopcasting for so long and you can't spam those when there is possible pushback, I just cast and move on and sometimes miss the "This ability is not ready yet" message so I don't catch the missed cast until the next time I check my cooldowns which could be 5 or more seconds later.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>From what I've read, it's around a 10% proc rate.  No word on a hidden CD yet.<br>

Also, when it procs, it apparently shoots a shadow bolt.  So it could very well be possible that Curse of Shadows, Imp. SB, our Shadowform bonus, Misery, etc. would affect the damage of it.  And if that's the case, that would make it an amazing trinket.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

At current itemization levels 1 spell damage = 0.5 dps, with the high amounts of haste on Sunwell gear 1 spell damage will equal slightly over 0.7 dps.<br>
<br>
The average damage dealt by the Timbal's Focusing Crystal proc is 380 assuming it doesn't benefit from CoS or ISB and cant crit or be resisted.<br>
<br>
380/60sec = 6.33 dps per proc/minute<br>
<br>
Without haste:<br>
(44 spell damage)*(.5 dps gain per spell damage) = 22 dps <br>
(22 dps)/(6.33 dps per proc/minute) = 3.47 PPM required to break even with Hex Shrunken head<br>
<br>
With Sunwell amounts of haste:<br>
(44 spell damage)*(.7 dps gain per spell damage) = 30.8 dps <br>
(30.8 dps)/(6.33 dps per proc/minute) = 4.86 PPM required to break even with Hex Shrunken head<br>
<br>
If it does indeed have a 10% proc rate you are looking at a max of 4 ppm with 100% VT and SWP uptime. It should be a very good trinket even if it does not benefit from ISB charges, Misery, Shadow Weaving, or Curse of Shadows.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_634451"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I think people are entirely too locked into the idea that you absolutely must cast VT every 15 seconds.  The reason my simulator isn't producing points of inflection is because it's willing to sacrifice a certain amount of VT time (the exact amount dependent on the wait function) - once you get off the idea you need to be locked exactly to 15 seconds, you'll note that the points of inflection are significantly mitigated, because you *can* get off that extra flay or blast or death.<br>
<br>
People calculating haste:damage solely by trying to estimate MF percentages are certainly not going to come up accurate, but the 0.5:1 number is almost definitely inaccurate - it doesn't match my sims, and it doesn't seem to match people's real world experience either.<br>
<br>
Final point re sims: I'm sitting at 1234 +shadow unbuffed, around 110 haste, without a HSH.  +1400 shadow for haste sims is *not* unreasonable, since I'll be getting 80 from flask, 42 from oil, 23 from food, and a unspecified amount from my second trinket slot (I use Ashtongue or Blessings, depending on the fight).<br>
<br>
As to Timbal's - I'll be shocked if it isn't affected by CoS/Misery/Weaving/ISB.  The real question is whether any of our talents will affect it - odds are it will resist either way.  Either way, it should be a solid trinket; might not beat out HSH, but may well be the second choice and beat out Icon.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>For me it depends on the fight.  For most fights, my group absolutely will not run out of mana simply because I'm there, so occasionally I'll prioritize Mind Blast over Touch.  If they get 320 m/5 instead of 340 m/5, it doesn't matter because they still have enough mana.  Last three fights in Black Temple are a different story though.  For Council, I've started using a few pieces of spell penetration, which seems to help.  On Illidan, I save potion timers for major rejuv, since there is a real concern with running out of either health OR mana on that fight.  After phase 2 though, the mana issues go away with one shadow fiend.<br>
<br>
The only other fight I use rejuvs for is Azgalor if I'm unlucky with Rain of Fire, primarily because I shield myself so much, and that taxes the mana.  Better than dieing though.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_635976"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I am going to have to echo the feeling of others that pushing your own dps by a meaningful amount at the sacrifice of insignificant amounts of mana return is typically ok. Obviously there are situations when your group needs *every* last drop of mana you can give them, and there are also situations when anything above a marginal amount of VT return is more than enough. Most situations certainly fall in the gray area between the two, and it will take a marginal amount of intelligence on the SP to decide when it is safe to allow your VT efficiency to slip to pursue better dps and when it is not. Not unlike knowing when to SW:Death and when not to. <br>
<br>
As far as farming T6, which is hardly as important as the future progression raids of Sunwell, VT return efficiency can seriously dip without any consequence on <i>most</i>, but not all, fights. The exceptions would be Council, Illidan, Kazgalor, and Shahraz. Typical dps slug fests (Terron) certainly do *not* require maximum VT efficiency simply because they are over and done with far too quickly. However, Sunwell encounters could completely turn all this on its head, as a fight can highly dictate how important mana is (duh) just as a fight's specific mechanics can determine weather SW:D is safe or not (at least when learning it).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Plus with the up and coming changes to spirit(with the int % stuff), I doubt we'll really be that needed in the future. Every class has had mana regen buffs now(except for paladins) and this new int/spi factor will increase that even more, so indeed if we do 200 mp5 or 225 mp5, it won't make that much of a difference anyway.</div>

</div>I'm sure our hunters will continue to want a shadow priest. As will Destro Locks &amp; Mages with the advent of tons of haste on all the gear. Healers (mostly other priests and druids) not so much, or at all.<br>
<br>
On the test realm currently we ran the 5 man heroic with a Druid healing and I don't think he dipped below 80% mana once the entire run (Destro lock and mage didn't go oom once either, heck or below 40%.) The benefit of all that mana regen allows the caster to not thing about conservation and focus on their job (dips or heajls) and ultimately that's the point I believe.<br>
<br>
However, I believe your point is losing 10% mana regen is worth the extra dps we provide. Its situational... (what a lame answer Deadjon LOL!)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_636453"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I think it comes down to what you’re going to miss the mana return from.  I agree that letting one SW: P tick slip through isn't that bad but if you hold off casting the VT to sneak a MB in and the VT is down by the time the MB hits it could have a noticeable effect in aggregate.  <br>
<br>
This discussion is getting off point though.  The main idea is how much haste is going to contribute to our DPS.  Shadowpriest.com has a thread up with gear a ranking which is assuming a 1:1 haste to damage ratio.  From the discussion here I think that ratio is far too high.  At most a certain value of haste will allow you to sneak in another GCD in the ~15sec window between VTs.  Therefore there should be a sweetspot at which point stacking more haste does nothing for you since you will never be able to sneak in two global cooldowns.  That's what people are talking about when they speak of points of inflection.  <br>
<br>
The question on the table is what is the magic number for haste?  Then it becomes how to achieve that number with the highest raw damage while remaining hit capped.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>If your goal is gaining another 1.5 / (1 + haste) seconds every 15 seconds then:<br>
<br>
Normal cast time: 15<br>
Hasted cast time: 15 / (1 + haste)<br>
15 - 15 / (1 + haste) = 1.5 / (1 + haste)<br>
<br>
Now just solve for the haste percent:<br>
<br>
15 = 16.5 / (1 + haste)<br>
15 + 15 * haste = 16.5<br>
haste = 1.5 / 15 = 10%<br>
<br>
So you'll need 157 haste rating to get 10% haste.  I'm not convinced of the magic number theory, but if there is one, the first step would be at 157 and the second at 20% haste (314).  I highly doubt the spell damage loss is worth stacking 314 haste though.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I suspect it will work just like shadow damage from wands-- any debuffs on the target will affect the damage but no talents from the caster.  So we're looking 113% * 105% * 110% * 120% = 156.6% of base damage best case.  Or if your guild's Affliction Warlocks are like mine and think Improved Howl is good for raiding and Malediction is bad, you get around 151.5% of base damage.  That's still really good.

</div>You only get the out of combat mana tick if you cast an instant spell, then inner focus the mind flay, and then cast a 1.5 second spell.  Here's the cast sequence without inner focus:<br>
<br>
0: Random Previous Mindflay (Mana cost paid up front = Low regen start, leave at 5.0)<br>
3.0: Shadow Word Pain (Mana cost paid = Low regen start, leave at 8.0)<br>
4.5: GCD up, cast Mind Flay.  (Low Regen start again, leave at 9.5)<br>
7.5: Mind Flay complete, Mind Blast start<br>
9.0: Mind Blast cast (Low regen start again, leave at 14.0)<br>
<br>
As you can see, putting Inner Focus on the Shadow Word Pain does nothing for out of cast time regen, since as soon as you cast the Mind Flay after it, you enter the 5 second rule again.  Remember, Mind Flay is an instant cast DoT that requires channeling to maintain the DoT!  It is NOT the same as a 3 second cast Fireball.  Because the mana for mind flay is deducted at the start, that's when you enter the low regen state.<br>
<br>
Now if you Inner Focus your Mind Flay at 4.5 seconds, you will leave low regen at 8.0 and enter at 9.0, giving you half a tick.  Plus you wasted inner focus on a 185 mana spell rather than a 550 mana spell, and I doubt you gained an extra 365 mana in that second.<br>
<br>
At any rate, the value of Meditation scales up with you gear while Inner Focus does not, so to me that says Inner Focus is the talent to cut.  Unless of course you were lucky enough to spec Devouring Plague.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>It doesn't proc from Arcane Missiles, which is a channel spell that casts a bolt every second.  Also remember that Mind Flay ticks do not crit while Arcane Missiles can.  As a rule of thumb, if it crits, it's direct damage.  Otherwise it's periodic damage (a DoT).  We should probably add something like this to the root post because people often get confused about this point.<br>
<br>
Since that the spell from Tymbal's can crit, I'm 99% certain it will consume ISB charges and that it uses your spell crit, not the default 5%.<br>
<br>
We average one DoT tick per second in a full burn cycle with no haste, which means we average 1 proc every 25 seconds.  Interestingly enough, this gets slightly stronger if you're doing a mana intense fight or if you're dotting multiple targets, since you'll average one proc per 20 seconds.  But I can't think of any examples of the former, and for the latter you'd rather just get 80% uptime on your ashtonge trinket.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_638617"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I thought I'd share a post I made on SP.com of some work I've done with the Shadow Priest DPS spreadsheet. It should give people a good idea of what haste will do for you dps at different levels of damage and haste.<br>
<br>
Here's some quick "simulations" I did with the DPS spreadsheet that I modified a bit. It's linked <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080407091931/http://files.filefront.com/priest+dps+graphxls/;9626896;/fileinfo.html" target="_blank">here</a>. All I did was change the damage and haste values in the spreadsheet and recorded the DPS values it produced. As you can see from the graphs, there are definitely some "plateaus" at certain haste values that seem to coincide regardless of how damage you have. The right way to do this would be to model it for each point of haste at each point of damage, but I don't have the time for that . These are in done in 100 damage intervals (1000-1500) with increments of 25 haste (0-500).<br>
<br>
Sample screen of my settings while generating the data. This was the 1500 damage/500 haste calculation.<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080407091931/http://i151.photobucket.com/albums/s126/evanwill15/SampleSettings.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20080407091931im_/http://i151.photobucket.com/albums/s126/evanwill15/th_SampleSettings.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br>
<br>
Values the graphs are created from. If people want to run the simulations more rigorously, you can decrease the increments of haste and damage.<br>

</div>With more spell haste, you should end up with more mind flay ticks as well, which should increase the value of the proc.  Currently, with moderate spell haste (staff, 2x rings, bracers), mind flay has already started becoming 28-31% of my damage for a typical wws parse on many fights, which bumps me up to 1.1-1.2 ticks per second.  <br>
<br>
The consumption of ISB charges is a concern though since we rely on it so much for bumping up our DoT/Flay damage.  Hopefully a lock can check on that.  <br>
<br>
I'm paper napkin calculating ~25-30 dps from the trinket proc based on my 1.15 dot ticks per second, but may result in a much steeper penalty of lower ISB uptime, especially with multiple trinket users.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Looking over the graphs, the plateaus seem to be near 157 and 314 haste rating (nudged a bit due to lag).  These correspond to the haste needed to squeeze in one and two extra GCDs.  The graph is still pretty linear (perhaps due to the coarse granularity).

It does take some time because you have to go through and enter each haste value for each damage value. If I was better with Excel, I'd design it to plot a graph for every point of haste from 0-788 for whatever damage value you enter (Anyone now how to do this??).<br>

		<div id="post_message_638809"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I have written a macro that takes the existing version of the spread sheet and adds an additional sheet and then fills in all the values you would need to create a graph out of your own inputs.  It only goes from 1-500 haste rating at the moment but that could be set higher very easily.  This is a work in progress that I'm still tweaking but it does automate the process at least so you do not physically have to sit there and do it.  Error handling could use some work.<br>
<br>
From the excel menu go to tools select macro then go to visual basic editor.<br>
From the visual basic editor find the "Project -VBAProject" window (should be top left).<br>
In that window find the line VBAProject(priest_dps.xls) and right click on this line.<br>
Select insert from the menu that pops up and then module from the subsequent menu.<br>
Paste the following into the large window on the right:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:0px"><img src="assets/code_html.gif" border="0"></div>
	<pre class="alt2" dir="ltr" style="
		margin: 0px;
		padding: 3px;
		border: 1px inset;
		width: 694px;
		height: 418px;
		text-align: left;
		overflow: auto">Sub CreateHasteSheet()
    Sheets("Spell Data").Select
    Sheets.Add
    Sheets("Sheet1").Select
    Sheets("Sheet1").Move After:=Sheets(5)
    Sheets("Sheet1").Select
    Sheets("Sheet1").Name = "HasteGraph"
    Range("A1").Select
    ActiveCell.FormulaR1C1 = "Haste"
    Range("B1").Select
    ActiveCell.FormulaR1C1 = "DPS"
Call dps(1)

End Sub
Sub CreateHasteSheetAgain()
Call dps(1)
End Sub



Sub dps(hasterating)
If hasterating &lt;= 500 Then
    Sheets("Shadow DPS Information").Select
    Range("H32").Select
    ActiveCell.FormulaR1C1 = hasterating
    Range("I12").Select
    Selection.Copy
    Sheets("HasteGraph").Select
    Range("A" &amp; hasterating + 1).Select
    ActiveCell.FormulaR1C1 = hasterating
    Range("B" &amp; hasterating + 1).Select
    Selection.PasteSpecial Paste:=xlPasteValues, Operation:=xlNone, SkipBlanks _
        :=False, Transpose:=False
    hasterating = hasterating + 1
Call dps(hasterating)
Else
End If
End Sub</pre>
</div><br>
Once that is done switch back to the excel window.  Go to the tools menu back to macro and now hit the Macros option with the little green triangle next to it.  From the macro window that pops up select 'CreateHasteSheet' the first time and 'CreateHasteSheetAgain' for each subsequent run.  Running 'CreateHasteSheet' more than once will result in an error.  On reruns the old values will be overwritten.  Both functions are time consuming.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_638952"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Tetracycloide, thank you for the help. By using your code as an example and mashing the F1 button, I've got something put together that is fairly user friendly. It's still pretty slow so if you want to do a full sim from 0 to 788 haste at a desired spell damage value, it will take several minutes. At least you don't have to type them all in!<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">You only get the out of combat mana tick if you cast an instant spell, then inner focus the mind flay, and then cast a 1.5 second spell.  Here's the cast sequence without inner focus:<br>
<br>
0: Random Previous Mindflay (Mana cost paid up front = Low regen start, leave at 5.0)<br>
3.0: Shadow Word Pain (Mana cost paid = Low regen start, leave at 8.0)<br>
4.5: GCD up, cast Mind Flay.  (Low Regen start again, leave at 9.5)<br>
7.5: Mind Flay complete, Mind Blast start<br>
9.0: Mind Blast cast (Low regen start again, leave at 14.0)<br>
<br>
As you can see, putting Inner Focus on the Shadow Word Pain does nothing for out of cast time regen, since as soon as you cast the Mind Flay after it, you enter the 5 second rule again.  Remember, Mind Flay is an instant cast DoT that requires channeling to maintain the DoT!  It is NOT the same as a 3 second cast Fireball.  Because the mana for mind flay is deducted at the start, that's when you enter the low regen state.<br>
<br>
Now if you Inner Focus your Mind Flay at 4.5 seconds, you will leave low regen at 8.0 and enter at 9.0, giving you half a tick.  Plus you wasted inner focus on a 185 mana spell rather than a 550 mana spell, and I doubt you gained an extra 365 mana in that second.<br>
<br>
At any rate, the value of Meditation scales up with you gear while Inner Focus does not, so to me that says Inner Focus is the talent to cut.  Unless of course you were lucky enough to spec Devouring Plague.</div>

</div>I agree that without tweaking the 'wait' values the complete picture of the gains from haste will not be realized but because of the nature of the graphs that are being produced by fully stepping out haste from 1-x in single point incriments the tweaking need not be done to attach a meaningful weight to haste as a stat.<br>
<br>
All of the graphs that I have produced with the macro so far have all demonstrated the exact same behaviour which is, namely, a step wise linear function.  Adjusting the wait values in the sheet would ultimately produce a completely linear graph or at least an aproximation of one given the amount of variance in the sim itself.  That is to say the slope of the line is what matters, not the nominal DPS number that is being produced by the sim.<br>
<br>
That said adding in logic to the macro that creates the values to adjust the wait times for maximum DPS is completely possible but as long as it is just guessing and checking it would make the function more time consuming.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The weight of the stat is a function of its relative effect on DPS.  You don't need to tweak the wait stat in order to determine that value because the graph is stepwise linear.  All stepping out the wait values is going to do is smooth out the graph so it is completely linear instead of piecewise linear.  The distinction between the two is completely academic because the slope is the weight of the stat and for the linear pieces of either graph it will be the same.<br>
<br>
It does depend on what you're using the sheet for though.  I should amend my argument by saying I would only be interested in using the sheet to assign approximate stat weights that can be used to select gear.  If you are actually trying to created a DPS number to match with in game then, yes, the estimate of your DPS will require tweaking of the wait stat to remain accurate.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Then your mathlab numbers are different than the simulation in the excel sheet because that is very much not the behaviour of the simulation in the spread sheet.  In the excel sheet if the wait times are adjusted to optimal values given a specific haste rating and the DPS points at each value of haste are graph it does make it linear across the range.  This makes sense because piecewise linear implies changing intercepts, not changing slopes.<br>
<br>
What you are saying right now is that each marginal point of haste is worth a different amount, given a fixed set of other stats, depending on how much haste you have.  The simulation in the sheet indicates that each marginal point of haste is worth the same amount, given a fixed set of other stats, reguardless of how much haste you have as long as you adjust your cast timing optimally.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>A curve can be piecewise linear with a constant slope and a changing intercept.  This is what I observed building a curve out of the data produced by varying the haste value and running the sim for DPS.  Piecewise linear doesn't require different slopes because a piecewise linear equation where the disjointed segments that all have the same slopes but different intercepts will have a constant derivative across the entire range.  The slope from 0 to 250-300 is a completely different value than the instantaneous slope at any given point.<br>
<br>
Haste adding different amounts of DPS depending on how much you already is true on live, now that I've thought about it, because of the GCD lock.  Assuming 2.4 goes live as is this will no longer be the case.  My mistake.  The sheet is built with the GCD lock built in so I maintain, based on the graphs that the sheet is producing for me with its simulation, that in the sheet changing the wait values still only changes the intercepts on the various pieces in the graph and not the instantaneous slope at any given point.  Again, this is merely what I'm observing from the output of the sheet and if it's incorrect the sheet should be fixed.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Attached: simulation using 2.4 GCD, in increments of 1 haste, timestep of 0.01 seconds, 15 minute fights, across 250 haste at 10 different values of wait.  While the shapes are, overall, *similar*, they are not identical.  Essentially, as wait increases, peaks/troughs are flattened out.<br>
<br>
Note that further smoothing of the graph can be seen as wait is boosted.  However, waiting longer isn't always optimal - sometimes it does lower your DPS, while making the graph across haste closer to monotonically increasing.  Hence my stipulation that wait is not something you can simply set and have be valid across the range of hastes.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_649875"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->AD trinket is fine, for what it's worth.  I'm not sure why people are so down on it - it isn't best in slot (or even close to), it's beaten out by Icon/Head/Skull, but is competitive with Blessings (before I got a head, I swapped between Blessings and AD Exalted depending on fight - if Blessings resets a couple times, or if you multidot, AD Exalted beats it).  SotS ring isn't exactly bad either - it's a solid ring, certainly.  Neither is worth going human for (especially not the trinket - AD rep comes FAST).<br>
<br>
Re: racials - NE have highest personal damage, draenei have highest group benefit (higher mana return as well as a 1% spellhit aura).  Dwarf shadow is inferior in all respects for PvE.  Human shadow is okay - small damage boost and personal regen boost from human spirit, repgrind reduction, but inferior output in the two main categories to night elf and draenei (damage/regen).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yes, either head coupled with the Trousers will be superior to the Spellstrike set, although not by a tremendous amount.  It also has the added benefit of allowing you to change head/legs with a simple upgrade to one as opposed to having to consider teh set bonus.  There are threads on shadowpriest.com evaluating the different types of gear both pre 2.4 and post 2.4, and I urge you to check them out.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_651505"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Ceran, at first glance it looks like that WWS is collected over several hours of raid time. That would explain why the DPS time is less than 100%, since it includes downtime between trash and bosses. Probably the easiest mob to track your DPS for in that WWS is going to be Rage Winterchill, even though its a short fight. You could also contrast that with Illidari Council, as thats a longer fight with a little more movement. If you can, try to get ahold of WWS for teron, as that seems to be the benchmark most people go off of when analyzing DPS cycles.<br>
<br>
To analyze the WWS, use the "split" tab to focus on the fight you are interested in, and use the "browse" tab to highlight your contribution. <br>
<br>

<br>
With regard to dot clipping, there isn't any immediate way to read how often you are clipping your dots per se. The easiest way is to read the amount of time the fight took (look in the summary tab), and (I believe, might be wrong its late) divide by 3. Since both your dots tick every 3 seconds, the ideal fight (assuming no multi target dotting) would be (dps time)/3. The closer you are getting to that, the more confident you can be you aren't clipping your dots.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_652461"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Kalman, your graph is very interesting.  It looks like there are 2 different curves.  The higher curve is the result of proper wait times, and the lower one is the result of not waiting long enough.  Which one do you think is closer to a real world approximation? I would expect human reactions adjusting wait times on the fly to be closer to the optimal curve.  What spell damage did you assume for this simulation?<br>
<br>
There also seem to be quite sharp diminishing returns on haste, with a plateau between 150 and 200 spell haste.  That would put the sweet spot between 100 and 150.  <br>
<br>
Evanwill's numbers also show a plateau, but around 100-150.  That's one of the places where small amounts of waiting make a big difference, though.  <br>
<br>
How much +damage does it take to add 1 dps?  I'd like to try to calculate the relative usefulness of haste vs damage.  I've seen reports of 0.5 haste = 1 damage for live, all the way up to 1 haste = 1 damage for PTR. It should be easy to calculate from the graphs if I can convert from DPS to +damage.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_652470"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The graph was run at 1400 +dmg.  I suspect that human reaction will wind up somewhere in the top-middle of the bounds, as people don't tend to play perfectly; that said, the penalty for being 'close' tends to be fairly low (though not always).<br>
<br>
I don't know if Evan is running under 2.4 GCD assumptions; I was.  I expect that would make a difference in where the 'plateau' lands.  Roughly speaking, 2 +dmg = 1 +dps; on PTR, the haste:damage conversion does appear to be close to 1:1 at the 250 range,   Even at the 'plateau', it still appears to be on the order of 0.8:1.  There's also some indication that the plateau may end and past 250 it may boost back up, I need to run some more simulations.<br>
<br>
For 2.4, I basically expect +haste to be roughly 1:1 with +dmg, between the combination of it appearing very close to that value in simulations and the unsimulated benefits (motion fights have higher cast allowances.)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_654079"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'm very pleased to have found this forum... finally, people that speak my language. Shadow Priest.<br>
<br>
As a guild leader having to lead Kara runs with my newly-70's and my weekly-casuals (not very elitist... I know...), every week I've been picking up extra badges that, until news of the 2.4 badge rewards, were just burning holes in my bags. I started messing around with spell haste gear and I can confirm that you guys are right on the money with the +3 spell haste = +1 DPS that you've been kicking around in this thread -- Kudos to the math-crunching Shadows! I've found that depending on the piece of gear that I'm swapping out, it's more a matter of what am I losing to gain the haste :: and in many cases, I've come out ahead after the math-splosion (for example... the Runed Spell-cuffs vs Bands of Nefarious Deeds).<br>
<br>
Additionally, I picked up the Essence of the Martyr for my healing set (*gasp* A healing set!? not very elitist at ALL... I know...), and I found out that the Essence is on a separate CD from the Icon of the Silver Crescent. So, am I right to assume the following:<br>
<br>
In general...<br>
<br>
Icon = (155/6) + 43 = +68.83 effective<br>
Essence = (99/6) + 28 = +44.5 effective<br>
TRINKET TOTAL = +113.33<br>
<br>
... but for fights that last for 20secs or less (i.e. most trash fights)...<br>
<br>
Icon = 155 + 43 = +198<br>
Essence = 99 + 28 = +127<br>
TRINKET TOTAL = +325<br>
<br>
Since there is generally downtime between trash pulls (drinking, rezing, moving to the next pull, rebuffing, joking around on Vent, etc...), I've found that this trinket combo has dramatically increased my combat effective DPS, especially since I have both trinkets linked to every damage casting spell in my arsenal using macros (so the trinkets are being popped at every possible chance).<br>

On my warlock I used a mod called TwinTrinkets to rotate trinkets based on cooldown.  I only macroed trinkets to DOT spells though, because it's sort of a waste to pop a trinket during the last 5s of a fight.  Usually I would wind up with a trinket cooling in my bags, a trinket freshly equipped with the 30s cooldown, and a trinket ready to go for most trash pulls.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Apparently, and these are largely unsubstantiated rumors based on data mining, the Aldor one yields a +100ish damage proc for 10 seconds while the Scryer one yields a +crit rating proc (yes there are those of us who picked Scryer without considering everything and/or if we were going to raid).  Obviously the former is appealing while the latter is horrible.</div>

</div>Does anyone know if the Scryers/Aldors plotline is expected to continue in WotLK (even if it's just based on the established lore, any indicator at all)? I went Scryer basically because I'd like to make my own spellthread and I viewed the dmg vs crit thing to be simply a question of shoulder inscriptions (and I was willing to compromise optimization for a little convenience - moot point now with Nether's becoming BoE). I'm not someone who enjoys pouring money into retraining/rep grinds to min max, but if this trend clearly favoring aldors (for spriests) continues, a switch might almost be a requirement?</div>

		<div id="post_message_659977">Scryers/Aldor isn't likely to continue to be relevant in the new expansion. There's no way to go above exalted for existing characters, and it would create a need for new characters to farm "new old world" zones to catch up. It just doesn't mesh with Blizzard's expansion philosophy (the giant reset button).<br>
<br>
I don't think it's that likely lorewise either. The Scryer/Aldor conflict arc has pretty much reached its happy friendly conclusion through BT and SW storylines.<br>
<br>
So while the storyline <i>may</i> be utilized I'm sure the reputation will become meaningless. Well, once new shoulder enchants pop up, anyway.</div>

</div>1) Agree, implement a "wait value" of .9999 (&lt;1 mindflay tick at 0 haste) and decreasing the value as haste goes up.<br>
2) Toy with the priority spelllist, cause VT as higest is abit pre 2.4<br>
3) try it at multiple SPD values (1000-2000)<br>
<br>
(2 can be time consuming, therefore, loose the "random" to detimine which priority is higest, then run the simulation)</div>

		<div id="post_message_661145">The other thing to look at when doing this simulation.  I know a lot of shadow priests have begun to use partial mindflays, ie break the mindflay after 1 or 2 ticks when a higher damage spell becomes available.  Having the simulator take this into account would be interesting to see.<br>
<br>
From what I have read that decrease is due to the fact instead of waiting an extra 1 or 2 tenths of a second, the simulator does a whole mindflay instead of a mindblast or some other high dps spell.  This then actually lowers our dps.</div>

</div>Since every spell is hasted by the same percentage in 2.4, the only constants are SWP and VT duration. What you simulated is a perfect player (lag 0, reaction time 0) trying to keep up his DoTs. The decrease in DPS is just due to the spell priorities resulting in decreased DoT uptime. Which should be less of an issue if you add in randomized lag+reaction time.<br>
Also, I suggest using SWP&gt;VT just for the sake of the simulation. If VT&gt;SWP, SWP downtime can be as high as hasted 4.5 seconds (mind flay+VT), which probably happens most often at 170 haste. Clipping mind flays would also make the graph more linear.</div>

</div>The simplest way to make the graph more linear is to use what most spriests do - we'll wait for a cooldown/refresh, rather than spend 3s flaying, if the wait will be short enough.  I don't have programmatic ways to determine wait, but I simulated it across the lower haste range (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080306025117/http://radiationnow.net/wow/hastelab/haste_vs_wait.jpg" target="_blank">HasteLAB graph of haste/wait relationship</a>) and you can see there are pretty clear upper bounds, so a programmatic relation should be findable (as well as the bounding function).</div>

</div>I'm gonna try to incoperate this into the simulation as well as some other cleaning up, I still don't know how I can make it smart enough to clip spells so for if it put up a spell it won't recast it untill after it has fallen off completely, including dots.  I realize now the timestep size isn't important and I can set veriable timesteps based on what just happened, basically I think I can make it run about 10 times faster meaning longer simulations are more possible.</div>

</div>Suppose you want to cast both Mind Blast and Shadow Word: Pain at the same time.  In either case, you cast the other spell 1.5 seconds later.  The question is...  Which spell loses less damage from casting late?  In the case of Mind Blast with a 6 second cooldown (effectively 7.5 with cast time), you lose 1.5 / 7.5 = 20% of a Mind Blast's damage.  For Pain, all future ticks occur half a second later, so you lose half a tick, which is 1/16 (or 1/18 with 2T6).<br>
<br>
20% of a mind blast is probably around 600 damage and half a pain tick is around 400 damage, so you lose less damage casting blast first and pain second.</div>

</div>In my case what I'm doing so far is keeping Mind Flay as the benchmark and keeping the original spell priority then compairing (DamageX)/(CastTime+ExtraTime) with Mind Flays DPS.  Basically if the dps of the other spell even with the extra time is greater than mind flays it waits and casts that spell instead of moving on to the next spell in the chain.  In any case while I still have some tweeking to do with making sure it's giving proper dps numbers so far it apears as though there is a 1:1 ratio between SP and Haste and at this point it is likely it is at best a 1:1 ratio.</div>

		<div id="post_message_662776">I've been following this topic pretty closely and I'm excited about the addition of haste on 2.4 gear.<br>
<br>
My question deals with primarily with how hast actually affects mindflay. Mindflay is regularly a 3 second channeled dot, correct? So will haste reduce the duration of the mindflay? E.g. With 10% haste reduction instead of getting a MF tick every second, would i get a MF tick every 0.9 seconds (making the entire channeling of the MF spell 2.7 seconds?). Additionally, with 20% reduction I would get a MF tick every 0.8 seconds?<br>
<br>
So, assuming the above is correct, the MSD buff would effectively double my spell haste if I were to be at 20% reduction already, making a MF tick occur every 0.6 seconds and the entire cast complete at 1.8 seconds.<br>
<br>
Does this make sense or do I have the concept of haste totally messed up?</div>

It's also great fun running that encounter.  For a 5-man group, you could do the encounter 5 times in a single day.

		<div id="post_message_663241">I cleaned up my code a lot and made it choose to wait on MB and SWD cool downs when the overall damage would be higher.  The code still sticks to a VT&gt;SWP&gt;MB&gt;SWD&gt;MF order in general but given the trend of the graph to get more linear each time I make it smarter I think it's pretty safe to say that the 1:1 ratio of SP to Haste is pretty accurate.  Some disadvantages of my code right now is that dot's don't "tick," they are up front damage with cooldowns equal to the duration of the dot.  Because of this it can't clip dots or MF.  Unfortunately the more time steps I put in the longer it takes to simulate.  Anyways here is the most recent graph I've come up with:<br>

At this point I'm just wondering how long it'll take someone to make a mod that tells you which spell you should cast next.  Because if we can model it mathematically then there is no reason why someone couldn't just make a mod to do it on the fly in game.<br>
<br>
Ok I ran my simulator again this time with the right equations for waiting for mind flay and swd and compared the results to that of spell damage.  Both start with 1000 spell damage, the top blue line represents increases in spell damage ranging from 1000-1500 total while the red line represents increases in spell haste running from 0-500.<br>

 Admittedly I am doing a simple visual estimation of gradiant - but it is clear that there is a much bigger increase for those points. Is that graph taking into account lag btw?  <br>

 Finally, I think the discussion on haste gear is generally going to apply to t6+ SP's, who when raiding, should easily be clipping more like 1400 dmg. Does that steepen the curve?</div>

</div>Yes. A higher initial value of +damage will increase the marginal value of haste, and vice versa.<br>
<br>
The most valuable simulation would, as far as I can tell, show the slope (ie marginal return) of the +damage and +haste lines at chosen intercepts, which would be better represented in a table than by a graph.<br>
<br>
Ugly example:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:0px"><img src="assets/code_html.gif" border="0"></div>
	<pre class="alt2" dir="ltr" style="
		margin: 0px;
		padding: 3px;
		border: 1px inset;
		width: 694px;
		height: 162px;
		text-align: left;
		overflow: auto">Spell damage\Haste     0           100           200           300           400

1200                0.5\0.49   0.51\0.48         etc

1300                0.5\0.51

1400                  etc

1500</pre>
</div>Where x.x\x.x represents added dps from 1 additional damage\haste.<br>
<br>
This would require some serious smoothing of the results obviously, since they are jagged. It won't show any small drop offs in the simulated material like above, but I firmly believe such dropoffs only exist in a theoretical vacuum. The only reason increased haste should ever lower dps is because it tricks the simulator/player into making suboptimal decisions.</div>

That's not quite right - based on the formula every point of haste should add as much dps as the last.<br>
<br>
The percentage increase in dps will get smaller each time, but that's the case with spell damage as well.<br>
<br>
<br>
I think the main reason that haste is giving dimishing returns is down to the random latency added to each spell (assuming the simulations take this into account).  An average latency of 0.15 seconds added to a 1.5 second spell is a smaller proportion than the same 0.15 seconds added to the hasted casting/GCD time.<br>

</div>Actually you would need to have a version being casted for 1.5/2/3 ticks because it isn't possible to cut the spell off less than halfway through due to GCD restraints.  I have my doubts that cutting off after 1.5 ticks would ever be worthwhile because for an extra half second of chanelling, you get a full extra tick of damage.</div>

<br>
So while I was catching up on the past week of posts and such, I started thinking about my in-game experiences of late with +damage, +haste, virtual mana, etc...<br>
<br>
If spell haste increases the channeling speed of Mind Flay (which it does), and DoT upkeep is the most mana intensive part of the casting cycle (especially maintaining VT to keep the mana buyback up)... there HAS to be a point where, during a standard casting cycle, enough +haste and +damage allows the priest to pump so much mana-cheap Mind Flay during a 15sec period that they cease to use mana. Where is this point?? How much +damage/+haste would you need?? In what mix?? Is that mix reachable??<br>
<br>
And of course... if we're returning THAT much mana to the party, everyone in the party loves us.<br>
<br>
And that's what it's all about.<br>
<br>
The love.<br>

		<div id="post_message_664104">Since VT returns 5%, the obvious thing to think is 20 DPM. However, if you account for other sources of mana regeneration (Meditation, MP5 gear, potions, Spellsurge, etc.) as well as the fact that your mana only ever needs to be (effectively) unlimited for the duration of a 10-15-minute fight, it's less than that. Yesterday, I killed Al'ar without using a single potion, and my group members loved me for going pretty much all out the whole fight, but I certainly don't come close to 3.5k +damage.</div>

</div>Not true, because different spells have different efficiencies.  Grasping wildly at numbers, if my VT will yield 3500 damage and my MF yields 2100, with MF costing 192 base mana, while VT costs 425 mana, the mana returned per cast is obviously very different.  Since VT runtime is constant (once per 15 seconds regardless of spellhaste) while MF time decreases with haste, haste obviously increases the number of efficient spells you can fit inside of an inefficient spell.  If VT is still net-negative while MF is net-positive mana, haste increases the ratio of MF to VT, raising your efficiency.<br>
<br>
It's basically irrelevant, though.<br>
<br>

		<div id="post_message_664807">Alright, I just used numbers that are halfway straight out of my ass for the sake of the fact that I forgot math. The chart given by Cheeba shows damage increase through adding only +damage or +haste. Using a bit of rounding, and maybe a couple guesses since the chart doesn't have lines, I came up with a starting DPS at 1000/0 to be 880. The end number at 1500/0 came up as 1100. (As I said, some rounding. Coming up with generalizations here, not trying to land on pluto.) At 1000/500, it looked to be about 1030. <br>
<br>
Increasing +damage by 500 yeilded 220 DPS in this simulation, while increasing haste by 500 yeilded 150. Now my math is a bit crappy these days, but the calculator is still spot on. I'm coming up with 1 point of spell damage being equal to roughly 1.47 spell haste. Yes, these numbers aren't quite "best fit" lines, however I don't see the best fit from the given data being very far off. I'm sure someone can clean it up some, but it looks to me that you can trade spell damage for haste as long as the trade doesn't exceed 1 point of damage lost for every 1.5 points of haste. At least, this is my understanding. Anyone care to idiot check me/add in their own observations before I run off and increase my haste even more than I already am?<br>

</div>Interesting.  You're getting significantly less benefit from haste vs. spellpower than I was seeing.<br>
<br>
The wait/nonwait issue's not that unusual.  I'm reasonably certain that the metric you're using for how to trade off not casting may not be ideal - you aren't losing the whole cooldown time because sooner or later cooldown clashes will result in forced delay of MB cast.  Try it with a fixed maximum wait time and see if you see similar patterns to my simulator?</div>

</div> I LoL'd ;-)<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
  In terms of haste, the above results seem to be slightly nonchalant about it. Get it as long as the item is not going to lose more that half the haste in spell dmg.  I thought the GCD changes would have had a much greater effect.<br>
<br>
  <br>
 An unrelated question: Ever since the dawn of time my initial cast sequence has been VT, SWP, (then VE  but ignore that) etc.  I did this in part to give the tank a little bit more time for extra aggro and I guess in part because i pull mobs that way.  <br>
<br>
  I noticed another shadowpriest in my raid does it the other way round, I guess I lose out on 1.5 seconds of SW:P early on - but then VT is not applied until 3 seconds in.<br>
<br>
I am not describing this well.   <br>
<br>
Either:            0 sec SW:P...1.5s-GCD....VTcast....3sec VT applied<br>
Or my way      0sec cast VT 1.5 sec VT applied 1.6 sec SW:P applied.<br>
<br>
 Now, there is possible loss of VT mana the first method - since if any lag made VT apply at 3.05 sec it would not be up for the first tick.<br>
<br>
  Can anyone suggest some maths to tell me if I am correct or incorrect in procedure.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Ok so sometimes I really do think I'm retarded.  I had it additive for dps modifiers instead of multiplicative.  I changed it around and now I'm getting numbers that agree with the spread sheet.  Let me know if this is right:<br>
<br>
(1.15*ShadowForm) (1 + .02*Darkness) (1 + .02*SW) (1.1*CoS) (1.05*Mis) (1 + .2*ImpSB)<br>
<br>
If it is then this is the new graph which would mean haste and sp are almost exactly the same for us in 2.4:<br>
<br>

</div>That looks more reasonable.  Definitely matches the theorycrafting as well, putting 1 haste at roughly 1 damage.  Of course damage looks very slightly better still (better DPM and the tradeoff is 12 spell damage versus 10 haste from epic gems).  However, haste is definitely competitive enough that it's worth taking.  In fact, the 6 spell damage, 5 haste orange gem might be a better choice if it fills socket bonuses.  There's just one problem...  We can't take yellow gem slots in reasonable quantities without losing mystical skyfire diamond.<br>
<br>
In 2.4, <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=25893"><span><span class="bluename">[Mystical Skyfire Diamond]</span></span></a> gives 320 haste rating for 6 seconds (according to the tooltip) and the proc rate is unchanged.  Still has 45 second internal cooldown.  This works out to one proc per minute, or an average of 32 bonus haste rating (worth roughly 32 spell damage).<br>
<br>
Is there a viable metagem alternative to mystical skyfire that lets us use yellow slots for pyrestones?  The new <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=35503"><span><span class="bluename">[Ember Skyfire Diamond]</span></span></a> has a requirement we're guaranteed to hit and costs 18 spell damage.  Each <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=35760"><span><span class="purplename">[Reckless Pyrestone]</span></span></a> we use instead of <a class="forumitemlink" target="_blank" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32196"><span><span class="purplename">[Runed Crimson Spinel]</span></span></a> costs us 1 spell damage  Each blue gem is a 6 spell damage loss, so we need to make up 18 + yellow slots + 6*blue slots in socket bonuses.  This seems like it might not be possible even with the gear in sunwell, but maybe I'm missing some new pieces which are very heavy on yellow slots.<br>
<br>
Summary: Haste is good but we're still chained to using Spinels.<br>
<br>
Edit: Actually that should be a 16 spell damage cost because +2% int = +50 int = .5% crit = 11 crit rating which is roughly worth 2 spell damage.</div>

</div>It's not quite that simple.  Lets say your standard flay is 2.75 seconds.  With the proc up, your flay is now 2.28 seconds. The proc occurs at the start of the spell cast, meaning you have a full 2.75 second non-hasted flay.  When it ends, you have 3.25 seconds left on the focus buff.  That's enough for 2 hasted flays but not 3.  So it will turn 5.5 seconds of cast time into 4.56 seconds, giving you 1 extra second of cast time.  Effectively the proc was only worth a third of a mind flay in this case.<br>
<br>
Of course if you proc focus after an instant cast spell, you'll have 4.625 seconds of time to cast spells with the hasted buff, so if you end up casting a mind flay at the very end of the window, you could end up fitting 8 seconds of non-focus hasted spells in 6.8 seconds of hasted time.  This gets even better if focus procs at the end of mind blast or touch, because you get a full 6 seconds, plus however long your final mind flay takes.</div>

</div>Then take out the resists for the sake of theory crafting. The usefullness of the graph is to see where the "slopes" are. So we have some "prime" haste values we can work towards.<br>
<br>
+1dmg == +haste<br>
Its true on an average, but certainly not at ever haste value, the graph should show some values where haste is less then 1 dmg and some where haste adds more then 1 dmg. Take out the choppiness and we get a much clearer view.<br>
<br>
at +1dmg == +haste, its still much better to take DMG over haste, cause when fighting more then 1 mob, +dmg wins bigtime.</div>

</div>It's worth noting that the more haste you have, the better Mystical Skyfire is, because less of the proc is wasted on unhasted time.  That is, if the buff lasts 4 seconds and you proc it on a mind flay when your flays take 3 seconds, you have 1 second to use it, so you only get one hasted spell.  But if your mind flays are 2.5 seconds, you'll have 1.5 seconds of haste buff, so you can cast some instant cast spell (invoking a close to 1 second GCD) and the cast a hasted mind flay afterward, so you get two hasted spells.<br>
<br>
Also, the spell data on wowhead definitely says 6 seconds: <a href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?spell=32837" target="_blank">Spell Focus Trigger - Spells - World of Warcraft</a><br>
<br>
Do we know if the tooltip is bugged or the buff?  A 4 second duration will bring the value down to 24 spell damage guaranteed, and probably closer to 20 (but increasing towards 24 as you have more spell haste).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Against that however, the more haste you have, the better +dmg becomes (relatively speaking).  So the +14 dmg 2% int would be worth comparatively more.<br>

I'm not sure which effect would be bigger, but it could be that the MSD becomes less useful as you get more haste.<br>
<br>
One point to note is that if it pushes your haste rating above 780ish (i.e. reducing the GCD to 1 second), there will be very little additional benefit beyond that point.  That would be a huge amount of haste however.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

If I compiled it into a program I'm sure it would run faster but I wrote it to run in mathematica which is a program that is quite similar to matlab.  I really don't think that at this point it would be valuable to do anything more with the program since the purpose of it, that is find the value of haste rating in terms of spell power, has largely been accomplished.  What would probably be better would be to start now looking at specific gear sets and then either using it to calculate specific dps or to use it to determine what gemming would be ideal. I would imagine in either case that Aevie's and Mefadin's lists from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080415085053/http://shadowpriest.com/viewtopic.php?t=9844" target="_blank">Shadowpriest.com</a> would hold all the answers anyone has about haste and the gear they should be going for in sunwell.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I am a little disappointed in this nerf. Was there a pvp motivation behind nerfing MSF? In pve raiding I think SPs are the only ones that are using it (or, should be using it) and it seems hard to believe that a specific pve raid dps nerf to Shadow Priests was necessary... at all. I was kinda hoping there would be a new gem that would fit for SPs <i>better</i> than the MSF of 2.3 although I have no idea what an "ideal" gem would be for us.

<br>
If it stays at 4, it's a tossup whether ESD or MSD is better - MSD probably wins out if you can use the single blue for MSD to net a meaningful socket bonus, while ESD probably wins out if you can get socket bonuses out of haste/dmg gems.  Looking through the Sunwell gear, it seems like the only item where a blue nets you a socket bonus is T6 boots, while you can legitimately use dmg/haste gemming in quite a few locations to net socket bonuses.<br>
<br>
Based on the gear trend, and the current state of MSD, I think we'll wind up shifting to ESD (as mediocre as it is) just so we can use orange gems.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Well, if we're discussing socketing for the theoretical "perfect" amount of haste then it is relevant. If I'm reading the graph on the previous page correctly, at around 150 haste it starts to get "worse" in comparison to spell damage. Yes, it's still a damage increase, however, if you're socketing the haste/damage gem to get a bonus and your haste is below 150, the haste is worth more than if you were socketing the same item but you already had 200 haste.<br>
<br>
If the ratio of haste:damage is 1:1 when you have less than 150 haste, and 1:.8 or 1:.9 when you have greater than 150 haste, it most certainly makes a difference in gem choices.<br>
<br>
I could be reading the graph wrong though.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Plus the whole thing for the 'perfect' amount revolves around having a 'clean' rotation and not having your abilities come out of CD or drop off the target at weird times where you can't possibly put them up again without a dps decrease etc. The perfect amount refers to an equal increase in haste where I believe 2 flays fit perfectly between MBs etc. I haven't got intensely into Haste just yet and all my knowledge is based on spreadsheet, lists, and theories at SP.com and not here. I'm rather new here on EJ.com<br>
<br>
The general thing I'm seeing is that haste is getting a boost from .508 to a full 1 or very close, that and it affect GCDs so the simple math of 'more is better' doesn't really apply to this very VERY dynamic stat, which relies on the +dmg you have at any given time.<br>
<br>
for example you just said it's always 1 to 1 haste to dmg.. well can't I have 0 dmg and 2k haste and do more dps then? I somehow think that theory breaks right there. The numbers vary greatly every time you add more of each.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Plus the whole thing for the 'perfect' amount revolves around having a 'clean' rotation and not having your abilities come out of CD or drop off the target at weird times where you can't possibly put them up again without a dps decrease etc. The perfect amount refers to an equal increase in haste where I believe 2 flays fit perfectly between MBs etc. I haven't got intensely into Haste just yet and all my knowledge is based on spreadsheet, lists, and theories at SP.com and not here. I'm rather new here on EJ.com<br>
<br>
The general thing I'm seeing is that haste is getting a boost from .508 to a full 1 or very close, that and it affect GCDs so the simple math of 'more is better' doesn't really apply to this very VERY dynamic stat, which relies on the +dmg you have at any given time.<br>
<br>
for example you just said it's always 1 to 1 haste to dmg.. well can't I have 0 dmg and 2k haste and do more dps then? I somehow think that theory breaks right there. The numbers vary greatly every time you add more of each.</div>

</div>No one said anything of the sort.  That said, it looks to be ~1:1 for the first 200 or so haste, and converts quite favorably up to very high levels; using a 1:1 or 1:.9 approximation for quick evals is probably just fine.<br>
<br>
The MB MF MF ideal is a bunch of shit, honestly.  None of the simulation work cheeba or I have done has come anywhere near showing a spike in DPS at the "ideal haste" point because cooldown clashes, lag, and a number of other things will break that ideal cycle anyway.  Not to mention the whole concept of a waitstate and clipped flays making MB MF MF less important that it's presented to be.<br>
<br>
Looking at the itemization, generally you'd be trading 6 damage for 5 haste and a socket bonus... and the socket bonuses seem to be 3-5 damage in and of themselves.  I think that haste/dmg gemming for socket bonuses will be quite common for spriests.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>That's only true on items without blue sockets, which is almost none of them right now.  Each blue sockets still trades you 6 damage for a socket bonus (2 damage) and either 7 stamina or 4 spirit.  That seems never worth it to me.  Even if the piece had two yellow and one blue socket for +5 damage, you have a net loss of 2 spell damage for 4 spirit or 7 stamina.  The only blue socket you use is the T6 helm, because it's -1 damage for +7 stamina, or twice as good.<br>
<br>
Are there enough pieces with only yellow or red sockets that you can gain the 6 to 10 spell damage loss by trading Mystical Skyfire Diamond for +14 spell damage, +2% int?  I just don't see it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Basically everything in Sunwell is blue socket free.  T6 boots are the only exception, having a single blue socket in exchange for +2dmg.  T6 wrist is R, T6 waist is Y.<br>
<br>
Leggings of Calamity: RRY +5dmg<br>
Pantaloons of Growing Strife: RYY +5dmg<br>
Gloves of Tyri's Power: RY +4dmg<br>
Helm of Arcane Purity: MR +5dmg<br>
Robes of Ghostly Hatred: RRY +5dmg<br>
Shoulderpads of Knowledge's Pursuit: RY +5dmg<br>
Sunfire items are RRR and RR<br>
<br>
The 6-10 damage loss vs. MSD is lowered by not having a worthwhile blue socket bonus anymore (once you replace T6 hat, of course), and having a number of worthwhile yellow bonuses.  If we backgem as well, you can add:<br>
<br>
Absolution Handguards (Y, +2 dmg bonus)<br>
<br>
Now:<br>
<br>
34dmg/5haste or 36 dmg is obvious.<br>
22dmg/5haste or 24dmg is obvious.<br>
5haste/8dmg or 12 dmg is probably 50/50.<br>
27dmg/10haste or 36 dmg less so.<br>
<br>
So out of our new items, they basically all do at least as well gemmed haste as damage, and most do better gemmed haste.  Even at a fairly low haste valuation, 2-3 pieces of Sunwell loot will wipe out the benefit of MSD vs ESD; that's without accounting for the loss you take to gem a blue gem to activate MSD (1 damage, if you have T6 helm, which I'm assuming you do, 6 dmg if you don't).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Speaking as someone with a fairly high eval of haste: I won't be regemming my T6 gloves.  That's just silly.  I might consider picking up the T6 legs and using them on a shadow token, but that's really hard to justify - an extra leg enchant plus wasting the LCE/3xspinel I'm running as is?  Since ESD has the easiest requirement EVER (&gt;3 red), there's no real reason to regem a 50/50.  <br>
<br>
Keeping the T6 bonus as you gear is going to be interesting, for sure - on the brightish side, the tokens drop before any of the H/C/S/G replacement items do, so you can probably get a belt/bracer/boot before you lose a T6 piece.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

You have placed a ; after your while loop. So the things within the block won't execute. After fixing that, it still won't work. This is because you are not modifying your variables with the globalcd() function. You are passing them, but not passing the modified values back. The lovely world of pointers comes here into play. Your globalcd decleration should look like:<br>
<br>
void globalcd(int *vt, int *swp, int *swd, int *mb, int *ve, int *t, int gcd)<br>

globalcd(&amp;vt, &amp;swp, &amp;swd, &amp;mb, &amp;ve, &amp;t, gcd);<br>
<br>
And now modifying a variable within the globalcd function will look like:<br>
<br>
*mb=*mb+gcd;<br>
<br>
I suggest The C programming language SE to learn about pointers.<br>
<br>
And if you do this all correctly you would end up with 100 haste and 360000 duration with an output like:<br>
<br>

		<div id="post_message_675049"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I have a bunch of code improvement suggestions I almost sent in a PM, but I think there are enough programmers here that this would be generally useful.<br>
<br>
A) Your haste formula is incorrect.  At least use the 15.7 rating to haste percent conversion (and be careful with your reconversion of float to int).  Also, haste is not subtractive, so GCD = 15000 - 10*haste_percent isn't correct.  You want GCD = (int) (15000 / (1.0 + haste_percent * .01)).<br>
<br>
B) You are passing around too much data to function calls.  Create a structure to hold all your spell cooldowns and just pass in one pointer (or reference in C++) to that structure to the function that accrues time.  It will be much faster.  If you have access to C++, make inline the accrual function for extra speed.<br>
<br>
C) The data structure makes you do too much arithmetic.  Rather than increasing the cooldown on each of 6 spells, just increment the current point in time.  Whenever you cast a spell, update the current timestamp and ONLY that spell's cooldown.  Your loop will then check which of your spells have cooled down by the current time.<br>
<br>
For example suppose it's time 5 and everything is cooled down (all cooldown values are &lt;= 5).  You cast mind blast and then update the current time to 5 + GCD = 6.5 and the mind blast cooldown to 5 + GCD + 5.5 seconds.  Next loop step you check which spells have cooldowns before 6.5 seconds, and so on.<br>
<br>
D) The Mind Flay call should use a time of 2*GCD rather than two calls, by the way<br>
<br>
E) If you want useful results, you'll need support for lag and for logic that has the program wait for up to 1 second for thing like Mind Blast to cooldown rather than Mind Flay.  The precise logic for this is really complicated to do correctly for all cooldowns, by the way, so if it just works for Mind Blast that's good enough.<br>
<br>
If your do all of A-D, you'll have a guaranteed speed up of 6x, and probably more like 10x.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_675336"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I have been reading the discussion here about spell haste and wanted to chime in my thoughts about finding a conversion value between it and damage.  Spellhaste improves DPS, there's no doubt, however it comes with several "but"s.  But it depends on new optimal casting cycles.  But it's more affected by latency.  But there's times where it's worthless.  <br>
<br>
Casting cycle:<br>
<br>
This isn't really news to anyone: the perceived, simulated DPS improvements spell haste gives versus the actual DPS improvements depend on how closely the new cycles are adhered to (whereas the benefits from spell damage/crit/hit are more direct).  Simulation can find tweaks like, "In scenario X, you want to cast A before B; in scenario Y, B before A".  These small improvements add up to significant advantages for spellhaste in terms of DPS output, which gives it a higher value of spell damage.  However these small improvements can be very tricky to catch, whereas pre-2.4 haste was easy to figure out for spriests; it gets considerably more complex when the GCD shrinks as well.  A human undergoing the same scenarios just isn't going to have the same precision in timing and immediate decision making to adhere to what's optimal on paper 100% of the time.  Nobody can be expected to always make each one of those decisions correctly in realtime (maybe a future Spriest Spellhaste addon can help solve this).  The difference this brings may be very marginal in the local scope, but certainly adds up over time, and will vary fight to fight, person to person, latency to latency.  In the end it affects the DPS value we're applying to spellhaste as a stat.<br>
<br>
Lag:<br>
<br>
Simple enough.  If a player with high latency had a 1000 DPS spell that was a 20 sec cast and a 1000 DPS spell with a 1.5 sec cast, the 20sec spell would perform better due to less time where the server's waiting for the next command to come through (recent changes have alleviated this is my understanding, but it is still there).  Through the same concept, spell haste has you casting more often in a fight, so the effectiveness of your DPS varies more depending on lag.<br>
<br>
Spell haste no good here:<br>
<br>
When the player is busy moving from / being CC'd by a fight mechanic--which is fairly common--the value of spell haste effectively drops to nothing.  Spelldamage keeps some of its worth during these times with dots ticking.  How is that going to be accounted for when finding that 1 haste = X dmg conversion?  We could start to look for amounts of "time unable to cast" as a metric, and now this is beginning to sound suspiciously like the problem holy priests face with calculating time in/out of the 5SR for finding a value for spirit.  Would spell haste need a similar chart of % time spent casting for a given fight?  I'd say so, as we're trying to equate it to +dmg, and we are sacrificing nominal amounts of +dmg for haste, and that +dmg lost could've been utilized through VT/SWP for the moments in fights where we can't cast and haste is doing nothing for us.  Spirit is certainly a stat that has diverging opinions on its point-for-point worth (for holy priests that is), and spell haste is affected by a similar hard-to-pin-down variable of time spent casting/not casting.  This says to me that at best it will be similar to spirit in terms of having an agreed-upon value.  <br>
<br>
<br>
In other words, I think we need to keep in mind that a spellhaste &lt;==&gt; spell damage value will never be precise.  I think the best that can be agreed upon is "Spell haste is about equal to X-Y spell damage, but it depends".  Spell haste is a stat that sees a variable amount of its potential "wasted" in practice, due to its benefits being far more susceptible (than spelldmg) to effects like lag and unavoidably non-ideal casting cycles.  Then add in fight mechanics that can negate the effects of haste (but not so much that of +dmg) for certain %s of the fight, which is a very difficult value to pin down.  We can definitely find a range for it, with the top end assuming a low% of time spent not casting and as close to the "ideal" cycle as possible, and the low end a larger % of time not casting and/or suboptimal cycles.  <br>
<br>
I don't mean to torpedo people's venture of finding a conversion, but just wanted to see if everyone was in agreement that spell haste is ultimately an "it depends" stat when it comes to assigning a value to it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Yes I realize my capped hit rating is less than desireable, but I can get it up to about 74-76... (Its a matter of switching out trinkets)  I can put it back. I just didn't wanna lose either epic trinket, because the one i'm replacing it with is some "occulus eye" blue item<br>

I did follow a lot of the socket bonus things, because i tried to tally up the fact that (for instance the headpiece) if i aded 9 spl dmg and negated the socket bonus - i'd come out with less dmg.  This way I get 11, vs 9 from the runed.<br>

		<div id="post_message_675403"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Er.  No, you're basically completely wrong.<br>
<br>
The casting cycle does *not* become more complex.  In fact, it arguably becomes easier to adhere to; I know one of my biggest problems is having the GCD not *quite* expired when my spell goes off, if I don't catch it, where I'll lose a half second to thinking I'm casting when in reality I was still under GCD.  In 2.4, this issue basically goes away.  The decisions are *not* hard, being essentially a chain of yes/no questions (VT up with &gt;1.5?  MB on CD?  SWD on CD?  SWP up?  VT up with &gt;2.5?  MB off CD in next ~second?  SWD off CD in next ~second?  SWP out in next ~second?  OK, mindflay - potentially clip flay, which means rerun that chain after 1 GCD).  If you can't do this chain in your head, you're not a good shadow priest no matter how little haste you have.  Haste does not change or complicate the chain; it changes the order of answers, but the chain remains accurate.<br>
<br>
Lag is of minimal concern these days.<br>
<br>
You also forgot to analyze points where spell haste is very good in your "no good here" analysis.<br>
<br>
To over-simplify, take for example a fight with an "on" window of 15 seconds and an off window of 15 seconds.  A player with zero haste gets 2 MBs off at best; a player with enough haste to reach 1.25s cast time (314 haste rating) gets 3 MBs off.  While that's obviously an extreme example, it is also generally applicable to fights with phases - sometimes that haste will get you off one extra cooldown-controlled spell, which is usually more benefit than equivalent spelldamage (less true as phase length increases, of course).<br>
<br>
So, overall, no, conversion is fine, just like all other stat conversions, as long as you apply intelligence to it.    Sometimes it will be better than the conversion, sometimes worse, but overall the conversion is more or less accurate.  It's not like it's the first stat with widely varying value (+hit on trash vs. bosses vs. bosses after 16% is already reached, for example).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>You've made quite a few sub-optimal slotting, gemming, talent, and gearing choices. Without simply listing all of them, here are the main things you really need to improve on:<br>
<br>
1. Where you can pick spelldamage in your gear, pick spelldamage. This applies to gems (spellcrit and intellect gems are useless in comparison to the gains you'd see from ignoring set bonus and going for spelldamage), enchants (bracers specifically, though investing in soulfrost would be a good idea too), and some of your choices in gear (you mention you have Occulus of the hidden eye, use that over the Skyguard trinket). <br>
<br>
Since you're under the hit cap, gemming towards spellhit on some of those yellow slots wouldn't be a bad idea. Also note that spell penetration is almost completely useless in a PvE environment. <br>
<br>
Try to shift almost all your gems to +9 damage when you can reach the hit cap without gemming for it. The only place it doesn't make sense to do is when picking up a socket bonus gives you the same amount of +damage.<br>
<br>
<br>
2. Your talents could use a little cleanup. You want to have inner focus, pairing it up with pain when it's up is a decent gain in longevity for one point. Also, you really ought to max shadow reach. Dumping Imp VE is probably the easiest way to achieve both those goals.<br>
<br>
<br>
3. Fill out your pants and boots with enchants. Some spellthread and even a cheap vitality (or boar's speed) will be easy ways to increase your damage and longevity.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

  In short, we carry on with the exact same set of decisions we made pre-haste, only faster. Seeing as I am usually at least one spell ahead of myself (I need to do VT next and then MB and SWD are both up... etc) this does not seem even slighty of trouble.<br>
<br>
<br>
  As I read the OP, you claim that  a hasted SP's damage is more downgraded by periods of *silence* than a +damage SP's damage.  (hope that makes sense. Hard to word neatly.)<br>
  <br>
  I may not be the sharpest tool in the box, but DPS is DPS ==&gt; If you have DPS of 2000 and stop casting for 4 seconds  then you 'miss' 8000 damage. It could not matter less upon what this 2000 DPS is based.  The reason we use dmg as the standard is because it translates to DPS. So does haste - though at a different rate.  (i.e. we SHOULD say haste is worth 0.4 DPS and dmg worth 0.45DPS etc etc etc*.)  Therefore I simply do not see what he said to be true. <br>
<br>
 <br>
  However - to an extent this does apply to your 'on-value' logic.  Because MB is such a boost to DPS it is more applicable than his example.  Still not a factor that, imho, makes haste more valuable than the DPS graphs show.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">You've made quite a few sub-optimal slotting, gemming, talent, and gearing choices. Without simply listing all of them, here are the main things you really need to improve on:<br>
<br>
1. Where you can pick spelldamage in your gear, pick spelldamage. This applies to gems (spellcrit and intellect gems are useless in comparison to the gains you'd see from ignoring set bonus and going for spelldamage), enchants (bracers specifically, though investing in soulfrost would be a good idea too), and some of your choices in gear (you mention you have Occulus of the hidden eye, use that over the Skyguard trinket). <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Since you're under the hit cap, gemming towards spellhit on some of those yellow slots wouldn't be a bad idea. Also note that spell penetration is almost completely useless in a PvE environment. <br>
<br>
Try to shift almost all your gems to +9 damage when you can reach the hit cap without gemming for it. The only place it doesn't make sense to do is when picking up a socket bonus gives you the same amount of +damage.<br>
<br>
<br>
2. Your talents could use a little cleanup. You want to have inner focus, pairing it up with pain when it's up is a decent gain in longevity for one point. Also, you really ought to max shadow reach. Dumping Imp VE is probably the easiest way to achieve both those goals.<br>
<br>
<br>
3. Fill out your pants and boots with enchants. Some spellthread and even a cheap vitality (or boar's speed) will be easy ways to increase your damage and longevity.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>1. OK pant enchants.. (I will grab one asap) - I did put (2) +8 spell hit rating in there I figure that would work out better.. So that was a no go huh.  <br>
<br>
I was swapping shoes, trinkets out and on a certain combo I was blasting in at over 100Hit rating. (good god)<br>
<br>
2. Ok. i'll trash the skygaurd and go back to the "eye"<br>
<br>
3.  Innerfocus with SWrd: Pain.  I figured inner focus was really just a way to get a free cast and a "maybe chance" at a spell crit... if shadow word pain is not a "Crittable" spell (where as shadow word death is) - I guess ill have to read more into that tall spec... And if i crit on a shadow word Death and it doesn't kill my target - I can possibly kiss my own ass good bye. lol  (Fried Priest anyone?)<br>
<br>
"This applies to gems (spellcrit and intellect gems are useless in comparison to the gains you'd see from ignoring set bonus and going for spelldamage), "  - - - Is it because priests are not crit based? Or does that just go for the holy side?<br>
<br>
4.  Yes, I can dump Imp VE true.  I should put them in Blackout for Lady vash adds in ssc...is what my Gleader mentioned.<br>
<br>
5.  If I can obtain the min cap hit rating by just a trinket or boat swap - then put the +to dmg gems (forgetting the socket bonus) that sounds like what's being suggested.  (I listened to my former guild leader on obtaining the socket bonuses and it had made sense)..  so if i put diff color gems negating the socket bonus (+4) and put a 9 in there - won't i be missing the +4, with that mere 9?  When I could have 12 total?<br>
<br>
I hope that made sense.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

When 2.4 comes out the only people who will be able to actually make the choice between pure damage and spell haste will be people who aren't in sunwell, meaning exactly what we have now.  It's been pretty well established not only through theory craft but though real examples that the haste builds do the same dps as the damage builds.  For instance I run a 190 haste set right now and every week I do the same dps as the other two shadow priests in my guild who use pure damage builds provided we have similar groups.  <br>
<br>
In 2.4 if you are cutting edge which is what most of this haste talk has been geared towards you don't have that choice, if you want the max SP you can get you will have 200 haste at least.  The question is do you want to go with 1400 sp and 400 haste or 1500 sp and 200 haste or whatever the actual numbers turn out to be.  You can try to come up with perfect cycles for whatever you plan on using but as you've put even if there is a perfect cycle you won't be able to maintain it because of lag and resists.  The simulations that I've done take both of these into account.  DPS cycles are picked on an absolute 'which spell is best next' cycle with certain spells like VT set as a priority because of raid benifits.  What it means is that if you are good enough at choosing your next spell you will get the results I'm showing. Maybe if you pick a better cycle you can even get better.  <br>
<br>
On mobile fights as Kalman says haste means you can get in more dps in the times you have to stand still.  To support this I'll give you the examples of Void Reaver and Azgalor.  On both fights I can perform exactly as good, and often better than pure damage builds, because my dots are ticking for perhaps 20 less and I'm getting in 2-3 more MF ticks in between having to move or in between silences.  <br>
<br>
Whether people like it or not haste is the wave of the future, you either except that and move on to how can I make it work best for me or you crash and burn like a hunter who still tries to fit aimshot into his rotation.  If you can learn to think on the fly and and at very least pick the next best spell every time to maximize dps you can get the results I've posted earlier, if you can only do the simple cycle then you need to figure out which haste value will give you the highest values.  If you choose the latter I'll give you a hint, shoot for 90 or 300 if possible and avoid 110 and 330.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Over the weekend I got my shadow dmg to 1024base and 72hit rating.<br>
<br>
the +8 to hit gems are hit rating and not spell crit. (except for the meta gem in the head piece)<br>
<br>
Ye I know my mana pool means "nothing" however i'm runnin out a lot faster now with less than 9k Base.<br>
<br>
I did a heroic shadow labs last night and saw (I think) a pretty decent improvement on my dps, but when we got to murmur i'm going to guess pretty confidently that i'd have run out of mana before the end of the fight. (I didn't find out because the mage wouldn't GTF away when he had murmurs touch)<br>
<br>
Draenic wisdom pots help out (alongside of Arc Brilliance) though.<br>
<br>
<br>
If you want - recheck me out on the armory.<br>
<br>
I still can't think why that trinket "eye" makes me get more hit rating to it, when it mentions nothing of the sort.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>What the above poster said, but I will comment on two points.<br>
<br>
First, you need 0 spell hit (if you have 3 points in shadow focus) to reach the hit cap in heroic Shadow Lab.  The highest mob there is level 72, which is a 6% base resist rate, if I recall correctly.  You can eliminate 5% of that.  So if you think gaining extra spell hit from your gems is helping in heroic Slab...you're wrong.<br>
<br>
Second, assuming all other factors remain constant, you will lose mana at the same RATE whether you have 5k mana or 10k mana.  If you trade spell damage for mana pool, you will lose mana at a LOWER rate.  Hence, I do not see how it is possible that you could run out of mana "a lot faster" if your gear is apparently improving.<br>
<br>
Edit: I know I promised to release an updated version of the main post like a week ago, been busy getting ready for a trip.   Expect another week or two of delay as a result.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">The casting cycle does *not* become more complex.  In fact, it arguably becomes easier to adhere to; I know one of my biggest problems is having the GCD not *quite* expired when my spell goes off, if I don't catch it, where I'll lose a half second to thinking I'm casting when in reality I was still under GCD.  In 2.4, this issue basically goes away.  The decisions are *not* hard, being essentially a chain of yes/no questions (VT up with &gt;1.5?  MB on CD?  SWD on CD?  SWP up?  VT up with &gt;2.5?  MB off CD in next ~second?  SWD off CD in next ~second?  SWP out in next ~second?  OK, mindflay - potentially clip flay, which means rerun that chain after 1 GCD).  If you can't do this chain in your head, you're not a good shadow priest no matter how little haste you have.  Haste does not change or complicate the chain; it changes the order of answers, but the chain remains accurate.</div>

</div>Lol at you for suggesting that these decisions are not hard.<br>
<br>
Deciding whether to cast spells based on which have finished cooldowns is relatively easy.<br>
<br>
Deciding whether, rather than casting MF, it is better to delay casting while MB finishes cooldown is not easy.<br>
<br>
This decision depends on:<br>
- exactly how long until MB/SWD finishes cooldown or VT/SWP wears off<br>
- how accurately you can cut MF off after 2 seconds (assuming you cut off)<br>
- how much risk you are prepared to take when cutting of MF (the risk being that you cut off the second tick).<br>
- which of your trinkets and procs are currently active<br>
- what spells will be available following the MB as this may impact your future casting choices<br>
- whether you are likely to need to move in the near future<br>
- how much +damage, haste and crit you have at this exact moment<br>

</div>I'm reasonably sure that I can, in fact, make these decisions to an accuracy good enough for government work.  A computer could almost certainly eke out 0.01 more DPS than me.  Maybe even 4 more DPS.  But a human can *easily* come close enough, because 99% of what you just mentioned is below the noise floor.<br>
<br>
What's more, I find your assertion that haste makes them hard when haste cuts at most a third of a second off the decision making time particularly hilarious - they're either hard without haste and with haste, or easy without and with.  Under no circumstance are they one way with one and the other with the other.  If you can't do the math in 1.2 seconds, you can't do it in 1.5 seconds either.<br>
<br>
The TLDR version:<br>
<br>
a) Not hard.<br>
b) Haste doesn't make it any harder.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

WIth the change to starshards I am using it into my Spell rotation. I want to know if anyone has a good spot for it, I actually open up with it b/c its arcane and because its free. <br>
<br>
I also open up with shdword:pain(rank 1) spamming it to get the vulnerabilities up to at-least 4-5 while the tank grabs aggro. My mana regen is enough and the absolute low cost of this spell makes the rest of my casting start more mana efficient then the rest. Now I actually have not done any numbers on this but I wanted to know if anyone/everyone did the same.<br>
so it goes:<br>
<br>
Starshards<br>
Rank 1(shadow word pain) 4-5 times to get vulnerabilities<br>
VT<br>
SWP(last rank)<br>
MB<br>
SWD<br>
MF<br>
MF<br>
MB<br>
then then my rotation begins.<br>

Using rank 1 SW:P depends on your guild and tank. If your raid leader is likely to drive to where ever you live and shove all 4 feet of his legs up your ass for pulling aggro, maybe casting rank 1 is a good idea. Personally, I use it on some bosses where a nasty avoidance string can lead to big trouble and dps isnt a big deal. However, as far as theory crafting goes, assume not to use it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
WIth the change to starshards I am using it into my Spell rotation. I want to know if anyone has a good spot for it, I actually open up with it b/c its arcane and because its free. <br>
<br>
I also open up with shdword:pain(rank 1) spamming it to get the vulnerabilities up to at-least 4-5 while the tank grabs aggro. My mana regen is enough and the absolute low cost of this spell makes the rest of my casting start more mana efficient then the rest. Now I actually have not done any numbers on this but I wanted to know if anyone/everyone did the same.<br>
so it goes:<br>
<br>
Starshards<br>
Rank 1(shadow word pain) 4-5 times to get vulnerabilities<br>
VT<br>
SWP(last rank)<br>
MB<br>
SWD<br>
MF<br>

</div>I'm not sure if you searched the thread or not, but the rule of thumb I remember reading more than once was that Starshards placed just above Mind Flay in the general priority of spells. It's free, but it also doesn't gain anything from your +Shadow damage gear, nor does it contribute to your VT or VE, nor does it benefit from Shadow Weaving.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_683638"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hello there,<br>
<br>
First off, thanks for the site - I'm very glad to have been referred here, so much info!   I've read the forum rules, and will try to keep my posts to the point and backed up with facts and research.<br>
<br>
I have a few questions regarding a build I am working on.  In a nutshell, I'm out of raiding T5 and T6 content due to some computer issues and guild progression was was very successful during my time out.  This build is being crafted with the goal of packing a punch and being able to effectively keep up when rejoining the raiding roster (I do have several items from SSC and TK).<br>
<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080327221852/http://cenarioncircle-us.warcrafter.net/Tashor" target="_blank">My current build</a><br>
<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080327221852/http://www.warcrafter.net/sandbox/35401" target="_blank">My working build</a><br>
<br>
Essentially, the new gear and talent build provides:<br>
<br>
a) 203 +spell hit rating <i>through gear and gems only.</i><br>
<br>
b) Remove(ing) points from Shadow Focus and funneling them into Shadow Power, in a hope of increasing my overall dmg output and mitigating the damage reduction subbing gems would cause.  I only replaced three rubies with veiled noble topaz's, two of which granted socket bonuses of a total of 7 dmg.<br>
<br>
c) 1130 shadow dmg unbuffed.<br>
<br>
d) 8095 health, 8561 mana.  Yes, yes, my mana pool means nothing. <br>
<br>
e) T4 +2 Setbonus - suped up shadow fiend.<br>
<br>
I am curious if I am shooting myself in the foot by providing my spell hit through my gear, as several items have been downgraded in order to obtain the spell hit, which can be shown by comparing my current gear with the current working build (which is two items from completion).  The overall downgrading, in my eyes, seems minute, but I would appreciate another pair of eyes and any references to increase my overall understanding of the mechanics.<br>
<br>
As Balkoth posted: "However, never itemise for spell hit unless you need 4-6 spell hit rating to drop another point in shadow focus and have an item that gives a +damage bonus with a yellow socket.".<br>
<br>
I assume this is just in reference that more spellpower is desirable than the +hit, specifically if you have the points in Shadow Focus.  Am I wrong here, or have I done an alright job in balancing the spellpower and being able to move those points?<br>
<br>
Another question would be the use of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080327221852/http://www.warcrafter.net/" target="_blank">Warcrafter</a> service - is it unreliable?  As an example, in comparing my working build to that of a raiding priest who has 1223 shadow spellpower and gear from ZA and T5 instances, the site calculates my build as having a higher "gear score".  If this is unreliable, is there a better site to use?  (I am new to these build sites, but Theorycraft just sprang into my mind - I've yet to use the service, so I will check it out).<br>
<br>
Thank you very much for your time.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_683677"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Warcrafter's gear score is simply a measure of ilevel and slotmod.  It has no relation to anything useful at all.<br>
<br>
Generally speaking, you're shooting yourself in the foot by gearing for hit.  For every 2% hit you gain from gear, you're effectively gaining 3% crit.  That's 66 crit rating for 25.24 hit rating.<br>
<br>
Now, 25.24 hit rating ~= 30 +dmg in terms of itemization cost (it's more complicated than that, because of the way itemization works, but it serves to illustrate the point).<br>
<br>
66 crit rating ~= 11 +dmg in the best case.<br>
<br>
You're screwing yourself pretty good by *intentionally* dropping hit rating.  Now, looking at armory of what you're actually wearing (146 hit rating):<br>
<br>
<b>Put your goddamn FSW back on.  Right now.  RIGHT NOW.  RIGHT THIS SECOND.  Every single piece of it.</b>  And if you haven't made it, make it.  It beats the hell out of what you're wearing - you'll notice that most T6 spriests are still wearing FSW boots.  There's a reason, and it isn't because we don't want to spend DKP.  That drops you down to 110.  That's enough to go 4/5 in Focus safely.  You could lose another 8, presumably from gems, without worry.  The meta you're using requires &gt;=2 yellows... I'm not a huge fan of that meta, honestly, but metas are expensive to replace.  Ideally, pick up a Hood of Hexing and socket it RRR for the time being; that would get 4 back, and then another 4 from socketing your wrist R, dropping you to the ideal 4/5 number of 102, while picking up significant spellpower.<br>
<br>
If you really want Shadow Power points, drop Silence and Imp Scream.  That's 3 points right there.  You could take the other 1 or 2 points out from Imp VE, if you're willing to give up a little health regen to improve group mana regen/personal DPS.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>4/5 T5 is really marginal from all the math I've seen.  If you're going H/Sh/Ch/Gl, the set bonus is a win over other accessible gear on H/Sh/Ch and a massive loss on Gl, as follows (first number is for RCS throughout, second assumes RLR, both assume 4 piece - if you don't have 4 piece, each T5 piece loses ~7 +dmg, making every single piece a net loss):<br>
<br>
H vs. (Hood of Hexing) = ~6 (15) damage loss.<br>
Sh vs (FSW) = ~4 (4) damage loss.<br>
Ch vs (FSW) = ~4 (2) damage loss.<br>
Gl vs (Studious) = -17 (-11) damage loss.<br>
<br>
I didn't analyze legs, because T5 legs are *awful*.  The end result is: there are three okay pieces, if you're wearing 4, but the 4th piece is so bad in comparison to the alternatives that the set as a whole isn't worth it.<br>
<br>
So, if you're using BT-level gems, 4T5 is a net loss (~3 dmg) vs. reasonable alternatives.  If you aren't, it's a small gain (~10 +dmg) at the cost of needing to pick up 4 pieces of raid gear before you see that gain.  In 2.4, it'll be less of a gain since the meta advantage HT5 has over HoHex is lowered since metas get worse for us.<br>
<br>
I never saw a good reason to go for 4T5.  I still don't.  T5 hat/shoulders is still a good combo, but leave chest/gloves for other people.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_684409"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->There may be some situations where it could prevent you getting aggro from dots ticking on resets, however for me at least, these situations are few and far between. On Leotheras we always used searing totems, which held him in place nicely for the tank most of the time. On Supremus, if the tanks didn't get in range before the switch am I buggered either way. Phase switches on Illidan seem very stable for us no matter what, though we are quite cautious with him as have only killed him 3 times so far.<br>
<br>
Even if it is ever useful, there is very little point in speccing to reducing the cooldown, at the expense of other options.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
The actual spell fade is incredible for a healer, but more situational for a DPSer (due to the limited amount of threat reduced - healers generate less threat and usually have aggro issues only at the beginning of encounters when little aggro has been generated). I have found it useful on Hydross, and it has saved me once on Illidan when he did his "I'm going to ignore the MD" routine coming out of demon phase (he ran up to me, I faded, he went back to the tank). I've also occasionally used it on trash pulls, particularly adding trash pulls (the shadowpriest often gets aggro on the new arrivals due to global threat from VE/VT, and fade will overcome that aggro - of course, this often gets someone else killed).<br>
<br>
Definitely not a great spell for a shadowpriest, but worth a spot in some corner of your bar I would say.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_684788"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Not sure why you're all wailing on fade. Obviously, improved fade is a useless talent for practically all situations, but the spell itself is great for a shadow priest. Assuming the fade threat reduction isn't reduced by salvation and such (doesn't make sense to me that it would), it gives the tank several ticks (5 seconds, atleast) worth of dots to gain aggro on the mob - more than enough for anybody who has tanked longer than a day.<br>
<br>
1500 aggro reduction is worth something like 2200 - 2300 damage with salvation, so should you hit the mob in question with a mind blast right after the phase change it still won't go for you even if the tank is asleep. Not to mention it's great for all situations involving adds and vampiric embrace. Illhoof, Morogrim, Zul'Aman, nearly all trash - the list goes on.<br>
<br>
It's not something I cast every single phase change or every encounter with adds, but if I ever feel I'm in a situation where I'm in danger of pulling for whatever reason, I'll use it. Some times it's great for avoiding add aggro, others its good for simply correcting your own mistakes.<br>
<br>
Casting it every cooldown is of course a totally insane waste of mana and dps time, but calling it something to never cast - that's just as crazy.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>It is extremely usful on fights such as Leothras (and Sartura in wow classic) but in most fights, its little beyond a hope and a prayer. Illidan I would argue is the same, as the amount of damage a SP will be dealing against illidan will quickly outstrip the threat from fade in just a few dot ticks. However, as a warlock told me in wow classic (thus, before soul shatter): <br>
<i>"You should always cast fade! If a priest pulls aggro, he casts fade and maybe he'll get away just fine. You know what a warlock does when he gets aggro? He goes and gets something to drink, cause hes already fucking dead!"</i><br>
<br>
Its a good quote cause it basically illustrates what fade is: better than nothing.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yes, Yes, and Mostly.  There are amounts of haste that make stacking additional points better than average and other amounts where the gain is less than average.  This is in contrast to spell damage, which always has the same returns per point.  But the value of haste never drops so much that you want to stop stacking it.  For all practical purposes, 1 haste = 1 damage.<br>
<br>
I'd also add:<br>
<br>
<b>4) Switch from Mystical Skyfire Diamond to Ember Skyfire Diamond once you have two pieces of gear with a lot of yellow slots.

</div>MSD gets nerfed next patch, and the current estimates have it in the 20 to 24 spell damage range.  The question is whether you can make up the 6 to 10 spell damage in socket bonuses.  It turns out you can with enough pieces of Sunwell gear.  That said, it's certainly not worth destroying your spinels in current gear to socket pyrestones, but you should consider using pyrestones instead on spinels on some of the newer pieces of gear.  Even my guild has been farming T6 for a while, and we still don't have enough spinels for everyone.<br>
<br>
Anyway, if you read the discussion a few pages back, you'll see the math on MSD versis ESD.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
As for the ESD vs MSD, this was dicussed 2 pages back. Quick conclusion was, the extra haste/dmg you gain from being able to match socket bonuses balances out the difference between the metas. It may not be worth regemming old gear, given the cost involved, and also the socket colours are not as enticing as sunwell gear. <br>

</div>Make sure the dot has fallen off first, otherwise you're doing what's called "clipping" your dots.  If you reapply a DoT just before it's about to fall off, you miss that last tick of the DoT, it gets overwritten by the new ones.  For example, for SWP:<br>
<br>
0.0 sec:  You cast SWP  (lets assume a 8 tick SWP, for 24 seconds)<br>
3.0 sec:  tick 1<br>
6.0 sec:  tick 2<br>
9.0 sec:  tick 3<br>
12.0 sec:  tick 4<br>
15.0 sec:  tick 5<br>
18.0 sec:  tick 6<br>
21.0 sec:  tick 7<br>
23.5 sec:  You reapply SWP before it falls off<br>
26.5 sec:  tick 1<br>
<br>
So you've missed tick 8, and you have a 5.5 second gap inbetween ticks.  As you can see that's definitely lower DPS.  The same thing applies to VT of course, except for VT it means you want to start casting it about 1 second before it is about to expire, since it has a 1.5 second cast time.<br>
<br>
As for the poster who followed, prioritizing MB/SWD over dots will lead to higher DPS.  Losing a tick of SWP is perfectly fine if you're filling that in with a MB/SWD combo.  That's far more damage.  I stick to VT having the highest priority still though.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Tedv, Bungle: Ah, I mistakenly thought you guys were talking about re-gemming existing T6 pieces with haste gems. I had also forgotten about the 2.4 MSD nerf.<br>
<br>
I gave the part of the thread you guys mentioned a quick reread. The main issue that I see with gemming my shiny new Sunwell items with haste gems is that I will immediately have too many yellow gems to allow continued use of my MSD. I'll have the take the hit on the inferior meta before I realize the benefit of the +spell damage socket bonuses, but at least I'll be building towards a stronger setup in the long run.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Just a minor nitpick, but I remember some math saying that delaying one pain tick was worse than delaying your shadow word death cooldown, so you still want to cast pain before death (assuming you'll get at least 3 pain ticks before the target dies).  I could be wrong.  That said, I generally use one of these three priority queues:<br>
<br>
<b>Unlimited Mana</b> (eg. Teron, Akama): Blast &gt; Touch &gt; Pain &gt; Death &gt; Plague &gt; Flay<br>
<b>Moderate Mana</b> (eg. Kaz'rogal, Illidan): Touch &gt; Blast &gt; Pain &gt; Death &gt; Plague &gt; Flay<br>
<b>Limited Mana</b> (eg. Shahraz, Council): Touch &gt; Pain &gt; Death &gt; Blast &gt; Plague &gt; Flay<br>
<br>
Embrace is refreshed whenever I have 1.5 seconds before a high priority spell should be cast but nothing useful to cast in the meantime.  Sometimes I'll trim blast and/or death from the limited mana cycle or even downrank mind flay and shadow word: pain if something goes very wrong.  Generally this involves having my shadow fiend get ganked and previously using a potion cooldown on a healing potion.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_686153"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I played a lock for a while, this is my first shadow priest. I am hoping for some advice on my currently attack pattern<br>
<br>
1. VE: (i do this first to give me the mana regen back from my other attacks)<br>
1.5. VT<br>
2. SWP: (im a lock, i get all my dots up and keep em up)<br>
3. MB: (get it out there so i can wait for the cooldown)<br>
4. MF<br>
5. MF (i find i can do 2 MF before the MB cooldown is up)<br>
6. MB<br>
7. VE (its usually up by then)<br>
<br>
After that its just keeping dots applied and using MB every time i can, also keeping MF up.<br>
<br>
Now here is one of my biggest questions, should i incorporate Shadow word Death, I haven't till this point because i hate putting extra healing on the healer, but the more i think of it i could most likely gain that health back with VT, so should i toss it in to up my dps.<br>

Any suggestions would rock, Oh lol another question [How much +to spell damage do you need to have to gain more mana back from mind flay then you put out?]<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic"><u>7. What is a spell priority system, and how does it apply to Shadow Priests?</u><br>
ZOMG I JUST NEED TO KNOW WHAT ROTATION TO USE.<br>
<br>
Sorry, it doesn't quite work like that.  Shadow priests may have specific combinations they like to cast (such as MB -&gt; MF -&gt; MF -&gt; MB) but they are part of a general priority system.  This priority system is a way to determine what spell to cast next.  It is a method to juggle essentially four cooldowns (MB, SW:D, VT, SW:P).<br>
<br>
The spell priority that is generally accepted is...<br>
<br>
1. VT<br>
2. SW:P<br>
3. MB<br>
<b>4. SW:D</b><br>
5. MF<br>
<br>
This means you always maintain VT, and then always maintain SW:P.  If both of these are ticking, use MB if it's up, and then SW:D.  Only MF if all four other spells are on cooldowns.<br>
<br>
NOTE: This is a maximum DPS priority list.  At lower gear levels, it is common to simply use...<br>
<br>
1. VT<br>
2. SW:P<br>
3. MF</div>

	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Also, the math you're asking about is extremely elementary. 5% of what amount is equal to [Mana Cost of Mind Flay]? With the base cost being 230 at max rank, (and 209 talented), you're going to have to make your Mind Flay hit for about 4180 in total to get 209 mana back. Impossible?<br>
<br>

		<div id="post_message_686565"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'm just putting this out there because i noticed a difference and wondered if someone could test it to make sure its doesnt just work for myself. Everyone on this forum swears up and down about SW and spell priorites are the way to go, and I am not saying you are wrong at all, i respect most of you alot. I just noticed a difference in my own overall damage and wanted to know if anyone else has. I do not use SW at all, when in a boss fight, but do use it on trash just for burst when the mob is about to go down. My spell rotation is :<br>
<br>
<br>
SW:P<br>
VT<br>
MB<br>
MFx2<br>
MB<br>
MFx2<br>
<br>
I dont use VE at all because this rotation causes high enough threat as it is. Generally in a boss fight, i alter it according to the fight. Obviously with imp SW:P you wont have to reapply it at the beginning of every rotation, and sometimes will have to cut MF 1 tick off in order to keep VT up. I used the spell priority provided in these posts, and when a buddy of mine hooked me up with this rotation, i noticed a big difference in my dps. I am at the top most of the time, surpassing the combat rogues, and BM hunters alot, whereas when I used SW in my "Priority list" i normally placed about 7th-10th. My own theory as to why it increased is because I am not wawiting on the GCD of SW, added up over a whole boss fight, is a lot of time. And before you immediately start typing and calling me an idiot, all I ask is that you try it before you bash it, just to see if your dps changes. I would greatly appreciate the help. And if your wondering, there are no other shadow priests in my guild that can test this for me, but i do have a couple others in different guilds testing my methods. Have a good one guys, and happy hunting.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
SW is more DPS than mind flay. The math is extremely simple - mind flay does not do twice as much damage as a single SW, therefore casting mind flay instead of SW will always be a DPS loss. Your anecdotal evidence is irrelevant and probably due to you having a shaman in your group, or having less death and decays targetted on you that run, or whatever. The only time that dropping SW will gain you DPS is a) if you're running out of mana or b) if SW is getting you killed (both very reasonable reasons for not casting the spell).<br>
<br>
There is no spell rotation because the cooldowns and DoT durations do not line up. Roughly, you just cast the highest damage per cast time spell each GCD (excepting that it has been shown to be worth it to cast mind blast before SW:P when both come up at once). Your DPS with a rotation may be higher if you're not very good at making spell choices (i.e., if you're messing up the priority queue), but that's human error. The math is, once again, simple - casting a lower DPS spell (like mind flay) when you could be casting a higher DPS spell (SW, mind blast) is going to be a DPS loss.<br>
<br>
Kayerra:<br>
<br>
Spell crit is a mediocre stat for classes who cast nothing but nukes that crit at 200% damage. Shadowpriests have only two spells that can crit, both of which are on cooldowns and thus can't be chain-casted, and both of which crit at only 150% damage. That's the basic logic behind it's near-uselessness for us - it's balanced around classes who can get far far greater benefit from it than we do.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I'm just putting this out there because i noticed a difference and wondered if someone could test it to make sure its doesnt just work for myself. Everyone on this forum swears up and down about SW and spell priorites are the way to go, and I am not saying you are wrong at all, i respect most of you alot. I just noticed a difference in my own overall damage and wanted to know if anyone else has. I do not use SW at all, when in a boss fight, but do use it on trash just for burst when the mob is about to go down. My spell rotation is :<br>
<br>
<br>
SW:P<br>
VT<br>
MB<br>
MFx2<br>
MB<br>
MFx2<br>
<br>
I dont use VE at all because this rotation causes high enough threat as it is. Generally in a boss fight, i alter it according to the fight. Obviously with imp SW:P you wont have to reapply it at the beginning of every rotation, and sometimes will have to cut MF 1 tick off in order to keep VT up. I used the spell priority provided in these posts, and when a buddy of mine hooked me up with this rotation, i noticed a big difference in my dps. I am at the top most of the time, surpassing the combat rogues, and BM hunters alot, whereas when I used SW in my "Priority list" i normally placed about 7th-10th. My own theory as to why it increased is because I am not wawiting on the GCD of SW, added up over a whole boss fight, is a lot of time. And before you immediately start typing and calling me an idiot, all I ask is that you try it before you bash it, just to see if your dps changes. I would greatly appreciate the help. And if your wondering, there are no other shadow priests in my guild that can test this for me, but i do have a couple others in different guilds testing my methods. Have a good one guys, and happy hunting.</div>

</div>hmm I use VT, SW:P,MB, SW,MFx2,MB,MFx2 repeat... only time I modify this is Depending on Boss fight encounter, or if its trash from what I have learned shadow priests increase damage wise with dration namely Because of dots ticking on a target you wont see as much dps as a straight out nuker on trash if its going down fast.<br>
<br>
Why do I cast VT first? your not counted as going into combat on your DPS meters till your dot lands... so why wouldnt you do longest cast time not to mention you have a 3 second window before your dot ticks ( give or take the 3 seconds its been a bit since I timed this).  So if you cast it first then SW:P.  I dont know what fights or trash your talking about specifically I have cleared hjal and bt to date and there are some fights where its imo not a shadow priest fight.<br>
<br>
Also take into acct that hjal there is alot of AOE based dps specifically on the trash I have found a way to kind of counter that with a good DOT rotation on thos mobs.... on specific fights I do very well others of course im going to loose dps because of threat ect... <br>
<br>
As far as your comment to VT causing threat VT causes 1 threat to every 2 points of mana you return to your group if you watch your meters accordingly THEN it should never be an issue of pulling off the tank due to threat.  VE is as applies for every 1 point of healing healed in your group you take 1 point of threat making VE not a good choice to cast on ALOT if not most of the content how ever on fights like BB (Blood Boil) I was requested to run VE as well as VT... BB is a very agro sensitive fight in phase 1 and I never pulled with proper spell rotation.<br>
<br>
As far as your dps being lost... I'm not quite sure how your loosing dps with the rotation I just gave you since I started using this last year I have seen substantial increases dps wise to the point on some fights I.E. illidan I was number 2 dps... Kael number 1... and vashj number 1 given nothing bad happened during the fights.  Do remember dps changes from SSC/TK to BT/Hjal... in the sense that there is (hjal) alot more aoe damage taking place as well as not being able to use SW... I would recommend you using that in regular rotation when you can UNLESS your very low on spell damage then I could see the reasoning for your rotation in that sense...<br>
<br>
Either way everyone has a rotation that works best for them that they have intigrated into the content they are currently on... I hope maybe me telling you what I have done might shed some light on WHY people use VT first.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_686705"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->It is not a huge deal for several reasons.<br>
<br>
As a shadow priest, you have two spells that can crit.  Neither spell is spammable, both are on significant cooldowns.  Furthermore, you only gain 50% extra damage on a crit, there are no modifiers for 100% damage bonus like some other spell casting classes have (warlock talent 'Ruin' for example).<br>
<br>
As you can see, you don't get much 'bang for your buck' from crit rating.<br>
<br>
That's not to say it wont increase your DPS, as it will.  It just isn't as effective to stack as spell damage is (which increases the damage of *everything* you do.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

When I changed my spec to include spell crit I saw a substantial increase not HUGE no but enough that I would want to keep it.  I guess that was what I was getting at is that even tho its periodic STILL when I do crit it boosts my dps AND mana for my group.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

1.4s GCD and latency allows VT be cast<br>

3s   swp first tick gives mana back.<br>

VT/SWP would start give a mana return after 1.4+3 seconds, right? <br>
Which then gives mana for both swp and vt at the same time (minus latency).<br>

</div>With sufficient haste to avoid missing the tick of regen, SW:P -&gt; VT is higher DPS than VT -&gt; SW:P.  When both need to be refreshed at the same time (such as at the beginning of a fight), regardless of the order chosen, the second one's damage is delayed by 1.5 seconds (or less with haste).  VT ticks are smaller than SW:P ticks, and as a result delaying the VT tick reduces damage less.  However, this doesn't necessarily mean that casting SW:P is correct.  If this choice comes up once every two minutes (with perfect play, it should happen exactly once if you never delay SW:P for MB/SW), you're gaining (SW:P Tick size - VT Tick size)/120 DPS -- i.e. under 1 DPS at the cost of increasing the chance of not having VT up if you make a mistake.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>It's still 4 seconds and provides 320 haste rating (roughly 19%).  It's rare that more than 2 spells will get hasted, so you pretty much always get one base 1.5 second cast and one mind flay, meaning the haste affects 4.5 seconds of base cast time per proc.  At 320 haste for 4.5 seconds once every minute, this is roughly equivalent to 24 passive haste.  It's significantly worse than than the 2.3 version, which worked out to roughly 40 spell damage.<br>

I would add <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30038" target="_blank">[Belt of Blasting]</a> to the pre-raid gear list. There are probably such new<br>

		<div id="post_message_688707"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Having spent more time with the new Mystical Skyfire Diamond, I think it's actually a bit worse than the initial estimate of 24 spell damage.  To really analyze the gem, you need to take into account the typical breakdown of each kind of spell cast (3 second, 1.5 second, and instant).  To be really precise, you need to know for each kind, the chance of each kind of cast following it, but I won't go that in depth now.  To wit:<br>
<br>
A rough estimation says here is your typical breakdown with 0 spell haste:<br>
<br>
In 60 seconds, a nearly flawless rotation will cast:<br>
<br>
4 Vampiric Touch (6s)<br>
8 Mind Blasts (12s)<br>
4 Shadow Word Death (6s)<br>
2 Shadow Word Pain (3s)<br>
1 Vampiric Embrace (1.5s)<br>
10 Mind Flay (30s)<br>
<br>
Which leaves half a second for lag.  A bit aggressive but good enough for the modeling.  Now the breakdown per cast duration is around:<br>
<br>
3.0 second cast (gives 1.0 seconds on proc): 50%<br>
0.0 second cast (gives 2.5 seconds on proc): 30%<br>
1.5 second cast (gives 4.0 seconds on proc): 20%<br>
<br>
Making the assumption that each cast type has a 50/30/20 chance of following any type of cast (not necessarily true, but good enough for estimation), we assume there is a 50% chance a followup cast will take 3 seconds and a 50% chance it takes 1.5 seconds (either from cast time or GCD).  We can break down the actual amount of hastable time as follows:<br>
<br>
Proc after 3.0 cast: 50% chance 1 seconds<br>
- 3.0: 50% chance (3.0s)<br>
- 1.5: 50% chance (1.5s)<br>
Net benefit: (3 * .5 + 1.5 * .5) * .5 = 1.125 seconds of haste time<br>
<br>
Proc after 0.0 cast: 30% chance 2.5 seconds<br>
- 3.0: 50% chance (3.0s)<br>
- 1.5 then 3.0: 25% chance (4.5s)<br>
- 1.5 then 1.5: 25% chance (3.0s)<br>
Net benefit: (3 * .75 + 4.5 * .25) * .3 = 1.0125 seconds of haste time<br>
<br>
Proc after 1.5 cast: 20% chance 4 seconds<br>
- 3.0 then 3.0: 25% chance (6.0s)<br>
- 3.0 then 1.5: 25% chance (4.5s)<br>
- 1.5 then 3.0: 25% chance (4.5s)<br>
- 1.5 then 1.5 then 3.0: 12.5% chance (6.0s)<br>
- 1.5 then 1.5 then 1.5: 12.5% chance (4.5s)<br>
Net benefit: (6 * .375 + 4.5 * .625) * .2 = 1.0125 seconds of haste time<br>
<br>
Total benefit: 3.15 seconds hasted time per proc<br>
<br>
Now it's worth noting that if you get enough haste rating, you can squeeze even more casts in the 4 second buff window, getting a larger benefit.  You get a few benefits once you hit the 150 range, and more in the 350 I believe.  The problem is that as you get more haste, a greater percent of your casts are mind flays, which make you much more likely to get the 1.0 second buff.  Haste makes the best cases better, but the worse cases more frequent.  I could work out the exact chances at each level of haste, but I doubt we'd see much change, especially given the already established conclusion that Ember Skyfire Diamond is the choice for endgame gear.<br>
<br>
Anyway, at one proc per minute, MSD gives 3.15s / 60s of 320 haste.  This is 16.8 haste rating, or only 2.8 spell damage higher than Ember Skyfire.  I'll run some numbers at 150 haste (since that's how much I have) and see if the value goes up or down, but I'm not expecting much change.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

	</tbody></table>
</div>Rather than the old "We only have two spells that can crit" argument, look at things this way:<br>
<br>
We cast 5 spells, each of them makes up roughly 20% of our damage done. Sure this varies between about 15-25% and VT and SW: Death are almost always lower than MF, MB and SW: Pain, but it's a good working assumption considering the variance we get in damage done due to small sample sizes.<br>
<br>
Also, critting isn't gaining a whole spell damage's worth of damage the only thing you cain from a crit (average crit damage) - (average non crit damage)<br>
<br>
So, with a 10% crit rate:<br>
<br>
20% of your damage is from Mind Blasts, of that, 0.5*0.1*0.2 = 0.01 or 1% of your damage comes from crits.<br>
<br>
If you increase your crit rate to 20%, 0.5*0.2*0.2 = 2% of your damage will come from crits, a 1% gain from 10% more crit. <br>
<br>
<b>If you spent the same amount of your item budget on spell damage instead of crit, you would have a significantly higher increase in damage. This is why crit is "bad."</b><br>
<br>
I know this doesn't look right, you'll say "but MB will now be a larger % of my total damage done" but the number of casts stays the same, you only gain that fraction of damage gained over the base from a crit.<br>
<br>
But don't trust my word, look at real world data, here's a breakdown from a random WWS parse of someone I don't even know on Lurker where threat and raid damage shouldn't be a constraint: (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080331235342/http://wowwebstats.com/6kzytpzmeqpva?s=1843-2146&amp;a=14" target="_blank">Danô - WWS</a>)<br>
<br>
Damage done: 319,220 <br>
<br>
MB: 88 025 27% 19 hits averaging 2570, 10 crits averaging 3917 gain 1347 per crit, 34% crit rate.<br>
SW: Pain: 65 645 20%<br>
MF: 61 428 19%<br>
VT: 56 118 17%<br>
SW: Death: 39 990 12% 11 hits at 2060 5 crits at 3465, gain 1405 per crit, 30% crit rate<br>
Devouring Plague: 8 014 2%<br>
<br>
Bump this up to 45% crit rate:<br>
<br>
MB: 16 hits for 41120, 13 crits for 50921, 92041 total, a whole 4K more damage<br>
SW: Death:  9 hits for 18540, 7 crits for 24255, 42795 total, 3K more damage<br>
<br>
Total damage: 326041, 102% damage with a 10% crit rate increase.<br>
<br>
Again, the item value to increase your crit rate by anything meaningful would increase your DPS far more if it were spend on spelldamage instead.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_689825"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->With 10% spell haste (157 rating), Mind Flay casts in 2.72 seconds and all other spells take 1.36 seconds.  Here's what a typical minute of casting looks like:<br>
<br>
4 Vampiric Touch (5.44s)<br>
8 Mind Blasts (10.88s)<br>
4 Shadow Word Death (5.44s)<br>
2 Shadow Word Pain (2.72s)<br>
1 Vampiric Embrace (1.36s)<br>
12 Mind Flay (32.64s)<br>
<br>
That's 58.48 seconds total, with a cast time breakdown of:<br>
<br>
2.72 second cast: 56%<br>
0.00 second cast: 28%<br>
1.36 second cast: 16%<br>
<br>
With another 320 spell haste from the proc, the cast times drop to 2.30 for Mind Flay and 1.15 for all others.  Here's the probability breakdown for each case.  Sorry it's a lot of data and most of you won't read it, but it's there if you care.<br>
<br>
<b>Proc after 2.72 cast:</b> 56% chance 1.28 seconds<br>
- 2.3: 56% chance (2.72 of spell cast in 2.3 seconds = .42 seconds gained)<br>
- 1.15: 44% chance (1.36 of spell cast in 1.15 seconds = .21 seconds gained)<br>
<br>
Net time saved: (.42 * .56 + .21 * .44) * .56 = 0.183 seconds of additional cast time<br>
<br>
<b>Proc after 0.0 cast:</b> 28% chance 2.64 seconds<br>
- 2.3 then 2.3: 31.36% chance (5.42 seconds cast in 4.6 seconds = .82 seconds gained)<br>
- 2.3 then 1.15: 24.64% chance (4.08 seconds cast in 3.45 seconds = .53 seconds gained)<br>
- 1.15 then 2.3: 24.64% chance (4.08 seconds cast in 3.45 seconds = .53 seconds gained)<br>
- 1.15 then 1.15 then 2.3: 10.84% chance (5.42 seconds cast in 4.6 seconds = .82 seconds gained)<br>
- 1.15 then 1.15 then 1.15: 8.52% chance (4.08 seconds cast in 3.45 seconds = .53 seconds gained)<br>
<br>
Net time saved: (.82 * .422 + .53 * .578) * .28 = 0.183 seconds of additional cast time<br>
<br>
<b>Proc after 1.5 cast:</b> 16% chance 4 seconds<br>
- 2.3 then 2.3: 31.36% chance (5.42 seconds cast in 4.6 seconds = .82 seconds gained)<br>
- 2.3 then 1.15 then 2.3: 13.80% chance (6.78 seconds cast in 5.75 seconds = 1.03 seconds gained)<br>
- 2.3 then 1.15 then 1.15: 10.84% chance (5.42 seconds cast in 4.6 seconds = .82 seconds gained)<br>
- 1.15 then 2.3 then 2.3: 13.80% chance (6.78 seconds cast in 5.75 seconds = 1.03 seconds gained)<br>
- 1.15 then 2.3 then 1.15: 10.84% chance (5.42 seconds cast in 4.6 seconds = .82 seconds gained)<br>
- 1.15 then 1.15 then 2.3: 10.84% chance (5.42 seconds cast in 4.6 seconds = .82 seconds gained)<br>
- 1.15 then 1.15 then 1.15 then 2.3: 4.77% chance (6.78 seconds cast in 5.75 seconds = 1.03 seconds gained)<br>
- 1.15 then 1.15 then 1.15 then 1.15: 3.75% chance (5.42 seconds cast in 4.6 seconds = .82 seconds gained)<br>
<br>
Net benefit: (1.03 * .322 + .82 * .678) * .2 = 0.178 seconds of haste time<br>
<br>
That's a total of .544 seconds of cast time gained each proc, once per minute.  So this lets you cast 60.544 seconds of spells in 60 seconds, or equivalent affect of 0.9% spell haste.  That's the benefit you get from <b>14 spell haste rating</b>.<br>
<br>
In other words, as you gain more spell haste, Mystical Skyfire Diamond is even worse.  So right this very moment, Ember Skyfire Diamond is probably better than Mystical if you've been farming black temple for a while.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>For mana returns, (Mana gained from VT)/(damage done) 0.047-0.048 (4.7-4.8%) is good on static fights where you just stand there and wail on a boss. On fights where there are other things to do, 0.044-0.046 is about par. Under 0.04 is bad and needs improvement.<br>
<br>
For single target fights, take the (DPS time)/3 for the optimal number of ticks for both SW:Pain and VT, they should be very close to 100% on static fights, lower as movemet increases but I don't know of any single target other than Supremus where less than 80% is reasonable. SW: Pain should have a higher uptime than VT on movement or interrupted DPS fights since it is instant cast.<br>
<br>
(DPS time)/7.5 for 4/5 imp Mind Blast to determine the optimal number of Mind Blasts. If you're doing better than 60% you're doing OK. 5/5 would be DPS time/7, etc. It's casting time + cooldown for max number of casts.<br>
<br>
(DPS time)/12 for SW: Death. Should be a higher percentage than MB on fights where you can use it, 70-80%+ is good.<br>
<br>
That's for uptimes, it tells you if your shadow priests are actually casting constantly or not. Not casting 100% of the time is the biggest cause of low DPS.<br>
<br>
Other things to look for are: Is he using his on use trinkets? What kind of potions and how often is he using them? Is his shadow fiend regularly getting close to 10 hits in? Does he have high DPS time (as a dot class it should usually be among the highest)? Is he dying to things he shouldn't? Is he consistently getting a large number of resists?<br>
<br>
The absolute rock bottom minimum DPS is his average mind flay tick since the simplest thing is to stand and spam flay. If you can't do better DPS than that you're screwing up seriously.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				very good, but you forgot the 1% resist rate, however here is the maths for shadowpriests:<br>
<br>
1) Proc delay:<br>
1/ (tick/sec * proc rate) + internal CD = 1/ (1.33*0.1) + 15 = 22.5sec per proc (let's assume 4 ticks per 3 seconds (3 from Mindflay / 2 from dots, but you lose some depending on how heavy your MB / SW Rotation is)<br>
<br>
2.) Average Damage = 380 * 1.15 (shadowform)* 1.1 * 1.05 * 1.13 * (1+0.13*0.5) * (1+0.2*0.5) = 668,16 * 1% resist rate = 661,48<br>
<br>
3.) DPS = 661,48/22.5 = 29,40<br>
<br>
4.) Equivalent Damage for Shadowpriests 1 dmg = 0.5 dps, 29,40/0.5 + 44 = 102,8 damage, which makes it the best shadowpriest trinket at the moment.<br>
<br>
(note: this is a perfect raid environment)<br>
<br>
a few more comments:<br>
<br>
-ISB debuff does NOT get consumed by a proc<br>
-the proc works normally with VE/VT due do it being shadow based<br>
-Shadowform WORKS on the proc

				4ticks/3s is quite an optimistic rate of ticks, with a full mb/SW:D rotation you're looking at 1tick/1s.<br>
<br>
and spriest scaling in those perfect raid conditions is more like 0.58dps/dmg.<br>
<br>
Recalc with those and it's 89dps, best but only just above hex head.<br>

		<!-- message -->
		<div id="post_message_703642"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I recently ran these number.  When I was raid buffed with around 600 int and 353 spirit (including Divine Spirit and <a class="q2" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=18284" target="_blank">[Kreeg's Stout Beatdown]</a>), each point in meditation is worth 40 m/5.  With around 250 spirit and 600 int, each point is roughly 28 m/5.  These all assume chain casting scenarios, mind you.  So yes, it's a lot of mana.<br>
<br>
Regarding Inner Focus, if you are undead, you save 1145 mana every 3 minutes when you cast Devouring Plague.  That's a saving of 31.8 m/5, so undead should only drop Inner Focus when their buffed spirit gives them more m/5 than this (at around 270 spirit, 600 int).<br>
<br>
If you are not undead, your best options for saving mana is shadow word pain, 575 mana saved every 3 minutes, or 16 m/5, meaning you should always drop Inner Focus.  Of course you lose the option of casting Inner Focus on Mind Blast for extra crit.  Given an average non-crit mind blast damage of 2700, you lose 25% of 1350 damage every 3 minutes.  This is a 1.875 DPS loss, which is basically meaningless.<br>
<br>
Conclusion: Every non-undead shadow priest should drop Inner Focus unless they really have points to spare and need the mana.  Every well geared shadow priest that needs an extra talent point should cut Inner Focus before Meditation.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>You can work around some of this quite easily.  Cast VE on the pull, and let it drop off normally.  Coincidentally, it'll drop just as she's about to take off, so you can nuke without worrying about extra VE threat.   I haven't really run into threat issues since having to wait after Gas Nova cooldown for Mass Dispel can take a bite out of optimal DPS anyways.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Imp VE is great cept for that 66% increase in healing aggro.    The thought of respeccing mid raid suxs, but I think the Imp VE will okay for Kalecgos. Threat not being a problem in the Demon World but watched closely on the Dragon. I usually need to just stop dpsing if I get the +100 threat Wild Magic. (Well, a little anywayz   )</div>

</div>I am honestly thinking about trying the 11/0/50 spec next week.

I still think I want to keep 2/2 Imp VE, but I could see going with 1 point there as well.   I can see other people needing not to put any there if you're running into serious threat issues -- although that probably means your tank needs to step up the TPS.  For Felmyst as I stated above, please do make sure you're letting VE drop off naturally, there's no need to add in extra threat while she's airborne as you're blasting away at her.

</div>I'm in almost exactly the same situation (with the pants upgrade causing the same problems as well).  I thought about dropping more points from discipline, but I'm edgy about cutting more than 2 points from discipline.  What it really comes down to is how consistently you get a shaman and all three blessings.  11 points in discipline is simply not enough if you're missing mana stream and/or blessing of wisdom.  It's also worth noting that mass dispel on Felmyst is not cheap, although you shouldn't have to cast it THAT often.

</div>Felmyst is pretty easy from a mana perspective I think.  Basically I make sure to refresh dots about 3 seconds before the Gas Nova CD is up, then I just sit there with my Mass Dispel circle where it needs to be.  Half the time I'm getting some ticks outside of the 5SR.   In the air phase, I spend very little mana -- usually the skellies are dead as the 2nd breath has been laid down, and I don't really bother doing DPS to skellies anymore since our AOE is so strong.  <br>
<br>
I figure the worst case scenario is I lose something like 80 mp/5 with no Meditation.  Chugging mana pots on CD is greater than that, for sure.  <br>
<br>
Your points regarding blessings and shamans are good though and probably the deciding factor.  We have 3 paladins for most fights, so I can count on BoW, and they're very good on having JoW up.  I'm always with a shaman -- sometimes resto, sometimes elemental.  Leaving 1 in Meditation may not be so bad -- since that's the equivalent of 2/3 "old" Meditation which we had the majority of TBC.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Well your gear is really similar to mine, so you should be at around 600 int, 350 spirit raid buffed as well.  Each point in meditation is 40 m/5 if you are chain casting in this situation.  That's amazing, but obviously it's still bad to trade a little damage you do need for a lot of mana you don't need.

</div>Armory lists you at 224 spirit, 480 int with no buffs at all.<br>
<br>
Your buffed spirit will be 224 + 50 (Divine Spirit) + 20 (Food) + 25 (Stout Beatdown), plus 10%, or 351.<br>
Your buffed int will be 480 + 40 (Arcane Int) - 5 (Stout Beatdown), plus 10%, or 567.<br>
<br>
So with 567 int, 351 spirit, you regain 390 m/5 from spirit when not casting, which is 39 m/5 per point.  Obviously meditation gets a lot worse when you're not fully raid buffed, but that's only the case on non-progression content, so the talent being worse isn't a huge deal.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Mind Blast is 450 mana, and you can use it at most once in a 5 second period. That's 22.5 mp/5 (really it's less because of the cooldown but we'll use these numbers just to prove the point and I don't feel like calculating it ). We'll say you cast 2 more MF's in that 5 second period (ignoring the fact that the 2nd MF would run into the next 5 seconds). MF is 230 mana, so 460 total for 2, 23 mp/5 total. So best case scenario, a time where you cast MB + 2xMF, you'll be getting 45.5 mp/5. Now if you factor in the time spent refreshing VT, SWP, VE and using SWD, there is no way that Focused Mind ends up being more than 39 mp/5 you're getting from 1 point in Meditation.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>  I would say I am at a pretty similar gear level, and my DPS varies greatly.  On teron last night (I never went to a ghost so the numbers are right) I did 1100 DPS and was pretty happy with that, though that is a beautiful boss fight in that it is just constant nuke until Debuff (though I was getting a bit of construct with VE aggro so lost DPS from taking them out of the raid).  On early MH trash I can consistantly hit 13-1400 DPS by multi DoTTing, though this will easily take up 90%+ of my mana per wave.  But some stuff I am as low as 700 (any trash that dies too fast for DoTs to pay off specifically).  But for DPS boost DoT all tanked trash :-)/<br>
<br>
  Are you always consumabled up?  What number are they looking at? (bear in mind overall damage is utterly irrelevant, it is skewed by AoE etc etc. Only individual boss fight numbers should be used to determine performance.  Though some boss fights favour SP more than others.  Supremus I am usually near the top.  Archimonde I struggle to hit 700, whilst melee can be at 1400.....  <br>
<br>
  Put simply, what are they basing their statements on?  What is your DPS on bosses? On trash?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I am honestly thinking about trying the 11/0/50 spec next week.  The only fight I ever use a mana pot on still is Council, and that's simply due to all the resists/poor mana return when Gathios has that Magic Resistance aura up.  I've never have had to use a mana pot in Sunwell and I don't think I've even managed to dip below half mana on Brutallus.  Since I picked up <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=34386" target="_blank">[Pantaloons of Growing Strife]</a> (socketed with 2x Reckless Pyrestone and 1 Crimson Spinel) this week I have my Flays down to a 2.70 cast -- good enough to take advantage of 5/5 Imp MB.  However I've been losing +hit on my gear so I need to put more points back into Shadow Focus.  <br>
<br>
I still think I want to keep 2/2 Imp VE, but I could see going with 1 point there as well.   I can see other people needing not to put any there if you're running into serious threat issues -- although that probably means your tank needs to step up the TPS.  For Felmyst as I stated above, please do make sure you're letting VE drop off naturally, there's no need to add in extra threat while she's airborne as you're blasting away at her.  Healing at that point is much more relaxed since there's no Gas Nova/Encapsulate going on.</div>

</div>Tonight on Brut I had a resto shaman and BoW (no JoW I think) and I was able to go full throttle dps without running low on mana till about the 5 minute mark. I called for (and got) an innervate and was able to keep going but had to slam that last pot timer as a mana pot instead of a destro. I *really* hate asking for innervates but would like to be able to go all out without chain chugging mana pots (we need all the dps we can get). Our gear is pretty different, I still need my T6 chest and a helm upgrade, but I am at 2/3 meditation and am running low on mana, yet you're at 0/3 and having no issues? Is that really just a difference in gear and the presence of JoW?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

On Brutallus, going all out with an elemental shaman and no JoW I was hitting maybe 40% mana with Brutallus at 20%, then I'd pop shadowfiend and get back up to full mana.

If your options are Skull/Timbal/Hex, it's not clear at all.<br>
<br>
If your options don't include one of the other two, it's absolutely clear.<br>
<br>
*Given that* Skull is so close to Timbal's in terms of power, and given that it's only close for spriests, there's a very solid argument to be made re: not taking a Skull if you don't already have one unless your other DPS casters already have it.<br>
<br>
9 out of 10 fights, Timbal's seems to give ~20-22 DPS (no CoS/CoS being the bounds there).  I have some lower numbers, but you'll note: no ISB on those numbers (minus Rage, which is such a short fight that random chance will produce relatively large swings), and no CoS on *any* of my numbers.  We're looking at ~85-90 equivalent +dmg from the trinket in this case, which is solidly tied for best trinket with Hex and Skull (ignoring hit).  Hex is going to be stronger in short fights, due to the on-use nature and how it interacts with fights of (e.g.) 2.5 minute duration.  Timbal's is likely to be stronger in long fights and motion fights.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Skull is cemented for now, due to the huge +hit bonus. My choice is thus Hex or Timbal, and from most wws I've seen, 20-25 is a rare peak for timbal (and mind you 25/0.6 is 41.67, +44 from static dmg equals 85.67, still inferior choice to Hex), with the majority of fights proc being worth around 15 dps, which is really underwhelming.<br>
<br>
And what you mentioned about short fights, isn't exactly true. Any fight with a length which maximizes hex uptime will yield very very high results for hex (2 min avg, 2min20 high, 4 min avg, 4min20 high etc). And timbal...motion fights significantly lower its procrate, due to losing MF as a proc factor, so its value will drop there also. <br>
<br>
But still...a raid with a decent ISB uptime (hopefully next week it will be for us) will boost timbal a lot. I really want to see tons and tons of wwses from all kinds of fights about timbal though...lots and lots of data is the thing that will bring the truth, not all this talking and speculations based on 5 parses.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The +hit will be far more valuable to mages and locks, who are *also* looking at the gear from Sunwell and going "Hm... where's the hit?", and don't have 10% worth of talents available.  Again, I'm not arguing whether it's good for us - it is - but whether it's worth taking over one of those classes, given that they have the same hit issues and minimal/no hit talents.<br>
<br>
4:20 does better than 4, sure, but 4:20 is less good than 2:20 (40/140 &gt; 60/260, etc.), making the value of the trinket as fights go longer less and less distant from the average, hence my statement about it favoring shorter fights - the excess uptime from minimum (not average) is more valuable in a shorter fight since it applies across less time.<br>
<br>
By contrast, Timbal's doesn't get hurt anywhere near as much as you seem to think by the loss of MF ticks.  If you weren't flaying at all, you'd lose ~40% of your chances to proc the trinket over a stand and spam fight, going from ~1.1 tick/second to ~0.66 ticks/second.  Now, you can expect a proc roughly every 15 + z seconds, where z is determined as:<br>
<br>
1/ (tick/sec * proc rate) = z<br>
<br>
1/(1.1*.1) = 9.09<br>
1/(.66*.1) = 15.15<br>
<br>
So, 24 seconds vs. 30 seconds between procs expected, assuming a burn rotation (best case) vs. a SWP/VT only rotation (worst case).  In other words, if full burn is netting us 20 DPS, SWP/VT only would net us 16 DPS, a loss of 8 +dmg effective - significantly better than we could expect from a trinket giving us passive, or even activated average, damage in a circumstance where you're only getting dots up.<br>
<br>
20 is what I've seen on most of my WWS, without CoS.  I get rare drops into the 15-18 range, and rare boosts into the 24-25 range, but 20 is a quite reasonable base number.<br>
<br>
Your 0.6 number doesn't match up with nearly anything I've seen, by the way.  0.5 is the standard dmgPS conversion.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_709515"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Looking at 3 full raid days (a bit over 12hours) worth of Brutallus attempts the Timbal's proc came out to ~23dps average for me. I got this by taking the total shadow bolt damage divided by dps time which is conveniently displayed in seconds on wws. <br>
<br>
This was with maledictioned CoS, 2 destruction locks, 1 affliction and 1 shadow priest. ISB uptime 73% according to the simulator on the warlock spreadsheet site. Also of note were that I had 0%, 0.5% and 3.1% resist rate on it over these 3 raids. I was grouped with an elemental draenei shaman so was hitcapped without shadow focus so I think it's pretty safe to assume it uses you actual spellhit not counting shadow focus. So I guess the value will slightly drop as we get rid of hit for haste on the sunwell gear.<br>
<br>
0.6dps per damage is about what I get too if I use the spreadsheet and put in sunwell level gear and full raid buffs and debuffs. Even slightly more if I put in completely full sunwell gear which I think turned out to be 410 haste ~1700 dmg full raid buffed.<br>
<br>
Using these values I'd agree with the conclusion that Skull&gt;Hex&gt;Timbal's&gt;rest<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

It has always been around 0.65 to 0.6 in ded's simulations, which are the only real work I've seen to determine dps scaling. Where do you get 0.5 from?<br>
<br>
And the wws links I posted have 15-20ish dps of the proc WITH malediction CoS and 1 destro lock (so moderate ISB uptime), and still the proc is not impressive at all. 2-3 destro locks will hopefully raise it a bit.<br>
<br>
And about Hex - yes, the "excess" bonus uptime diminishes as the fight goes up, but in the limit (worst case scenario), it converges to the average value, not below. Let's see it:<br>
2 min - 1/6 - value of trinket is 88.17 pseudodmg<br>
2 min 20 - 2/7 - 113.28<br>
4 min - 1/6 - 88.17<br>
4 min 20 - 1/4 - 105.75<br>
...<br>
10 min - 1/6 - 88.17<br>
10 min 20 - 6/31 - 93.83<br>
...<br>
<br>
As you can see, even in a 500 min fight, worst case scenario the trinket is going to be worth 88.17 pseudodmg. In a typical fight, lot more. And timbal barely reaches the average of Hex.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_709693"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->If I was a raid leader discussing loot as we progressed to Illidan with an eye to doing Sunwell, I'd have to share Kalman's viewpoint.

Having said that, I'm very glad I have a Skull, because it's not easy finding points to put into Shadow Focus in Sunwell.  Haste and the right gear makes having 5/5 Improved Mind Blast a good idea.  Improved Vampiric Embrace is extremely useful for progression fights -- the name of the game is stability when you're learning a new boss, and usually the focus for stability is healing.   Kalecgos, Brutallus, Felmyst -- all 3 of those fights we can do non-trivial group healing that can actually be planned around, especially in the case of Brutallus.  In the standard 14/0/47 spec with both those talents maxed, that only leaves me with 2/5 in Shadow Focus.   <br>
<br>
In the abstract, I'd consider Skull/HSH the best combo, but from the math being postulated here, Timbal's is a worthy option.   One benefit to Timbal's is it's a passive trinket -- one less thing to watch for.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I would disagree that the potion effect is meaningless.  The Holy thread estimates the increased mana as somewhere between 24 and 50 mp5.  That translates into a lot of other gear slots that could be optimized for dps.  <br>

On the other hand, if there is already little to no weight on mp5, spirit, or meditation for one's gear choices, AND there are no mana problems, THEN, and only then, would I consider the mana boost to be of no additional value to dps.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Well, yes.  There's a line between "This is better for others" and "I have pushed the button adequately.  I would like my bacon, please."  You have to figure out for yourself where that line sits, for you and your guild.  Growing Strife are an excellent example of somewhere you simply shouldn't feel guilt - they're best in slot for you, and other DPS have a better option.  Unfettered Magics, as a counter-example, is something I'd feel absolutely secure in waiting on.<br>

		<div id="post_message_710377"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I've been thinking about the extreme amount of threat we're generating in Sunwell content due to the amount of healing Vampiric Embrace can and should do.  Threat is usually not an issue on Kalecgos due to split DPS and the magic of taunt, although before the first portal it can be an issue.  I've pulled aggro while standing in melee range of Brutallus (but not while at range), and I'm DPS capped on Felmyst even when Vampiric Embrace is only up for phase 1.  And while I haven't tried the twins yet, I know there's a reasonable amount of raid AoE damage there as well.<br>
<br>
What I'm considering is whether it's worth speccing points into Silent Resolve, since currently the talent reduces the threat of Vampiric Embrace (although Shadow Affinity does not).  It's hard to estimate the amount of real healing Vampiric Embrace will do because that's heavily based on the fight.  Looking at Brutallus parses, I healed for 45% of my damage (for each 100 damage dealt, I healed 45 health).  Kalecgos appeared to be around 85%, and while those numbers might not parse well, healing is only done when damage is done, so the percent should still be correct.  I don't have Felmyst parses, but I'd assume there's at least as much healing as Kalecgos since the incoming damage happens more frequently.  My estimate for Felmyst is 100%.  For the record, the theoretical maximum for no over-healing at all is 125%: 25% of your damage times 5 party members.<br>
<br>
For the purpose of this analysis, I'll just consider Shadow Affinity and Silent Resolve, since all other modifiers (salvation, tranquil air) apply equally to both threat sources.  The question is how much X points in Silent Resolve will increase your threat cap, assuming 1 damage averages H healing.<br>
<br>
Each point of damage will cause .75 threat from damage plus H * .5 * (1 - 0.04 * X) threat from healing.  (Remember, healing causes half the threat damage causes.)  T is the total threat one point of damage causes.<br>
<br>
T(X) = .75 + H * (.5 - 0.02*X)<br>
<br>
To compute the changed threat rate, compute 1 - T(X) / T(0): the ratio in threat with and without the talent.  This number is the equivalency factor relative to a talent that says "reduce all threat by a fixed percent".<br>
<br>
R = 1 - T(X) / T(0)<br>
R = 1 - (.75 + H * (.5 - 0.02*X)) / (.75 + H * .5)<br>
R = (.75 + H*.5 - .75 - H*.5 + H*0.02*X) / (.75 + H*.5)<br>
R = X * (H*0.02) / (.75 + H*.5)<br>
R = X * (H*0.04) / (1.5 + H)<br>
<br>
So each point in silent resolve is equivalent to a H*.04 / (1.5 + H) percent reduction in threat.  Here are those reduction values for different values of H:<br>
<br>
H = .5: R = 1%<br>
H = 1: R = 1.6%<br>
H = 1.25: R = 1.8%<br>
<br>
With three points spent, you get a total threat reduction of almost 5% on a fight like Felmyst, and a 3% reduction on Brutallus.  I can't really justify 5/5 and forcing the holy priests to fort the raid.  The question is...  Is the small bit of threat reduction worth losing Improved Shield, another marginally useful but mostly bad talent?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I'm not 100% convinced on that.  There was a thread on shadowpriest.com a while back considering exactly this point<br>

<br>
Antiarc made a post on that thread and explained the testing he had done on this issue.  However when the testing was looked at in more detail it I didn't think it was entirely conclusive (my username on shadowpriest.com is Karnor) and the issue was never resolved to my satisfaction.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_710584"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I just read through that thread, and there is definitely something weird going on here.  I want to do additional testing to see what is and isn't affected.  The only formula that fit the data was the one that also applied Silent Resolve to Mind Blast, which is kind of interesting.  I think the tests we want are:<br>
<br>
- Mind Blast monster, then see how much threat must be done to pull<br>
- Get hurt, Vampiric Embrace, Mind Blast, then check threat required to pull<br>
<br>
And I assume these should be done with 25% shadow threat regardless, as well as 3/5 Silent Resolve (since if it's good, we'll want that much anyway).<br>
<br>
Does anyone know how to get highly accurate estimates of exactly how much threat another player is generating?  Maybe I can summon Antiarc to this thread for more info.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I would obviously be hit capped and I would be just wasting the points in SF if I put them there. It would reduce the Amount of mana used on SW: D and SW: P. According to my calculations SW; P would be reduced to 540.5 mana from the original 575. and the SW: D would be reduced by 19 mana, my realm isn't up right now, I can't remember the actual original amount I think it was 360 or 390. <br>

</div>That spec has 42 points in shadow and doesn't have Vampiric Touch.  Read the first post in it's entirety-- it has very good comments on what talents are good and why.  It should more than answer you questions.  The short answer is that this is not a good spec, however.<br>
<br>
EDIT: At this point you are asking if it's worth cutting 8% hit for 6% mana reduction on Shadow Word Pain and Death.  No.  Getting 16% spell hit from gear alone is very hard.  In just the previous page of this thread, there was a discussion about how to scrounge up extra points for Shadow Focus, and the basic consensus was to cut mana efficiency talents, as they really aren't needed.  If you try this spec, you will sacrifice a ton of spell damage just to get spell hit on gear instead, and that in turn will cost a lot of DPS.  It's not worth trading 8% hit for 10 m/5.  Drink a mana potion if you are low on mana.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<!-- message -->
		<div id="post_message_710951"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I’m hoping for some constructive criticism regarding my shadow priest.  She’s not my “raiding toon” but I still care about doing the best I can with her even if its just ezmode content.  I’m familiar with this thread, so I know the general wisdom on a shadow priest, but I think I could use some more specific analysis to improve.<br>
<br>
Simply put, I think I can be outputting more DPS in my current gear/spec, and I’m not, and I’m not sure why.  My role is to return mana first, damage secondary, so I don’t expect to be the top DPSer in any group, but I am almost always <i> dead last</i>, even of comparably-geared classes.  I think I’m a decent player who can do better and I know my raidmates will certainly appreciate if I can save them money on mana return consumables as a result.<br>
<br>
At this point, although I’m devoting the bulk of my raiding hours to my rogue, my goal for Merapeh is to be a strong sub for lower raids like ZA and starter-T5, even if I don’t plan to take her full time into that content.  I’m part of a raiding alliance (for small guilds who can’t field raids on their own), and they often need good subs.  I want to be able to be that good sub.<br>
<br>
Anyway, this post is totally TLDR, but if anyone sees anything that stands out as totally fuckall stupid, please let me know.<br>
<br>
So… into the (probably TMI) details:<br>
<br>
Amory:<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080416093417/http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Feathermoon&amp;n=Merapeh" target="_blank">The World of Warcraft Armory</a><br>
<br>
<b>Gear</b><br>
My biggest weakness gear-wise (besides the pvp robe), is that I’m not a tailor.  I rolled her as a miner/jewelcrafter for the sake of our small guild that has no other jewelcutters and few active miners.  For the greater benefit of the guild, I wont reprofession her.  Otherwise, all my gear is from T4 content and badge gear.  I wear <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=28594" target="_blank">[Trial-Fire Trousers]</a> for trash and swap them out on boss fights for the <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=24262" target="_blank">[Spellstrike Pants]</a> so I can make the hit cap.  Once I get the 2.4 badge loot, that wont be an issue (I can probably even drop to 4/5 SF after that since I’m a Draenei but we’ll see).<br>
<br>
As far as the weak spots in my gear, I’m working on getting a new robe (I’d like the heroic MrT one, but badge one is next in line otherwise), badge pants, and a <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30038" target="_blank">[Belt of Blasting]</a>.  Of course, I would like the trinket from Heroic MrT but we’ll see how my luck goes on that.<br>
<br>
At this point, I’d say she’s geared enough for a raid starting T5, even if she’s not outputting the DPS.    I’ve done fine subbing in ZA, though was likely mostly carried by the superior DPS of everyone else.<br>
<br>
<b>Spec</b><br>
My biggest spec weakness is the three points “wasted” for silence.  I’d probably move those over to shadow power but given the general weakness of crit, I’m not sure if I would justify how much I’d miss silence outside of raids.<br>
<br>
Otherwise, my spec seems pretty cookie-cutter.<br>
<br>
<b>Playstyle</b><br>
I have a lot of UI addons (Grid, Bartender, etc) but I think the only relevant mod you’d care about is my cast bars:  Currently, I’m using DoTimer.  I tried Class Timers but I didn’t like its inability to track untargeted mobs simultaneously.<br>
<br>
I think I am okay at refreshing DoTs on time, but I am less good at keeping my spells chaining (ie, sometimes I don’t start my mind flay until my mind blast is totally done casting, rather than starting it as soon as my GCD is up mid-MB-cast).  I’m working on that and have seen some good improvement.  I’m fairly good with my trinket useage on boss fights but horrible with them on trash.  I should probably work on that but I don’t really care too much about trash DPS if we’re not struggling.  <br>
<br>
My priority system:<br>
<br>
1. VT<br>
2. Pain<br>
3. MB<br>
4. Death<br>
5. MF<br>
<br>
If I use VE, I usually put it after Pain but before MB.  I try to use it on any fight that I safely can, which is probably most everything in Tier 4 at this point between good tanks and subtly on my cloak.<br>
<br>
I suspect that I clip mind flay sometimes but I’m not sure how to tell.  I don’t use the anti-clipping macro anymore because I found it frustrating it some situations where I felt I needed to clip.<br>
<br>
My latency varies.  Sometimes it is a huge factor, but mostly it probably only effects me a small amount, and no more than most everyone else.<br>

Couple WWS you can look at (my KZ raid doesn’t bother and the older Gruul ones are expired):<br>

<br>
This group has a huge variation (some of the folks in that group are moving into Tier 6 content and some haven’t even run Karazhan), so you can’t really compare me well to the rest of the people in that raid.  But, the general thing to know is that I usually pull my weight purely by having a good DPS <i>time</i> and by living to the end, not because I’m especially great.<br>
<br>
Anyway, thoughts or comments greatly appreciated.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_711048"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'd also like to point out to you that unless you also have some other head peice to swap in for the spellstrike hood, when you put on your trial fire for trash, it's pointless.  The spellstrike set is better, when combined (because of the proc) than the trialfire trousers + spellstrike hood.<br>
<br>
You could also replace the malefic girdle with a girdle of ruination for some added spell damage.<br>
<br>
With 1152 shadow damage you should be able to sustain at least  900 dps on an encounter like gruul.  If you get a shaman to drop a totem for you you might be able to hit 1k.<br>
<br>
Like the poster before, I'm guessing you simply need to practice your spell casting rotations more.  Start your VT refresh at about 1.5 seconds, don't reup SW:P until it dissapears.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yeah, the Malefic Girdle is kinda subpar.  I was hoping to get the belt from Maulgar but that never panned out, and at this point, I'm actually only three or four primal fires away from the Belt of Blasting which I think is a tiny bit better than Ruination.  So that will be a huge upgrade very soon.<br>

Everything else requires lucky drops or a lot more badges than I have, so those will come later in time.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">That spec has 42 points in shadow and doesn't have Vampiric Touch.  Read the first post in it's entirety-- it has very good comments on what talents are good and why.  It should more than answer you questions.  The short answer is that this is not a good spec, however.<br>
<br>
EDIT: At this point you are asking if it's worth cutting 8% hit for 6% mana reduction on Shadow Word Pain and Death.  No.  Getting 16% spell hit from gear alone is very hard.  In just the previous page of this thread, there was a discussion about how to scrounge up extra points for Shadow Focus, and the basic consensus was to cut mana efficiency talents, as they really aren't needed.  If you try this spec, you will sacrifice a ton of spell damage just to get spell hit on gear instead, and that in turn will cost a lot of DPS.  It's not worth trading 8% hit for 10 m/5.  Drink a mana potion if you are low on mana.</div>

</div>No, I am not actually saying I am cutting the hit, I already said I would be hit capped. Right now I only have 2 points into SF and as soon as I get the helm from Hex Lord in ZA that will increase my hit to max without any points into SF at all. I believe that taking out those SF points and putting them into the Mana reduction would be awesome.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_711478"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->So reading a lot about the haste gear really got me thinking that haste does make a dramatic difference for a raiding shadow priest. I personally am not working on a haste set at the moment but trying to get the T6 before i start worrying about haste. If a shadow spec priest in pre-black temple or SSC gear should decide to acquire more haste gear somehow than spell damage gear, is there really much of a bonus on the damage done because of haste for a lower raiding SP as compared to a spell damage geared priest? (if say his damage is around a mere 1100).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I have looked at your armory and you do have a lot of +hit, but aren't that near to the hit cap.  Currently you have 154 hit without having made any bad gear choices - it has just ended up that way.<br>
<br>
If you get the hex lord's head you would get another +15 hit to bring you up to 169.  But that is still some way short of the 212 hit required to drop all points from shadow focus.  I guess if you could always guarantee that you have an elemental shaman in the group then you could maybe justify 0/5 shadow focus (although better hope your shaman doesn't die or get out of range on any encounter.<br>
<br>
However, even in those circumstances I would prefer to have 2 points in Improved VE rather than in Mental Agility, simply because you shouldn't be having mana issues at your level of gear.<br>
<br>
Plus as you upgrade your gear further, you will almost inevitably find that your +hit drops and you would need to respec back into shadow focus.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Antiarc made a post on that thread and explained the testing he had done on this issue.  However when the testing was looked at in more detail it I didn't think it was entirely conclusive (my username on shadowpriest.com is Karnor) and the issue was never resolved to my satisfaction.</div>

</div>Actually, looking at the math, nothing explains it.  Even if we assume SR and SA both reduce VE aggro, I get:<br>
<br>
1621*(.75 + .25*.5*.75*.96)*1.1 = 1497 - still too high.<br>
<br>
The only thing I saw that worked was to halve the heal aggro again, as if another mob was on the global threat list, and assume SA doesn't affect it, giving:<br>
<br>
1621*(.75 + .25*.25*.75*.96)*1.1 = 1444.31<br>
<br>
Which fits the profile for damage dealt.<br>

<br>
I am sitting at 143 Spell Hit (11.34%) and I am rolling with 4/5 Shadow Focus.<br>
<br>
The original post states that we only need 76 hit rating to be capped with 5/5 Shadow Focus.<br>

		<td class="alt2" style="border:1px inset">
			
				Of that 16%, ten can be negated through talents alone, meaning 76 spell hit rating is needed. For every 25 points of spell hit rating above this cap that can not be avoided, you can drop a point in shadow focus to spend elsewhere. However, never itemise for spell hit unless you need 4-6 spell hit rating to drop another point in shadow focus and have an item that gives a +damage bonus with a yellow socket.

</div>Your information was wrong.  Bosses is counted as level 73 with lv 70 players, means that they have 17% chance to resist your spells, and since bosses can always have at least 1% chance to resist, you will need 16% hit to be hit capped.<br>
<br>
16%-x%(%hit given by Shadow Focus) = % hit you need from gear.  If you have 4/5 Shadow Focus = 8% hit, you only need 8% more, which is ~101 spell hit rating.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_712798"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hey guys, I'm fairly new here. Been reading this thread off and on (haven't had time to read all 43 pages just yet though). I'm looking for tips to increase my dps. You can see my gear <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080416093417/http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Frostmane&amp;n=Gamaliel" target="_blank">here</a>. My last average dps on a boss kill (Rage Winterchill) was 700dps. I know I can hit higher than that but I'm struggling to do so. Here's my breakdown for that fight.<br>
<br>
Shadow Word Pain: 28% of overall damage totalling 37672dmg. It ticked 53 times with an average of 710 max of 882.<br>
Mind Flay: 24% of overall damage totalling 32270dmg. It ticked 44 times with an average of 733 max of 841.<br>
Mind Blast: 20% of overall damage totalling 27182dmg. it hit 11 times with an average of 2192. 8% crit max of 3070.<br>
VT: 17% of overall damage totalling 22738dmg. It ticked 36 times with an average of 631 max 776. <br>
Shadow Word Death: 8% of overall damage totalling 10809dmg. It hit 4 times average of 2022. 20% crit max of 2720.<br>
<br>
Present from 21:12'23 to 21:15'35 (52 %)<br>
<br>
DPS time : 3'06'' (97 % of presence), DPS : 702<br>
HPS time : 2mn (90 % of presence), HPS : 974<br>
<br>
Damage dealt to foes : 130,671 (4 %)<br>
Damage received : 36,719 (3 %), heals received : 86,175, overhealed 57 %<br>
Effective heals on friends : 28,040 (2 %)<br>
 <br>
Any tips or suggestions for spell rotations would be great. I will be downloading quartz tonight as I have just been manually watching it with xperl countdowns. I dont like DoTTimer.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I have looked at your armory and you do have a lot of +hit, but aren't that near to the hit cap.  Currently you have 154 hit without having made any bad gear choices - it has just ended up that way.<br>
<br>
If you get the hex lord's head you would get another +15 hit to bring you up to 169.  But that is still some way short of the 212 hit required to drop all points from shadow focus.  I guess if you could always guarantee that you have an elemental shaman in the group then you could maybe justify 0/5 shadow focus (although better hope your shaman doesn't die or get out of range on any encounter.<br>
<br>
However, even in those circumstances I would prefer to have 2 points in Improved VE rather than in Mental Agility, simply because you shouldn't be having mana issues at your level of gear.<br>
<br>
Plus as you upgrade your gear further, you will almost inevitably find that your +hit drops and you would need to respec back into shadow focus.</div>

</div>First of all you have too much spellhit. You should either respec to 3/5 shadow focus or (preferably) change your hit gear (e.g. replace Scryer's Bloodgem with Timbal).<br>
<br>
Secondly, your gem choices and enchants are far from optimal. Mystical Skyfire is worse than Ember Skyfire, spd/sta gem in robe shall be replaced, same for gem in bracers, same for gem in the wand. +13 spell critical shoulder thingie sucks hard - you do need to farm exalted, blue enchant for pants is a major slack. And get subtlety too (tho it's most prolly not needed, depends on your tanks).<br>
<br>
Regarding gear choices, check the following thread: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080421234453/http://shadowpriest.com/viewtopic.php?t=9844" target="_blank">shadowpriest.com :: View topic - Best Raiding Gear Available</a> It has gear rankings, gem rankings and talent rankings in terms of raw dps.

</div>First of all, check out this thread and make sure you follow its recommendations: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080421234453/http://shadowpriest.com/viewtopic.php?t=5209" target="_blank">shadowpriest.com :: View topic - How to fix your DPS - Maximising DPS 101</a>.<br>
Secondly, use SW: Death - it's mandatory condition for high dps. Don't be afraid, just be cautious.<br>
Thirdly, don't be afrain of cutting Mind Flays. You have good enough gear not to go OOM when doing this.<br>
<br>
And after all dps (personally for me) pretty much depends on how familiar with the fight I am and how lucky I am. E.g. on my 1st kill of Winterchill I moved much more than needed, took bad spots for DPSing, was afraid to use SW: Death. Looking at your damage breakdown by spells, I can suppose you moved a lot as well.<br>

I've looked through your analysis file and agree with your conclusions that neither SR nor SA affect VE.<br>
<br>
One tiny correction (makes no difference to the conclusion) is that one of the calculations on the second test is out by a tiny bit:<br>
<br>
base threat: (1383*.75 + 346*.5)*1.1 = 1332.925 to pull<br>
<br>
This equation actually calculates as 1331.275.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Easy to test, and I think when I tested it I found that the initial threat of VE was &lt;5, presumably zero (i.e. *just* enough to put you on the threat table of a mob).<br>
<br>
Test protocol for those who would like to replicate: VE a mob.  Have someone take a very small white swing at it (a naked level 10 shaman with a club, for example, would be good).  Ideally the white swing will hit for &lt;5.  See how long it takes the mob to switch to the shaman.<br>
<br>
Amonra, not sure why I was off there.  I think I may have used the previous pull's VE value or something.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_714332"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Interesting, looks like I'm dropping those SR points. Also, I'll vouch for meditation being better than focused mind point for point. Couple fights in BT hurt (council, mother), but for first half of Sunwell I haven't had mana issues. This may be partially due to having other support, such as JoW on Brutallus, or having downtime on Fel Myst, but it seems like a solid tradeoff given the issues we're gonna have with +hit on gear. <br>
<br>
Also, Spirit Tap on skeletons for Fel Myst can help as well. Haven't yet found a use for Blackout in Sunwell.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>... goddamnit.  The .98 factor needs to be applied across the board.<br>
<br>
Thanks, Graf.<br>
<br>
edit:  That said, the results still work out as SR not affecting VE.  It actually makes it more clear.<br>
<br>
Test 1: Ironspine Petrifier<br>
<br>
Routh deals 1397 damage to petrifier<br>
Routh heals 349 damage<br>
Buppi: 34+35+34+33+34+35+35+33+35+34+34+34+34+35+35+34+35+34+68+35+35+34+34++35+34+35+69+33+  34+34+34+35+34+35+35+33+68<br>
aggro onto buppi at 1303-1371 damage<br>
<br>
base threat:<br>
<br>
(1397*.75 + 349*.5)*1.1*.98 = 1318 to pull (SR/SA do not affect VE) - works<br>
(1397*.75 + 349*.5*.75)*1.1*.98 = 1271 to pull (SA affects VE) - DISPROVEN<br>
(1397*.75 + 349*.5*.88)*1.1*.98 = 1295 to pull (SR does, SA does not) - DISPROVEN<br>
<br>
Test 2: Timber worg<br>
<br>
Routh deals 1383 damage to timber worg<br>
Routh heals 346 via VE<br>
33+12+13+13+13+26+14+13+12+33+34+34+33+34+34+34+33+13+13+13+12+13+13+13+13+34+33+67+3  4+33+34+34+33+67+33+13+13+14+12+13+12+13+13+34+67+34+34+34+34+34+33<br>
aggro onto buppi at 1297-1330 damage<br>
<br>
base threat:<br>
<br>
(1383*.75 + 346*.5)*1.1*.98 = 1305 to pull<br>
(1383*.75 + 346*.5*.88)*1.1*.98 = 1283 to pull (SR does, SA does not) - DISPROVEN<br>
<br>
(The second test had a repeated 13/12 pair giving Buppi a fake 35 threat because reading the new combat log by hand can be prone to error.)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Good catch.  It looks like the answer is yes, because mind blast rank 8 dealt 1383 damage.  After discounting shadow form and darkness, this is 1093 unamplified damage.  Given an average damage of 437 with 0 spell damage, that's 656 extra damage from spell damage.  With a coefficient of 3/7ths, that estimates a spell damage value of 1531, well over the gear actually equipped.  Maybe he had +102 spell damage from the shaman's wrath of air totem.  Unless we hear otherwise, it seems likely the cloak was equipped.<br>
<br>
EDIT: Beaten<br>
<br>
At any rate, I ran through all of the numbers and in the second test, none of the possible equations fit.  It looks like the monster stayed on you even after it shouldn't have with no threat reduction on Vampiric Embrace.<br>
<br>
One thing Antiarc recommended was having one person body pull, a second person does mind blast, then a third person draws aggro through punches.  Apparently this removes possible residual aggro preferences, which might account for the discrepancy.  Now that said, the 2% change in threat just makes it even less likely that threat talents apply to vampiric embrace.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Cloak was equipped; it was immediately post-raid, so I may have had flask/food/oil or some subset thereof still up.<br>

edit: Bah.  4/5 T6, so 10% bonus to MB damage.  <br>
<br>
(437 + K*3/7)*1.1*1.1*1.15 = 1383<br>

</div>Well, I purchased the Ember Skyfire diamond, used shadow word death more and stayed still more. Also replaced some of my gems. I still need to rework some gear so that I don't have so much spell hit. But here's my armory <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080421234453/http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Frostmane&amp;n=Gamaliel" target="_blank">thing </a>again. I purchased a new ring with some badges, next will be a new pair of pants. And I got the pattern Mantle of Nimble Thought, just a few bits of reagents away from making it.<br>
<br>
Also I got officer permission so here is a link to my wowwebstats <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080421234453/http://wowwebstats.com/wn3ysga3etziq?a=28&amp;s=7620-7890" target="_blank">page</a>.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_718746"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I think you should wear your MH or even kara ring over the band of crimson fury, replace your scryers bloodgem - if you have the cash blessings deck, or battlemaster,  or even one of the quest rewards (there is a green one with 27 +dmg static and a use boost iirc) since over hit is just worthless.  Crit has SOME value - even if not much.  <br>
<br>
  I am not much good at reading WWS usefully, but anetheron is a boss where it is important to keep DoT's on him and the infernal (since that will maintain a 5 stack of weaving and misery), and in a 4min30sec fight I see 3 trinket uses.  If I am correct in my estimation they both have a 1 min CD if you chain use them?  So I reckon you could get 5 uses in a 4min+  fight,  there is some missed dps there.  Some people macro their trinkets with SW:P - not perfect but stops missing a use, I would prefer to macro them to VT since it is refreshed more often, or even mind blast - anything that takes out the need to remember.  It is only a bad idea when you want to save DPS for a certain phase (e.g evocate on curator) but better than missing multiple uses in most cases.<br>
<br>
  Vitality on boots, I have 12 sta and would suggest you consider it.  I am not saying vitality is not helpful - I have never tried it. However, Najentus is going to do 8k raid wide damage and you are not going to have much spare - self shielding will rape your mana.  In fact several bosses will do high raid damage. For that reason and the obvious extra damage you should get epic spellthread too.  <br>
<br>
  Are you going to get the crafted bracers soon too? Because otherwise bracer enchant needs doing. (mats do suck though :-()<br>
<br>

</div>Level 73 mobs have roughly 23 (sorry, I forgot the exact number) resistance that can not be removed with CoS or Spell Penetration.  You should have roughly a 4-5% mitigation rate on boss mobs over time.<br>
<br>
On your WWSs, the SWD mitigation rate on Hydross/Lurker was skewed by only having 10 casts, 1 full resist and 4 partial resists.  Bad luck in a small sample size.<br>
<br>
On the mag fight your SWD had 4 casts, and 2 partial resist -- bad luck.  Your SW:P had a 7% mitigation rate -- did all the channelers get CoS on them?

		<div id="post_message_724073"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I think 1400 is pretty much the ceiling for you in that sort of gear.  If you look at WWS for Brutallus fights (they are searchable by fight), you will notice that SPs dps ranges from 1400-1600, with the typical number being around 1450.  Because we are a dot class, our dps does not scale very well and our place on the dmg meters will fall the better geared everyone in the raid gets. <br>

There is another thread that talks about the scaling issue of SPs.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Thanks Meltface. Yes your correct the most of channelers did not have CoS on them. We had a few new players there and  it was a terrible run, as you could see. <br>
<br>
I think just glancing at the WWS report which I used to do with my mage, is not possible now. to get the full picture I will have to spend a bit more time. <br>

		<div id="post_message_724134"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->You should be hitting at least 1400 dps at Brutallus, with a properly debuffed mob.  By this time you should have 4 pc T6 and the necessary accessories.  DPS differs beyond that depending on if you soak, if you get bloodlusts, if there are a lot of drums in your group, if you get Burned, etc.   If you get really bad luck on all those counts, then maybe you wont even hit 1400.   My best so far is just shy of 1500 -- not having to soak, but no bloodlusts, getting burned once, and one person with drums in the group.  (We also didn't have a Nightfall on our OT -- that's another consideration, although that's being fixed in 2.4.2 to be no longer viable anyways)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_724276"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I don't really agree with most of what has been said in the past 5 posts or so. A single belt or bracers isn't going to give you a 200-300 DPS upgrade. Certainly not going from Waistwrap of Infinity to T6 Belt, or Devastation Bracers to T6. I'd go as far to say that anyone wearing 4pc T6 and some/all equivalent BT/Hyjal gear can get to 1500. Snowy is on point in that it hugely depends on your group makeup. Soaker, Burns, Conc Aura, Earth Shield, Drums, Bloodlust/Heroism, WoA totem are all going to play a huge part though so YMMV.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

It works quite nicely for me. You will need to DL a program to convert it to tga format (I used Advance batch Converter v.4.0). Also, save it somewhere you can find it later. The texture gets overwritten when you update Quartz.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>You can add your custom-texture into the SharedMedia addon so you dont have to fix it every update. How to do that is explained in the addon-files. In this thread you can find a very useful batch-file for that purpose: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080501172012/http://www.wowace.com/forums/index.php?topic=6063.0" target="_blank">MyMedia</a><br>

		<div id="post_message_725128"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Yeah but that isn't a clean solution. Ideally you want it to work with all channelled spells, like evocation, arcane missiles, blizzard, invisibility and whatnot (although invisibility isn't really a channelled spell). To further make this complicated, set bonuses can impact the evocation time and number of ticks. Doing that patch will basically show that cast bar for every single spell, and additionally will not show your latency bar on every tick.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_725330"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->My question is regarding hit rating and the hit cap.  My current guild is only 5/6 SSC, 3/4 TK and 3/5 MH.<br>
<br>
I am leveling a shadow priest and was looking at other shadow priest in the guild to get an idea of gear and talents and compare to how they preform in raids and I notice one SP had 5/5 shadow focus and then an addition 174 hit rating (approximately 13.5% hit) so I sent him the follow message:<br>
<br>
<i>I was bored and was looking at guildies in the armory and noticed you have 23.71% hit and hit rating is capped at 16% for casters, which means you have 7.71% too much.<br>
<br>
The easiest way to dump some would be to replace your rings and remove 2-3 points from the Shadow Focus talent, which is giving you 10% hit with 5 points in it.<br>
<br>
Now I am only going by the gear you were wearing when you logged off so if you change your gear before a raid then I apologize.</i><br>
<br>
and this was his response:<br>
<br>
<i>this is something you didn't know obviously my friend. last patch they made hit rating increase the cap of the ACTUAL hit rating cap that we are given. right now i'm at 29% more hit rating CAP capable instead of 16%. which actually makes what spell hit is used for a better thing if you have more of it. cause remember now your sacraficing haste for spell hit. they can't stack anymore with any combination of gear you get thats why we got nerfed and no one knows about that nerf with us locks and shadow priests. thats why all i aim for is spell hit. i rather have the dps than the mana regen from mindflay when i have like 85 spell haste rating.thats what haste is good for on a spriest. now spell hit and spell haste are 2 new forms of play style. so i guess its another way to expand your abilities so others or the enemy can't cope with you. but yeah man i pick spell hit so thats my play style.<br>
<br>
<br>
Its cool i know you didn't know good looking out. but if you see anything else with my spriest always feel free to share anything you see out of place or think it would be better than the other. i'm all ears when it comes to this type of shit. :-).</i><br>
<br>
Obviously what he said isnt making much sense to me and I have looked through the patch notes and also looked at other shadow priest to see if any of them had excess hit rating.  If this is true can someone please link some information or tell me what to look for.  I will continue to search and if I find something I will delete my post.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_725381"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I've been thinking about how to modify Quartz to show channeled spell ticks, and one texture will never be sufficient.  Not even having one texture per spell would work.  That's because you need to account for pushback as well as latency.  If you take half a second of pushback, Quartz needs to render the next tick half a second later on the bar, since Mind Flay won't do damage until you've channeled it for a full second.  That said, it should be pretty easy to compute these stop offsets and render an additional blue latency bar whose left end is right at the next spell tick.  That way you could cut the spell at any one of those ranges.<br>
<br>
The evocation case would require much more work, however.  That's because Evocation's ticks occur at each 2 second heartbeat tick from the server.  They aren't anchored at the spell cast.  This also means that getting pushback in you evocation won't change the ideal time to break the cast like it would for Mind Flay or Arcane Missiles.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I have been browsing WWS charts for Brutallus and the only people i saw that broke 1500dps are people who have over 1400 shw dmg unbuffed with at least 100 haste rating.

1500 is about where I'd expect to see people top out in pre-SWP gear.<br>

As to the quartz thing - a thirded texture 'slid' appropriately would work as an initial pass at a latency-appropriate MF bar.  Doing the more general case is actually fairly complex.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>If you have good raid healing (read: resto shamans) than you should only be missing 1 SW:D, which is the one you would cast but its right before the 3rd Meteor Slash. Burn hurts your dps a lot more as you have to run at least a little distance and then you cant use SW:D for at least 30s, probably more like 40s as your burn healers will be not so pleased. <br>
<br>
The most dps I have gotten on Brut is 1547 with a resto shaman (so 1 lust) and no drums. Also, I am very skeptical of Mr. "I do 1800 dps but cant get above 1400 dps on Brut." You do know that listing Curator/Netherspite numbers is cheating, right?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_725480"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I wouldn't necessarily say "horrendously". There are a few seconds before and after the 3rd stack of burn that you cannot use SWD (or shouldn't really) other than that I SWD through slash stack 1 and 2 and am prepared to shield myself if something goes horribly wrong. Obviously if 3 people in your soak group have burn and you're gonna take a 8k+ slash you don't want to SWD but it's perfectly viable to time the casting so that you get healed up right afterwards.<br>
<br>
You can also time your casts so that you're refreshing your instants or just starting a cast (thereby mostly nullifying the pushback). Since slash is on a hard timer it just requires that you think a few steps ahead and plan for this.<br>

All right, now specifically...I have no idea what the hell he means by "29% more hit rating CAP capable."  Bosses will resist spells due to level 17% of the time.  You can eliminate 16% of that.  I have never seen or heard anything to suggest otherwise.<br>

It really doesn't cost us anything standing outside the soak group, since our shamans all bounce Chain Heal off the tanks.  There's one or two people soaking outside the VE group but they get patched up with the CH bounces.

		<div id="post_message_726387"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Phew, got through the whole thread - took me a few days and I think I skipped a little  :p<br>
<br>
Anyway, I have been playing a Mage since release but, due to guild requirements, I have had to start playing on my alt Shadow Priest (a story you don't want to hear). Been running TK instances to hell to get revered for the helm enchant  &gt;.&lt;<br>
<br>

<br>
I have only been playing this character for 1 Hyjal and 1 BT clear (and 1 Kalecgos kill) so have pretty decent gear for only half a raids week of playing her. Any comments on gear spec would be appreciated as I don't have any in-depth knowledge and have only been playing the class for 1 week  =/  I understand all caster type raid issues, as have played a Mage extensively. I have the Kalecgos pants, but missed out on the T6 shoulders so am unable to wear them atm.<br>
<br>
I try to maintain 100% VT+SW:P uptime (btw, how do I check that in WWS? I cannot find the option) and MB+SW every cooldown (hp pool permitting) and MF inbetween. I use my inner focus with a trinket then MB+SW instantly to get the benefit on both (I believe it works the same as Mage shatter/combustion with an instant cast following, I tested it once and the free mana cost was associated with both, so I assume it works).<br>

<br>
This is the second half of BT (Teron -&gt; Illidan). I cannot recall, but I was switched between the healer group (with resto shaman) and the caster DPS group (with elemental shaman). There was another SPriest in the raid (who gquit that night =/). I got my 4pc bonus after this nights raid, so I was running with 2pc only from Hyjal. I had very bad gear for this run, so I am more interested in uptimes and such rather then DPS.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
As for gear, I am curious as to what gear I should spend haste on and, in particular, what gear I should aim for. Ofc, hit capping as an SPriest is very easy at T6 level - especially with talents. But I figure the more hit I can get from gear (without gemming for it) the more points I can drop out of Shadow Focus and put into other places (mind blast, imp VE). I have ~80 badges atm, and considering getting the badge vendor spellblade as I would consider it better then the Hyjal trash mace and there is still 2 people ahead of me for the Illidan staff.<br>
<br>
Which brings me to my next questions, which I don't believe there is a definitive answer out there for : haste. I read that haste scales just as good as (or better then) damage above ~1400 shadow damage (raid buffed). Which makes the Illidan staff very sexy. Is this accurate or are my eyes bleeding?<br>
<br>
I run heroic MgT daily, but Timbal's just doesn't want to drop for me ... and I am also collecting Blessings cards for the Crusade card. As you can see by my armory, I am also levelling LWing for drums for Brut. Is there anything else I could be working towards (Sha'tar rep is coming)?<br>
<br>
I have sub enchant mats ready for the Nethervoid Cloak, and don't want to waste mats on making/enchanting the haste bracers with the 3 tokens per boss kill we will be offspeccing bracers soon enough. We do ZA Bear runs almost every reset, so am looking to get the haste boots/ring from there, as well as hopefully the hex lords trinket (though I already took one on my Mage, so would have to pass for some first). Also considering the haste belt from Supremus, depending on the haste consensus.<br>
<br>
Long winded I know, but I always try to play my class 110% and do everything I can to perform well. Any comments/tips would be greatly appreciated.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>You have to do this manually, at the top of the WWS pages, next to the date, there is a fight duration and if you mouse over it it gives you the duration in seconds.<br>
Divide that by three, as your DoT's tick every three seconds, and that is the maximum <i>theoretical</i> amount of DoT ticks you could have had on that fight.  It will very rarely be that high for a few reasons like the tank establishing threat and VT having a cast time.<br>
I haven't got to play my shadowpriest much as it is on a different server I don't log into very often but when I did SW:P would have a better uptime as it is instant and you can get it up while running into position.<br>
<br>
It would be nice to hear from the full time shadow priests what kind of uptimes you are consistently getting on both DoT's.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_727179"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'm at a loss as to why I did so well on this recent gorefiend we did,<br>
<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080502162410/http://wowwebstats.com/5sedarf1rezti?a=9&amp;s=7503-7758" target="_blank">Anoch - WWS</a><br>
<br>
Now I'm certainly not trying to brag, as I don't consider myself a very good player, and looking at other WWS parses something definetly seems amiss. Theres something going on causing the high dps which isn't present in the other parses. Also I never really do this well at all, in the past I'd never broke 1450, and then got the 4t6 and zhardoom (which gave enough haste to fully reap benefits of 5/5 imp. MB) and managed 1550 the previous week, which was a faster kill too.<br>
<br>
Firstly, we had a lock with 13% cos. With 10% cos the dps would still have been roughly 1621, which still seems too high. Then there was also two destruction locks present, maybe I was lucky with timing of my spells/powerups and ISB? I didn't have concentration aura, so the doom blossoms were causing interrupts, which further adds to my confusion.<br>
<br>
Is there anything glaringly obvious I've missed in that parse that could be causing inflated numbers? <br>
<br>
Also, with regard to the talk about Brutallus being different to other fights hence expecting different (lower) dps, assuming you aren't getting burned, and not soaking meteor slash, is the fight that much different to a gorefiend outside of it being longer? (I've not read much on brutallus so far, we are currently working on Kalecgos.) I'm just curious as to how much worse I would perform.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

 I am assuming WWS does not get distorted by being a ghost. I can see no sign of it.<br>
<br>
   You have totems and bloodlust, used destruction potions, but no drums, and an atrophy.  You have some pretty hefty mind blasts at 32% crit which is high. For no conc. aura the matrydom appears to have procced to help avoid interruption. <br>
<br>
  Basically you just did well, and WWS seems to be normal.  Teron is a fight I always do well on cause it really is a tank and spank all out DPS until you get debuffed. Ideal.  Jealous of devouring plague ^^.<br>
<br>
  Plenty of comments at top of page about brutallus. Burning hurts DPS a lot. Slash soaking just takes SWD out of rotation on occasion.<br>
<br>
 Xei - the badge dagger has 247 +dmg to my knowledge, and your armoury shows you in jaded crystal dagger which has only 185 and a +40 dmg enchant. <br>
<br>
 Badge dagger  + soulfrost is a 74 (ish) increase unless I am in some way confused?  Unless you have the hammer from BT/MH trash which would make more sense.  Either way I think hit is easy enough to go with badge dagger and buy gems on mage (or just get from Gbank surely?). Also, on a side note, I have not seen the badge blade but the mace is horribly ugly.<br>
<br>
  I love that green trinket (mine is still in bank) but crusader is very nice with a bit of practice at keeping a stack.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Yeah I did get a proc, thats due to being crit by a construct (Yes, people still fail to kill them in time).<br>

I do notice that the log contains 6.2 million damage.... yet Gorefiend has 5 million hp. So its counting extra damage somewhere, I just cant figure out where it is shown within the log. When I total all of the individual damage it only totals 4.6 million aswell. Something is definetly wrong with that parse I'm just buggered if I know what!</div>

</div>The reason the numbers don't add up is because the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080502162410/http://wowwebstats.com/5sedarf1rezti?s=7503-7758&amp;a=140" target="_blank">Vengeful Spirit</a>'s are being counted as pets, meaning the damage they do to the constructs is included in the total damage done by your raid to mobs.<br>
This seems to happen with the new version of the WWS client and I see no way of changing it like the old version with the <i>actors</i> list where you could classify what each was.<br>
<br>
Either way you did well and it gives you something to aim at repeating or beating, the Mind Blast crit rate may make that tricky but there is room for more DoT uptime.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>This totally depends on the fight.  On fights like Brutallus, our mages tell me that they never have enough mana.  Felmyst is completely threat capped though, so mana regen isn't the top priority.<br>
<br>
By the way, we ran numbers on Shadow Word Death versus Pain, and I believe it's always a slight increase to cast pain first and then death (assuming you'll get a reasonable number of pain ticks before the monster dies).  We should check this math again, however.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
For the past 2 weeks we had a growing mourning in the guild from our 2 spriests because our warlocks started to switch to fire in order to test DPS gains and losses.<br>
We came up with:<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080502162410/http://wowwebstats.com/ilx2jrrpbbi4o?s=9687-10040" target="_blank">Wow Web Stats</a><br>
3 Fire Warlocks - 1 Burn each on priest<br>
<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080502162410/http://wowwebstats.com/a4kam5rhbgzbi?s=6453-6807" target="_blank">Wow Web Stats</a><br>
1 Fire/2 shadow - no burns<br>
I was expecting a net-DPS-loss of 100-150 for each spriest with no ISBs up, which pretty much hit the target.<br>
<br>
Did any of you/your guilds test it through as well or decide on a guideline for your warlocks?<br>

		<div id="post_message_728007"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Here's what to do to figure out whether you should use SW:D or SW:P:<br>
<br>
1. Figure out your average SW:P tick and divide this by 3<br>
2. Figure out your average SW:D hit (factor in crits) and divide this by 12.<br>
3. Prioritize whichever is higher.<br>
<br>
Ex: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080502162410/http://wowwebstats.com/cdjx4r65mr3l5?s=4110-4372&amp;a=18" target="_blank">Balkoth - WWS</a><br>
<br>
SW:D = 2318 plus factoring in 18% crit.<br>
2318 * 82 = 190076<br>
3477 * 18 = 62586<br>
Total = 252662<br>
Divide by 100 = 2527 (rounded up)<br>
Divide by 12 = 211 (rounded up)<br>
<br>
SW:P = 835<br>
Divide by 3 = 278 (rounding down)<br>
<br>
Using Shadow Word Pain is clearly better in this clear, specificially 33% better and I gain about 100 damage each time I prioritize SW:P over SW:D.  If this happens every 30 seconds in a 4 minute fight, I gain 800 damage divided by 240, or 3.33 DPS.<br>
<br>
So yes, whether you prioritize SW:D or SW:P will make almost no difference.  Even MB versus SW:P shouldn't be a massive difference.<br>
<br>
There are 3 basic rules for Shadow Priest DPS which make more difference than any other things you can do:<br>
<br>
1. Never, ever, ever stop casting<br>
2. Keep your non Mind Flay spells on "cooldown"<br>
3. Minimize the effect of latency as best you can<br>
<br>
Edit: Quick and dirty MB math as a comparison, just by claiming MB will do 15% more damage.<br>
<br>
2527 * 1.15 = 2906<br>
With 5/5 Imp Mind Blast it has a 7 second cooldown<br>
2906 divided by 7 = 415<br>
<br>
That's an advantage of 137 DPS each time you use a global cooldown in favor of MB, or 206 damage.  If we again say it happens every 30 seconds, that's 206 divided by 30, which is 7 DPS.  Yes, you gain less than 7 DPS by prioritizing MB over SW:P.  Again, look to those three rules.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_728577"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I've got a question bout group setups, not 100% sure if i should post it here, guess it should go in a warlock or mage thread or something but i tend to follow this thread mainly so just tought i'd dump it here.<br>
<br>
Available classes : <br>
2 destro warlocks<br>
1 boomkin<br>
1 elemental shaman<br>
2 shadowpriests<br>
3 firemages<br>
1 bm hunter<br>
<br>
how would you organize em for max dps ?<br>
<br>
I'm not 100% sure about who benefits most from what, but my idea is : <br>
<br>
Spriest - Shaman - tripple Mage<br>
<br>
Spriest - Boomkin - bm Hunter - duo Warlock<br>
<br>
I know one of the mages is a bit undergeared, so perhaps swap him with the boomkin and have him keep up scorches ?<br>
resulting in <br>
<br>
Spriest Shaman Boomkin Mage Mage<br>
Spriest Hunter Lock Lock Scorchmage ?<br>
<br>
My main reason for making this setup is that mages benefit most from the extra crit (returns of mana + ignite), while warlocks just get the critdmg ?<br>
<br>
Another issue being bloodlusts, chain em for a melee group ? or spread em over melee and mages executing or ? <br>
<br>
and yes, you did guess correctly, we are working on brutallus ^^<br>
<br>
Any insights would be appreciated.<br>
If i'm totally offtopic here just point me in the right direction and i'll bugger off ^^<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I think crit is at least as valuable for personal dps for a warlock as a mage + you get better ISB uptime that increases all shadow dps. <br>

Regarding Kalman's threat test, am I reading that right that <i>neither</i> Shadow affinity nor Silent resolve works with VE?

</div>Shadowpriests mean a lot less lifetapping then just a mana tide. 3% Crit is NOT negligible to ISB uptime, seeing as I always want ISB up, and I'm burning off his charges with Mindblast and shadowword death. With the totem and moonkin aura, my lock gets another 8% Crit.  That's pretty sweet for me.<br>
<br>
Shame on you for leaving the class we rely on most for damage boosting out in the cold =-P<br>
<br>
For reference, I'm usually in a group with our top dps destro lock, our top dps mage, our Boomkin and our top dps elemental shaman. It works out wonderfully.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>To back up this point, having a 1400 DPS shadow priest in my group can reduce the number of life taps I need over a 6 minute standstill fight (Brutallus basically) from 17 to 3.  That's about 19 extra seconds of DPS time at my haste rating.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>A) As Warlocks progress in Sunwell we get an increasing hit cap issue.<br>
B) A proper spriest will return ~20k mana on Brutallus, thats 9-10 taps less.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_729831"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I suppose its since we don't have a full time Ele Sham in every one of our fights, but I can't see making your main gear set rely on around ToW hit. At least for us, too many of the fights in Sunwell so far have called for separate individual groups which can't be stacked to full synergy, ala Kalec's portal groups and Felmyst's Mass Dispel groups. On these fights we're often pushing our number of Ranged DPS as is and unable to bring an Ele Sham(We run 3 Hunters) in the first place, so our Locks building their main gear set for assuming ToW just isn't ideal. Maybe our locks are just too lazy to have multiple sets for different situations.<br>
<br>
We also run 3 Warlocks, and the last sim I ran showed 3% crit for 2 of our Locks as a very small increase in ISB uptime. Meanwhile our Mages are ususally our top DPS and gain extra benefit during Molten Fury from the 3% crit. The Mana Tide also can turn those 3 Life Taps into 0 Life Taps needed throughout a fight, still increasing DPS for the Locks.<br>
<br>
I fear we're getting horribly offtopic, but I guess what I'm trying to get at is the dif between an Ele Sham with Mages or Locks is situational per your guild, how many Locks you bring, how much DPS your Locks do vs your Mages, how good your SPs are, how on top of using Mana pots your Locks are, etc. It's going to vary per guild which is the best setup.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>
