		<div id="post_message_521028"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'm looking at : <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080416031258/http://wowjutsu.com/vault/raids/bt/illidan/" target="_blank">http://wowjutsu.com/vault/raids/bt/illidan/</a><br>
Scroll down the list, and see the warglaives (32837), and see : <a class="q5" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32837" target="_blank">[Warglaive of Azzinoth]</a><br>
* 31x Mainhand, owned by 100% rogues(100% combat spec), 0% warriors<br>
* 28x Offhand, owned by 100% rogues(100% combat spec), 0% warriors<br>
<br>
Now, as a rogue i obviously wholeheartedly agree with this, however i'm curious behind the reasoning that other guilds use.<br>
Both weapons being 109 DPS, surely any fury warrior would be producing massive ammounts of saliva at the mere thought of owning these, or not?<br>
<br>
Are there better alternatives for warriors?<br>
Is the upgrade for warriors very small compared to rogues? (1.4 sec offhand with huge amounts of haste is just.. insane)<br>
Is the increased threat simply better managed by your rogues? Would warriors have threat issues?<br>
Do warriors prefer 2 weapons of equal speed due to flurry mechanics? Such as <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32262" target="_blank">[Syphon of the Nathrezim]</a><br>
Are all endgame warriors using 2H MS spec with <a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=30902" target="_blank">[Cataclysm's Edge]</a> ?<br>
<br>
As a rogue, swapping the Talon+S2 sword -&gt; 2x warglaives shows about 163 DPS increase according to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080416031258/http://rogue.raidcal.com/" target="_blank">http://rogue.raidcal.com/</a> (post haste nerf)<br>
What would be the estimate increase a warrior could expect?<br>
<br>
I'm curious, if your guild has managed to defeat illidan, why have the rogues been given the Warglaive and not your fury warrior?<br>
Or rather, why have no warriors bothered to roll or pay dkp for this item?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
But i agree on the general idea of threat-capping for the warriors pre-2.3. The rogues aggro-dump is just far more efficient, you dont have to rebuff them after <br>
<br>
The question about offhand speed. In Theory, in most cases 2 of the 3 flurry hits will be aten by the offhand. This can be controversly discussed if its bad due to the smaller damage range, lower crits, proc benefit etc.<br>
<br>
For rogues its perfect, fast offhand, slow mainhand. You get a really good offhand for combat potency proc and a slow mainhand for sinister strike or hemo.<br>
<br>
From pure pve view, the gain is bigger for a rogue than a warrior. But the decision is rather being made by the Guild Master / Raid Leader or DKP-System in most cases.<br>

</div>At first glance the set does look to be mainly aimed at rogues due to the fact that SS or hemo spamming requires a very slow mainhand, 2.8 being about the slowest you can get at that level.<br>
And the 1.4 speed offhand would produce crazy amounts of Combat Potency, or poison procs.<br>
PPM effects are also increased when using a slow weapon.<br>
As far as i know rogues are also more dependant on spamming instant attacks with their mainhand than warriors are, is heroic strike still used as a rage dump?<br>
<br>
The reason i mentioned flurry was because (as mentioned by one of our warriors) supposedly flurry can produce 4 hasted hits instead of 3, if both your weapons are of equal speed.<br>
Obviously i can't test this, but that'd mean 1 hit would have 30% extra speed/dps.<br>
Where with a 1.4 vs 2.8 speed weapon that would only occur half the time.<br>
Perhaps a fury warrior could give insight into this mechanic?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I think threat capping is a big issue in this. With guilds gearing up and waiting for the Sunwell to grab world firsts they are trying to optimise their raid as best posssible. A rogue with these can do the maximum potential DPS without risk of pulling aggro whereas a Warrior may struggle pre 2.3. But as said plenty of warriors have them too, I think its mainly guild mechanics.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_521071"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->For us it was partly threat issues (our fury warrior at the time was virtually always threat capped rather than damage capped) and that the rogue who got them has 100% attendance while our DPS warriors have never been the most reliable bunch (as shown by both the DPS warriors who were raiding with us quitting since the first illidan kill). I would've liked to have seen the warglaives on a tauren though.<br>
<br>
The rogue who got them is also guild/raid leader, so he kinda deserved it anyway. We don't use a DKP system, so there was no mucking around in that respect.<br>
<br>
I would guess threat-&gt;damage and that rogues (in general) do more damage total is the normal reason why there's a lot more rogues around with them than warriors.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I think you are overestimating the value of 10 % more threat reduction. The reasons rogues don't pull aggro is vanish, not having 29 % passive aggro reduction. A warrior going all out (-&gt; spamming cleave/heroic strike) will still hit a cap pretty quickly unless you support your MT beyond what is usual (at least to my knowledge most raids don't put a shaman in the MT group nowadays for example).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

It was a sick DPS weapon, and rogues could handle the threat most of the time. I kinda wish they'd just scrap legendarys in total and replace them with normal epics that just look damned cool but are legendary in status (so the warglaives would look the same but be 100 DPS with a less sick proc). It would reduce the amount of whining about which classes get them, and let them be status symbols (see the other thread about status symbols). It would also let the drop rate be a bit higher, as at the moment it's a complete lottery - the whole Atiesh system was nice imo.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I can remember the many discussions I had with random people about how weak a legendary Thunderfury was when the basic stats were known but the item wasn't attainable yet since BWL wasn't released yet, very few people at the time had anticipated how good the proc was.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				 I kinda wish they'd just scrap legendarys in total and replace them with normal epics that just look damned cool but are legendary in status (so the warglaives would look the same but be 100 DPS with a less sick proc). It would reduce the amount of whining about which classes get them, and let them be status symbols (see the other thread about status symbols). It would also let the drop rate be a bit higher, as at the moment it's a complete lottery - the whole Atiesh system was nice imo.

I agree. It seems counter productive to add Legandary over normal weapons because they don't bring anything positive and do bring some negative. As said if they were just an epic set that dropped from him they'd still look as cool, still be as coveted and still rock the DPS charts. They just create a lot of problems in distribution and how you add them. Also, though not a gameplay subject really, the lore tends to focus on heroes weapons if they are a melee class, but on their magic casting abilities if they are a caster class, so those guys get left in the cold a little.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Why? How does it not benefit every single person in your raid if your rogues are all sporting legendary weapons? Sure it means you have absolutely no chance to possibly catch up to them in dps, but so what?<br>
<br>
Legendaries ARE a status symbol, the issue does not lie in the fact that having them drop is counter productive and do not bring anything positive. The issue lies in the fact that a guild downing Illidan twice could conceivable get a full set, while the guild that has been farming Illidan for 3 months hasn't seen any yet.<br>
<br>
Atiesh was done in a much better way. 40 items needed, not THAT uncommon of a drop, so any guild that puts the time in would get enough splinters to start the "meaty" of the quest. While drops like TF were so rare we farmed MC for a year and never  completed one, yet know 2 guilds that had 2, one of which completed a TF in their first ever MC clear to Domo. This is the problem, not legendaries in general. It should be something you can work towards, luck should only make it a bit faster, not decide entirely if you get it or not.<br>
<br>
I am really surprised so many people are posting that legendaries bring nothing positive to this game. Are people so selfish that the idea is "If I can't have it, why should you!" ? Do you not see the benefit of your melee DPS being able to put out even more dps? There has been rumour (confirmed now I believe?) of a hunter legendary comming out soonish, maybe in The Sunwell. Why would this be a problem for anyone? Sure, maybe you have 1 hunter in your raid... and? Now he hits harder. This is bad for everyone else...how?<br>
<br>
Item color (green, blue, purple, orange) reflects how common an item is, nothing more. Orange means its really really really rare. Why would coloring them purple make a difference?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_521155"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->With the 2.3 changes reducing fury threat, a lot of people have mentioned the WW change as being the main reason they are better for rogues.  However, I'd like to see the math on that...WW is a fairly small component of a fury warrior's damage pre-2.3, and adding an extra offhand hit every ~10 secs (depending on spec) isn't really that huge.  I wonder which is actually more dps?<br>
<br>
Anyway, our guild uses a "who's been around longer and has better attendance and does pro things a lot, etc." type method for legendaries and other such things.   I was first on the warglaive list despite us having a great rogue.  However, I hate the idea of having loot like this assigned to me even if people think I deserve it, so I declined.

</div>Since whirlwind is a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080412022943/http://thottbot.com/s1680" target="_blank">normalized instant</a>, your math is somewhat wrong. You have to use the 2.4 normalization factor to calculate the damage bonus from attack power, like this:<br>
(109.3*1.4 + 250*2.4) * 0.625 = 470.6<br>
(100.2*2.8 + 250*2.4) * 0.625 = 550.4<br>

I chose page three, because about 2/3 the way down the page with testing numbers that contradict the "extra attack from weapons of the same speed" theory.  In the chart with the yellow row, look at the line called "% extra attacks".  If same speed weapons got bonus attacks, you'd see a much higher number in the columns where MH = OH speed.</div>

So, then it's mainly down to slow weapons being more beneficial for the new WW, <br>
threat being capped and rogues getting more effect out of the effective weapon speeds and haste. (since haste effects stack)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_521297"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Even with the Whirlwind change in 2.3, I doubt that many DW fury warriors will go for slow offhand, because a slow offhand is very unstable in terms of rage generation. 1-2 misses and you are facing rage starvation, causing loss of about 3K damage. Most of the current top tier fury warriors use about 220-250 hit rating, combined with 3% from talent, and you can clearly see, how often that offhand will miss.<br>
And yes, Heroic Strike is used a lot nowadays, even with the so-called "threat cap".<br>
The "threat cap" has been discussed in other thread here, and it has been shown that most fury warriors never reach that cap. It's an urban legend, something like the "perma flurry" legend, actually flurry is up about 70-80ish percent of the time, and fury warriors are indeed sometimes threat capped, but it's far from always.<br>
<br>
As a DW fury warrior I would greatly appreciate those babies. I will have somebody from the raid with alt warlock to SS me in front of the instance before a boss if I get them, so the "threat cap" won't be so much of an issue.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>This kind of statement is just completely baseless. You can't make class wide statements on threat like "a Fury Warrior would kill himself with those" without even offering anything to support it.<br>
<br>
Whether your DPS is threat capped or not is largely dependent on the tank - which is obviously going mean some variance between guilds.<br>
I'm sure I recall a post in another thread where a Warrior with the Warglaives in Quigon's guild said he had few problems because he was such a good tank.<br>
<br>
Our guild will be giving the Warglaives to the Rogues, because they have all been around since the guild charter was signed, where as both of our DPS warriors are new. It has nothing to do with how much each class can get out of it - if you have a good tank (and ignoring the 2.3 Whirlwind changes), I don't see any compelling reason to give them to Rogue's on principle aside from the justification which I just made.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">It was a sick DPS weapon, and rogues could handle the threat most of the time. I kinda wish they'd just scrap legendarys in total and replace them with normal epics that just look damned cool but are legendary in status (so the warglaives would look the same but be 100 DPS with a less sick proc). It would reduce the amount of whining about which classes get them, and let them be status symbols (see the other thread about status symbols). It would also let the drop rate be a bit higher, as at the moment it's a complete lottery - the whole Atiesh system was nice imo.</div>

</div>Warglaives drop quite frequently. It's not uncommon for a guild which has been killing Illidan for a while to have 4+ Warglaives.

It was a 5% drop rate or so, only slightly lower than either of the other two handers that could drop from Ragnaros. I know we got more Hands of Ragnaros than Untamed Blades, for instance (we got a lot more than was common though, but almost any guild that killed Ragnaros for a while would get an Eye of Sulfuras eventually).

				<div style="font-style:italic">Why? How does it not benefit every single person in your raid if your rogues are all sporting legendary weapons? Sure it means you have absolutely no chance to possibly catch up to them in dps, but so what?<br>
<br>
Legendaries ARE a status symbol, the issue does not lie in the fact that having them drop is counter productive and do not bring anything positive. The issue lies in the fact that a guild downing Illidan twice could conceivable get a full set, while the guild that has been farming Illidan for 3 months hasn't seen any yet.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Well I'd ask what positives the Warglaives have brought to the rogue class? Not long after WWS started surfacing with Warglaive wielding rogues doing 2600 dps and upwards that Blizzard introduced the WF nerf. Coincidence? I'd still also ask what positives it brought? Say there had never been legandary items and they were just an epic set of swords what would the downsides be? There are already so many valid loot concerns that throwing legendaries in for two of the most itemised classes doesn't really help the balance there. Now hunters are getting one, which fair enough they haven't had one before. But when your hunter has it its another warrior/rogue legendary.<br>
<br>
It also artifically changes class balance in raids. You're right, how awesome would it be if your 6 rogues all had 2x legendary. But then whats the reason to bring other DPS class again? Had the Hunter legandry been T6 instead of the Warglaives and boosted their DPS above rogues, that would be good how? Its all very well saying that anyone who questions this design philosophy is selfish but I just dont' see how adding powerful items that can change the class make up of a raid is a good thing. I also thought they'd swore off this kind of thing after Thunderfury and the complaints of it still being used in Tier 2.5/3 content. Certainly Atiesh wasn't such a powerful weapon for any class and made a small impact on the raid unlike Thunderfury which was huge. <br>
<br>
You seem contradictary on the matter. As you say its just dumb luck which guilds get them so I don't see how they can really be classed as a status symbol any more than Attumens mount could be. <br>

				Atiesh was done in a much better way. 40 items needed, not THAT uncommon of a drop, so any guild that puts the time in would get enough splinters to start the "meaty" of the quest. While drops like TF were so rare we farmed MC for a year and never  completed one, yet know 2 guilds that had 2, one of which completed a TF in their first ever MC clear to Domo. This is the problem, not legendaries in general. It should be something you can work towards, luck should only make it a bit faster, not decide entirely if you get it or not.

				I am really surprised so many people are posting that legendaries bring nothing positive to this game. Are people so selfish that the idea is "If I can't have it, why should you!" ? Do you not see the benefit of your melee DPS being able to put out even more dps? There has been rumour (confirmed now I believe?) of a hunter legendary comming out soonish, maybe in The Sunwell. Why would this be a problem for anyone? Sure, maybe you have 1 hunter in your raid... and? Now he hits harder. This is bad for everyone else...how?

</div>See above about 1 item altering your raid composistion. I don't believe things like this should affect your raid so drastically. Yes its great that they can put out more DPS but I don't see the benefit over having this set as just a purple set. New purple swords off him would still have allowed the melee to put out more DPS. <br>
<br>
Okay imagine the sunwell bow has "Increases physical damage done to the target by 1% for 10 seconds" when you strike them. That player now becomes totdally indispensible to the raid. You can't sub him out for anyone else because the increase of his one legendary weapon is so huge in terms of raid dps that even if he isn't performing to well his orange item means he can slack and still trounce your epic geared hutner in terms of DPS. <br>
<br>
Selfish? Maybe I am. Maybe I'd like to have 1 tier 6 weapon done well for my class before all the epics and now legendaries for other classes. But that would only make me human and I believe I can look past that in an impartial manner for the purposes of this discussion.<br>

</div>Again I'm going to have to disagree. Orange items are lore items that generally have a deep history in Warcraft's back story. Sticking two drops with none of this in on Illidan cheapens them in my opinion. I'd actually say that Blizzard needed to justify making them orange and failed to do so other than "To give the rogues some phat DPS and look cool".<br>
<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Warglaives drop quite frequently. It's not uncommon for a guild which has been killing Illidan for a while to have 4+ Warglaives. There's something like a 15% chance for either one of them to drop. Sulfuras also dropped fairly frequently, for the time at least. It was a 5% drop rate or so, only slightly lower than either of the other two handers that could drop from Ragnaros. I know we got more Hands of Ragnaros than Untamed Blades, for instance (we got a lot more than was common though, but almost any guild that killed Ragnaros for a while would get an Eye of Sulfuras eventually). As you've said already, Atiesh wasn't a lotto either, you just had to collect the splinters. Thunderfury has really been the only obscenely rare legendary thus far, with a 1-3% drop rate on two individual items of which you needed both to create the actual weapon.</div>

	</tbody></table>
</div>There's differences between the different type of weapons though. Thunderfury was just sickening in every regard for those that could use it well (threat/dps), but had a crap drop rate (1+half years of doing MC and I saw two bindings). Sulfuras was more of an e-peen/PvP weapon than anything else - DPS warriors could use it well in PvE but most of the time it went to people to show off/pvp with than as a useful item for PvE (all 3 eyes that I saw went to shamans). Atiesh was done well - it was the best in class and a useful item that provided a nice buff to the raid, without being over the top or ridiculously luck based to get it.<br>
<br>
The warglaives fall somewhere between Thunderfury (useful for PvE DPS and easily best in class even without the bonus) and Sulfuras (cool show-off weapon), however has none of the "crafting" system that any of the previous legendaries had, and is a complete lottery just like every other drop (and just like the Hand of Sulfuras/Thunderfury). The fact that Blizzard have completely disregarded the Atiesh system in favour of the previous drop system confuses me. <br>
<br>
My previous intent about legendaries was not that I wouldn't like to see them in the game - after all it's nice when the guild gets a status symbol to show that you've killed Illidan past some trinkets, but the Bulwark is just as recognisable a symbol and yet isn't legendary. I don't mind the legendary status of weapons or items, but making them both rare in a pure sense (like Atiesh - you couldn't get one Atiesh per clear because there just weren't enough bosses, no matter how good your luck compared to being able to get a legendary every Illidan kill) and more of a symbol than an actual weapon (i.e. epic stats, legendary status) so that it's maybe a minor upgrade (or even a sidegrade) but still looks cool, especially considering the homogenisation of everything that is currently going on (graphics for a set used for about 3 sets at a similar level, instead of differentiating things).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

It also artifically changes class balance in raids. You're right, how awesome would it be if your 6 rogues all had 2x legendary. But then whats the reason to bring other DPS class again? Had the Hunter legandry been T6 instead of the Warglaives and boosted their DPS above rogues, that would be good how?</div>

</div>Because they're legendaries... That is where their status comes from. They have either enhanced the individual player's abilities in some form (PVE DPS/Tanking for TF and warglaives,  PVP prowess for Sulfuras) or the raid's abilities (Atiesh). Otherwise what is the point? If you dont differentiate them, they're just purples... And personally, I really dislike the rampant homogenisation of the game that is currently occuring.<br>

</div> It will never happen. They've walked the line between amazing and gamebreaking very well so far. The person wearing the legendary (or the group with Atiesh) does, of course, achieve better DPS than the player (or group) without it... But as I stated earlier, that is the entire point. If the item does not provide some tangible improvement over the use of other weapons then they are no longer legendary and serve no purpose.<br>
<br>
The warlgaives were quite ridiculous in their original incarnation. Sure. But even Blizzard acknowledged this and altered them. They currently do not go anywhere near making or breaking your raid. I would not be afraid of sitting a player with warglaives because I suddenly lost the dps to kill bosses....I'd dare say they provide very little different a % boost to total raid dps than an Atiesh did for an appropriate DPS group in Naxxramas. And before anyone tries to demonstrate the difference in raid DPS between a guild with 3 warglaive sets and a guild with none, let me cut in and say that this is a problem of the system in place for attaining the items, and not the items themselves; who receives them is determined by the RNG and this can make some guilds kings and other guilds beggars (a poor system in my view)<br>

				Again I'm going to have to disagree. Orange items are lore items that generally have a deep history in Warcraft's back story. Sticking two drops with none of this in on Illidan cheapens them in my opinion. I'd actually say that Blizzard needed to justify making them orange and failed to do so other than "To give the rogues some phat DPS and look cool".

</div>I disagree with this sentiment. A lot. Personally, when I started this game I (foolishly) rolled a hunter in the hope that when hero classes were implemented, I could become a Demon Hunter. Why the DH? Warglaives. It was one of my favourite heroes in WC3 and whilst it was a solid hero to use, the art direction was what attracted me. I hoped that one day I'd be duel wielding some fucking bad ass looking weapons like those... Sad but true.<br>
<br>
Fast forward nearly 3 years and yes, tough shit, I picked the wrong class. But how many times has the artwork of the warglaives been used? Once. Where do they come from? Illidan.<br>
<br>
Every single person with any interest in the story behind this game KNOWS where they come from, who they belong to. To gain access to them, you have to pry them from the hands of the Betrayer himself (aka kill a boss and hope the RNG puts out this week). What more lore do you need? They're arguably the most recognisable weapons in the entire game. Show me art for Frostmourne and a Hungering Cold and I probably couldnt tell you which is which. And yet the warglaives are picked in an instant. (If you cant tell, personally, I dont give a shit about the lore, I just really like the art. And yet the art is a huge part of lore.)<br>

I would tend to agree, however, that dual warglaives are certainly more unique and recognizable than another two-handed sword with a skull between the grip and the business end.</div>

</div>I still think they're vastly superior to the Infamy/Savagery combo.  First off, the stats on the Warglaives add up to: <br>
+18dps<br>
+15agi<br>
+38sta<br>
+6hit<br>
+1crit<br>
-12attk<br>
(compared to the stats on Infamy/Savagery<br>
Secondly, the main-hand speed affects the attack modifier on SS from what I understand.  The slower the weapon, the higher the modifier.  That would make a 2.8 speed MH of the Warglaives receive a greater modifier than the 2.6 speed Blade of Infamy.<br>
<br>
Thirdly, even with the implemented ICD on the 2.3 test realm, I still find the set bonuses fantastic.</div>

		<div id="post_message_522604">Why I am not bothering with them (loot council, btw)<br>
<br>
1) Threat.  It's not much of a problem now, but there could be an important Sunwell encounter with threat wipes/etc that make the rogue more important.  <br>
<br>
2) Rewards.  I'm the only fury warrior and get to pick up most of random drop plate gear, and 3rd pieces of tanking gear.  We have 3 main rogues (and 1 backup) already competing for loot.  <br>
<br>
3) Drama.  There's enough interest in these things that I don't want to deal with it.<br>
<br>
4) Weapon speed.  A 2.8 speed weapon MH and fast OH means much more to a rogue than to a warrior.<br>
<br>
5) Sharing epeen.  I got the bug mount from AQ and don't want to be a legendary whore =)<br>
<br>
There are of obvious objective reasons in favor of a rogue, but subjectively--friendship matters.  Ideally we are friends with our guildies and don't want to be an asses about loot that drops after you've already beaten the game.  If there is a well deserving warrior who wants this item, I think it should be considered.</div>

</div>Are you hinting that druids should get warglaives!!! Kidding, but come on, you're getting weepy over a nerf(which may or may not be warranted), that constitutes a small-to-medium loss in DPS for either of the two classes that uses it. The stats, damage range, and set-proc are all better than the alternatives (though KT scepter proc is tight as hell), and they will remain the best DW option for either class. Period. Yes they might not be as "legendary" as they previously were, with rogues capping 3k sustained dps, but it's honestly not worth getting raged over. I think that if you have 'em, they're still the best, and if you don't? They're still the best, but the upgrade isn't as significant (just Bearly).<br>
<br>
*Edit* Zerix you have the <i>best</i> rogue gear in the game, I know nerfs suck, but is it really going to affect your (likely) #1 dps spot?</div>

Also, if you ask me Dragonspine and the Warglaive proc were what got melee haste nerfed altogether in the first goddamn place and now, even after a targetted nerf to each of them, they are still best in class items.</div>

</div>Of course I'll still be #1 damage, but the margin is slowly but surely getting smaller and smaller with the little nerfs here and there.<br>
<br>
1) WindFury nerf - Needed for pvp balance, whatever i'll take it.<br>
2) Haste nerf - Not needed (caster haste should have been buffed, and it was rightfully so)<br>
3) DST nerf - Needed, the ICD on this is fine I think<br>
4) Warglaive nerf - Not needed, if they nerfed it at all, put it on the same 20 second-ish ICD as Dragonspine<br>
5) Incoming totem twist nerf - Whatever, this needs to be fixed, it was never intended.<br>
<br>
I just ask myself, well what next?  Given the fact that I am somewhat used to them by now, taking something that can chain proc off itself (like oldschool dst), to a 45 second to 1 minute internal cooldown (like tsunami, etc) is that really fair?  Like was the haste and dst nerf not enough already?<br>
<br>
It's really history repeating itself if you look at them the same way as thunderfury.<br>
<br>
- A cool legendary weapon is great in its initial form, a little overpowered but hey, its above and epic quality item, it has that right.  Only a handful of people experienced the un-nerfed version of thunderfury where it could chain proc off itself.<br>
- A lot of people get thunderfury now and open their mouths about how overpowered the proc is, resulting in the nerf.<br>
<br>
Same thing happened.  3000dps is now a thing of the past and probably wont happen again until lvl 80 raiding.  I don't see sunwell items giving me another 500-600dps from what I have now.<br>
<br>
Oh well though.  Sorry for getting somewhat off the subject.</div>

</div>Individually, yes, but it is a higher chance to get one overall.  The way it probably works since it is an extra loot slot and we can probably assume both cannot drop on the same kill is that the extra slot has say 15% chance to drop.  After it is determined that a glaive will drop it rolls 50/50 to determine which one, resulting in a lower droprate per blade, but a higher droprate overall.</div>

		<div id="post_message_523378">Personally, I think Blizzard probably should have gone with something where Illidan dropped a "damaged" Warglaive of Azzinoth that requires doing something for a smithing NPC to get fixed up, to keep with the protocol of legendaries requiring some effort outside the basics. But, I can see why droppable legendaries make sense from Illidan -- he <b>is</b> much more significant to the lore of Warcraft than Ragnaros was -- and the reason they aren't incredibly "overpowered" like TF was is probably due to the fact that they <b>are</b> droppable and don't require an outside time/money investment. They are still certainly cool as hell and as an enhancement shaman I will never get to wear them, so I'd say you're pretty lucky overall.</div>

<br>
As to the comment about aggro making a huge difference - not so much, and I don't at all agree that guilds are, or at least should, not be giving the MT a totem.  Giving the MT a totem should increase raid dps more than any other spot, as aggro limitations should be there when you have legendaries in play.  MT benefits hugely from a shaman in nearly every fight.<br>
<br>
I'd also agree with Zerix that they'll be overnerfed in 2.3, they're borderline epic/legendary - but who cares at this point, game has been beaten, and nothing new for a long, long, long time.</div>

		<div id="post_message_523475">I'd say what it ultimately comes down to is; <br>
How could they even justify the coloring of <b>Illidan Stormrage</b>'s blades merely as purple? Regardless of stats, droprate &amp; lore... Those Warglaives are 2 of the most influential weapons of WarCraft History. Trace back through the WarCraft universe and consider the number of Illidans enemies whom of which were slain by those very weapons. That's legendary enough - before considering that this entire expansion revolves around Illidan. <br>
<br>
It's not just some sword that dropped from some random one-time boss by the name of "Mother Shahraz"; who incidentally looks the same as every other mob of her kind. This is the death of one of WarCraft's most monumental &amp; loved characters. Having the Warglaives drop as Epics would be a proverbial slap in the face. :P<br>
<br>
Whilst I disagree with the distribution of his weapons ("Illidan is dead - here, have his weapons"), is there really any other way to do it? They'd be beating a dead and buried horse if they were to give you a "broken" weapon (which Illidan was incidentally wielding moments earlier), which then required you to collect a stack of materials &amp; complete a series of quests to "restore". Besides, Ashbringer is on it's way in WotLK and also appears to follow the latter trend.</div>

Hell, does Nihilum? One guilds raids will output an extra what, 1000 or so dps over another guilds because they were lucky enough to loot 3 sets of blades? Sounds fair.<br>
<br>
When an item is as powerful as the Twin Blades are(were, once 2.3 hits?) it transcends the normal RNG screwage that every guild has to put up with for some particular item or items. The real question is why the hell didn't they stick with the Atiesh model for attaining legendary weapons? Not frustrating enough?</div>

		<div id="post_message_523567">The answer should be obvious by the immense number of poor decisions made in Burning Crusade: the people that created Naxx are either gone or forgotten and the show is run by less than stellar people instead. Other than a few exceptions, raiding in BC has been poor and unimaginative.<br>
I also disagree that things should not be able to proc off themselves, I dislike the entire "internal global cooldown" thing since it disallows you to increase your output by selecting your gear based on synergy with it. I do however think that the proc rate and effect should be balanced to foresee this happening. Same with MSD for mages and DST earlier. Degenerate combinations of items are fun, as long as they are not affected pvp (I guess), and there is nothing more enjoyable than exploring all kinds of brokenness to increase your (dps) output.<br>
<br>
In fact, it is something that I find very much lacking in wow, and I would much rather ways where you can increase your raw output by a proper choice of skills and gear than by walking in line and wearing exactly the same junk as the person next to you. I'm not talking about 3000 dps obviously, this should not be allowed, but if someone "breaks" the game, then a difference of 10-20 % should be acceptable.</div>

<br>
As currently implemented, I suppose I favor the Warglaives getting nerfed.  After all, there's nothing in TBC raiding that's a huge upgrade from anything else.  Moving from a Karazhan mace to the Illidan mace didn't have a huge impact on my performance, why should upgrading from T6 swords to different-colored T6 swords have that kind of impact?  I actually think that Legendaries SHOULD be enormous upgrades that provide benefits unmatched by anything else in the game.  I'd be fine with that if they were like Atiesh.  Atiesh was the ultimate symbol of raid success, an incredible group accomplishment...not a low-% drop that tripled the eBay value of the recipient's character.  So in the context of TBC raiding, it makes sense that everything be homogenized and the gear-progression curve be flattened.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Yes, having them on a rogue is a better increase in raid dps, but after the ICD goes live the weapons arent THAT much better than other BT/Hyjal epics, so you can make a convincing arguement for both sides.<br>

</div>The same lore excuse could have been made for the Warglaives, or any of the other legendary weapons.  Sulfuras was just a lump of ore.  TF was reforged from two "bindings".  And Atiesh was rebuilt from splinters.  It doesn't seem unreasonable that the Skull of Gul'dan, an item so powerful that it was the focus of an entire mission in War3 (it also appeared in War2X), could be considered legendary in quality.  It could have at least had a quest to restore/cleanse/etc it into a usable tool.  Maybe it's just the bias I have from playing a caster, but I'm personally a bit disappointed to see yet another melee only legendary, with at least one more in the pipe (Ashbringer).  It would've been nice to see the Skull of Guldan and maybe the Memento of Tyrande as legendaries as well.  All three (or four, if you want to count the Warglaives as two) could've had some fun lore quests attached to craft the item and learn a bit about it's story.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">EJ has no Warglaives.  Mementos of Tyrande are just as good.  But yeah, the way they've implemented Legendaries has always galled me.  <br>
<br>
As currently implemented, I suppose I favor the Warglaives getting nerfed.  After all, there's nothing in TBC raiding that's a huge upgrade from anything else.  Moving from a Karazhan mace to the Illidan mace didn't have a huge impact on my performance, why should upgrading from T6 swords to different-colored T6 swords have that kind of impact?  I actually think that Legendaries SHOULD be enormous upgrades that provide benefits unmatched by anything else in the game.  I'd be fine with that if they were like Atiesh.  Atiesh was the ultimate symbol of raid success, an incredible group accomplishment...not a low-% drop that tripled the eBay value of the recipient's character.  So in the context of TBC raiding, it makes sense that everything be homogenized and the gear-progression curve be flattened.</div>

</div>My opinion is also from a guild whom has not seen a warglaive in 10 illidan kills so I may seem a little bitter, however I agree with this statement the most.  I think the nerf on the warglaives were needed just because of the sheer randomness of getting them.  The guild that has killed Illidan the most times still has no warglaives yet guilds that have killed him half as many have 2 pairs?  Pre nerf a single pair of warglaives increased your raid dps by (just throwing out a number) say 500?  That is a pretty big advantage going into new content, when guilds are racing for world firsts and the randomness of a drop could make or break if you make an enrage timer.  Nerfing them down was necessary, I would be upset if I owned them too but you have to look at how it balances the game.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Not entirely true - Atiesh looked pretty basic as a static screenshot, but the actual staff itself created extra effects on the character (Crows flying round them, for example). It may not have had the instant "whoa what's that giant glowy thing" effect, but it still looked cool overall (kind of like a screenshot of the warlock t6, doesn't look that amazing unless you capture it with the wing animation going). It also had to look like that to fit in with the lore (although saying that, I'm pretty sure the warglaives weren't bright green, but I assume that's supposed to be a carry over of the power of Gul'dan/whatever).<br>
<br>
Atiesh was also a good system in that no-one ever whined about it. If you were good enough to do the content, you would get one eventually, which just isn't true about the rest of the legendaries currently in the game. The difference in power is also a bit different - sulfuras, the warglaives and thunderfury are all purely individual weapons (reliance on procs for extra power above the standard increase in DPS/stats), while Atiesh is a very group-oriented weapon for it's extra power (aura), yet is still in line with the other weapons in overall power, other than the original Thunderfury. Echoing Sebudai, I am wondering why the hell they didn't learn after 2 years of Legendary drama and then the success that Atiesh turned out to be.<br>
<br>
To whoever it was who said that the drop % was 15% - Blizzard's tooltip shows 3-14% on armory, and Wowhead shows a drop% of 2% and 4% for the offhand and mainhand. It's probably around 5% total - not something that anyone can ever "expect" to get. According to Wowhead, the drop rate for the Gurtogg tanking trinket (<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32501" target="_blank">[Shadowmoon Insignia]</a>) is ~18%, and the Council trinket (<a class="q4" style="text-decoration: none; font-weight: bold;" href="https://tbc.wowhead.com/?item=32505" target="_blank">[Madness of the Betrayer]</a>) is 28%. At a guess, I'd put them as about 20% drop rate each (wowhead can never be taken as accurate) and yet we haven't seen a single one of either, in over 3 months of clearing Illidan. Having a purely RNG system on such an "important" item is just ridiculous - Thunderfury showed that long ago.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I wonder if this is due totally to the fact that they aren't restricted to a single class. How about if there was, say, a hunter only Legendary. It only dropped for them, and only they could use it. A mage only one. A Priest only one. <br>
<br>
A lot of the drama that I've seen come from legendaries is over who can "use it best". The rogue or the warrior (as they are the two classes that have the most legendaries in the game). So simply seperating that, making them for a single class only, should take a lot of the drama out of it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I know I may be quoting something abit off topic, but I've been hearing this way too often lately.<br>
<br>
In my opinion, the only reason Kungen used TF is because 'he can'. Because it looks cool. He's loosing out on quite some extra TPS by doing so aswell.<br>
<br>
We recently had someone suggest to go back to MC and farm TF 'because it can't be bad since Kungen is still using it'. It took me 2 nights to convince our MT back in the day that he shouldnt aim to stack block rating just because Kungen was running around with 30% block rating.<br>
I've seen tons of people who have been farming BT with horrible gem/gear choices.<br>
<br>
Blizzard should stop shooting themselves in the foot with items like these. TF was so overpowered they actually adjusted warrior talents (which makes me think they may have modeled Naxx boss DPS around the TF debuff. They could have just nerfed the proc aswell) to compensate.<br>
<br>
They nerfed haste rating because of DST/Warglaives/Dragonstrike, making a possible interesting mechanic redundant, instead of just changing those procs.<br>
<br>
Im actually wondering why Blizzard keeps handling Legendaries so badly. Atiesh was perfect, RNG isnt.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>As much as I agree with you wholeheartedly; we need to be mindful that this entire expansion was based around Illidan. There's been a lot of build up since the day we first heard from Malfurion that his brother was alive and driven mad in his Outland fortress. I always kind of assumed that Illidan was supposed to last until the end of this expansion; and that no further content would be implemented. <br>
<br>
It seems to me that people progressed further and faster than Blizzard had anticipated, and thus a rush for additional content to tide people over until WotLK. When a multi-million dollar product is based around a single character; it's only expected that his weapons would be legendary. Though as someone mentioned earlier; it'd make just as much sense for the Skull &amp; Memento to also be legendary. I guess the argument against that would be that they couldn't justify flooding the game with a bunch of Legendaries based on their lore value.<br>
<br>
As WotLK will revolve around Arthas; it's just as rational to assume that Frostmourne will also be Legendary. (We've all seen the "Hail to the King, baby" screenshot from Blizzcon)<br>
<br>
I guess a token system would be the best method of "legendary distribution"; whereby a single token starts a range of different class-specific quests resulting in an appropriate reward for each class. But once again... that would result in flooding the game with legendaries, and somewhat "cheapening" their value. (If it hasn't already reached this point?)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I don't foresee a flood of Legendaries with this idea, but one heck of a storm of drama. Can you possibly imagine the sort of...ah...issues that a guild would get into, if there was a single token that you could use to get a very good legendary for any spec of every class...and EVERYONE in the raid could stake a legitimate claim to it? I recall some of the drama over Atiesh, and that was only 4 classes, and not a spec specific item. Something like this would do way more harm than good, I think. <br>
<br>
Which is why I suggested such a token, and such spec specific things, but on a class only token. Say...Kael drops the priest epic token. Archimonde the hunter one. Illidan the rogue one, etc. <br>
<br>
Though in that case, I suppose you'd end up with guilds arguing about which Legendary to go for, this week.</div>

</div>According to the lore, Illidan drained the Skull's power, so I would assume that's why it's only epic (no longer that powerful). Would have been cooler as an offhand, though.</div>

</div>I like to call it Random Number Garbage. But that's a topic for another thread. <br>
<br>
Honestly, while these weapons are a significant upgrade for any guild, and I myself would love a chance to have them (~10 Illidan kills and no drops yet) I don't think they are going to make or break a cutting edge guild's chance to grab a world first. Sure the extra dps is nice, but in today's raiding game there are so many other factors that are thrown at you that dps is usually the last thing you concentrate on when learning an encounter, especially one like Archimonde.<br>
<br>
As far as rogue vs. warrior...they by no means are wasted on a warrior, but a good rogue can get a little more mileage out of them without having to resort to a 100% guaranteed soulstone agro wipe. <br>
<br>
One other point, while everyone was pointing to Furi and his 2k and 2.5k+ dps on some encounters after he got his set (and I'm sure this was a significant factor in getting haste nerfed) the rest of us without those were able to push 2k dps with the right group makeup. What many people mistake as "warglaive hate" is actually an overall bias against rogues amongst the non-hardcore WoW population. Not to derail this thread, but I think it's topic touches on a sore subject among many. People generally don't like rogues, prompted, I think, primarily from getting "ganked" in pvp.<br>
<br>
I don't think the warglaive's were necessarily overpowered, they just happened to be "most useful" to an "unpopular" class. Like it or not, Blizzard does seem to listen to the "general pop" and make adjustments based on their gripes.<br>
<br>
And yes, I realize that I used " way too often in this "post".</div>

Maybe. <br>
<br>
However, and maybe I'm biased, but I don't recall as much outrage directed at mages and warlocks when most of us were in Gruuls/SSC and the crafting sets came out that pumped their damage up significantly. I can recall sitting out on raids because mages dps was significantly higher than rogues and they were less trouble (on the whole) to keep alive. <br>
<br>
When the pendulum began to swing the other way in BT people started screaming about rogue damage. It became worse when the glaives entered the equation and shortly afterward haste rating was nerfed, along with the ICD being added to DST and the warglaives. To this day I don't recall there ever being a nerf on the crafted cloth sets. <br>
<br>
Maybe it's the difference between an interim set piece and an endgame piece, I don't know, but it does smack as a bit of hypocrisy for casters at the time to say "the crafted pieces are fine, l2p" then scream bloody murder when rogues were topping the meters again. I would argue that those pieces were as overpowered as the warglaives were pre-nerf, but again, I'm a rogue so I'm sure that's a bit of bitterness from having to sit out on some raids because of this in the past.</div>

		<div id="post_message_535071">I think most rational people would be willing to agree that the cloth sets were itemized too well for the effort involved in getting them, especially when compared to equivalent tier drops through tier 5 when stat allocation and survivability wasn't a big deal. I don't see how you can compare it to the Warglaives though. They weren't directly targeted for nerfs, I'd blame Dragonspine trophy and the piles of haste gear that was giving significantly larger gains to rogues than anything casters could ever have crafted. To that end, I don't think Blizzard realized how significant haste would be for rogues when stacked passively on top of items like DST. A good caster comparison would be the adjustment of TLC and MSD to balance out a recent Mage flavor spec.<br>
<br>
All that being said, good rogues top the DM without glaives so the "cloth sets vs warglaives" argument strikes me as a bit odd when you're referencing it as one side thinking the other needs to "l2p".</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I think most people would be willing to agree that the cloth sets were itemized too well for the effort involved in getting them, especially when compared to equivalent tier drops through tier 5 when stat allocation and survivability wasn't a big deal. I don't see how you can compare it to the Warglaives though. They weren't directly targeted for nerfs, I'd blame Dragonspine trophy and the piles of haste gear that was giving significantly larger gains to rogues than anything casters could ever have crafted. To that end, I don't think Blizzard realized how significant haste would be for rogues when stacked passively on top of items like DST. A good caster comparison would be the adjustment of TLC and MSD to balance out a recent Mage flavor spec.<br>
<br>
All that being said, good rogues top the DM without glaives so the "cloth sets vs warglaives" argument strikes me as a bit odd when you're referencing it as one side thinking the other needs to "l2p".</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>I think you misunderstand me. As of right now, with BT being actively run by many of us, there isn't an issue with the crafted sets and rogues without warglaives ARE able to top the meters on the majority of fights in BT and Hyjal. The "l2p" statement was an attempt at humor, and not indicative of the attitude shown on these boards, but more what the general WoW forum user would use. <br>
<br>
What I was referring to was pre-TK when (and I'm speaking from personal experience, so take it with a grain of salt) the caster crafted sets came out that were arguably overpowered in relation to where most guilds were at that time. Casters were consistently out dps-ing rogues and fury warriors. Then they "buffed" (or bugged) windfury and sword spec, which boosted melee dps a little, but a caster in a full set of crafted was still outperforming melee in partial T4. This remained somewhat true up through SSC and into TK when the melee began to pick up the gear they needed to compete, from a damage perspective. My point was that at the time the crafted sets came out they were "arguably" overpowered in relation to the level of the melee, at least for most of the guilds that weren't on the extreme cutting edge. There was discussion about those sets and how good they were, and there were rogues complaining that they were losing spots to mages and warlocks in raids because of them. <br>
<br>
It's all about perspective. When the casters were topping the meters, the general consensus was that rogues bitching was unjustified, and that "rogues have been topping the meters for so long, it's someone else's turn". While that's a bit of a generalization, there wasn't ever an effort (that we know of ) by Blizzard to correct this imbalance. Granted, it was a temporary one that was "fixed" once melee started getting drops in BT and Hyjal (and to a lesser extent, TK), but as soon as the melee began topping the meters once again with a stacked group we saw changes to windfury and sword spec, and later the haste, dst, and warglaive nerf.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying the melee pieces weren't overpowered, I'm simply pointing out that there does seem to be a negative bias towards melee (specifically rogues) and I'm using the crafted sets vs melee items to illustrate my point. It might not be the best illustration due to the temporary nature of the crafted sets "overpowered-ness", but looking at the lack of an adjustment to them at the time they were introduced to the swiftness with which melee items have been adjusted and the associated volume of complaints of one vs. the other, leads me to the conclusion that there is indeed a bias at play. <br>
<br>
Let me conclude with saying that I don't really see that bias on these boards. While I'm sure there are some from Blizzard who read the posts here, I don't doubt that they pay more attention to their own boards and react accordingly.</div>

</div>You are right, I recall that now, thanks for bringing it up.<br>
<br>
There were a lot of us who said nerf the warglaives and the dst, but leave haste rating alone, but that change went through. I've been dumping haste items and picking up the offset pieces that I passed on to other people in the past (including one vash belt that ended up going to a hunter because I had the one off Akama), so I was particularly interested in that change. I used to run 211 hit with 15% or so static haste and found it was roughly equivalent to having capped hit. It was nice to be able to pick up alternate pieces and ease contention for certain items, but that went out the window when they made this change.</div>

</div>No, not complaining, simply using it as an illustration. <br>
<br>
Also, not every level 70 epic got buffed. There was no change to BT/Hyjal epic items, unless I missed a patch note somewhere.<br>
<br>
Edit - I'm thinking weapons, some of the items might have gotten a buff, so I apologize if my statement is in error. Vash/KT weapons got buffed to almost the same dps as the ones from BT and Hyjal, while the higher level items got no dps upgrade (yet). You are probably correct in that the ilevel changed, but being a biased rogue (no sarcasm intended) I'm more concerned in actual dps increasing stats and mostly concerned with dps upgrades on weapons, so I probably overlooked/forgot about the change you are referring to since it had little effect on me. Perspective strikes once again.</div>

		<div id="post_message_535182">Giving melee significant damage boosts of their own is tricky because melee DPS benefit from more group synergy than anyone else in the game.  Feral Druids, Hunters, Warriors, Shamans, Paladins, Warlocks (Recklessness)...nearly every class that can confer a group buff can increase melee DPS.  The synergy options for casters aren't nearly as comprehensive or appealing.  So yes, I think that if you are looking to keep things balanced you need to err on the side of keeping a lone melee character's DPS low...because you have to assume as a dev that they'll be taking advantage of a ton of synergy options.  <br>
<br>
A Mage's Frostbolt is boosted by what...Curse of Elements, Misery, Wrath of Air and maybe Totem of Wrath?   Every swing of a Rogue's weapons (white or yellow) is boosted in a typical raid situation by Battle Shout, Sunder Armor, Leader of the Pack, Strength of Earth, Hunter's Mark, Expose Weakness, Curse of Recklessness, Windfury Weapon (a proc, but it scales with gear so let's treat it passively), Unleashed Rage, Blessing of Might and Blessing of Kings.  Any new gear a Rogue gets has its effect multiplied to a far greater extent than any upgrade a caster gets.  For this reason, an ENORMOUS upgrade like the Warglaives becomes simply ludicrous in an ideal raid situation (which as I've said is what the devs are forced to balance around).<br>
<br>
I know you're trying not to be alarmist or go over the top in your claim of "bias"...but honestly, think about what you're saying.  Why on God's green Earth would the devs have an intrinsic emotional "bias" against melee classes?  It's just silly.<br>
<br>
addition: Melee haste rating was nerfed to be brought into line with caster haste rating.  Rating of any kind occupies the same item budget point-for-point, so the huge discrepancy between the effectiveness of melee haste and spell haste meant that the spell haste items were largely worthless.  Evening it out just made sense from an itemization standpoint, because the old situation effectively robbed item levels from any caster who used spell haste gear.<br>
<br>
Also, I see no mention of the Fireball/Frostbolt tax, which was simply a massive nerf to casters early in TBC that is reversed only in 2.3.</div>

		<div id="post_message_535192">Ghando...not devs, general wow population. Which will, to some extent, influence the devs to make adjustments.<br>
<br>
In this case, sooner with the rogue changes (which I'll admit needed to be made to a certain extent) and later with caster changes. <br>
<br>
Is this true every time? No, but it seems to be happening a fair amount lately. <br>
<br>
Look at it this way, you have a lot of paying customers that are bitching about something, won't that prompt you to, in some cases, over-scrutinize or react? I'm only pointing out that I think this has occurred recently in a couple of cases.<br>
<br>
Edit - yes, the damage tax on mages was poorly thought out, imo, and should have been changed long ago. I think the problem there stemmed from it mainly affecting one casting class. Had this been an issue with mages and warlocks both, I think it would have been changed sooner. Purely speculation on my part.<br>
<br>
I think I derailed this thread enough, I didn't mean to start a whole side topic on anti-rogue (or melee) bias, though I do think the game is designed to be more caster centric lately. Purely my own opinion, take it for what it's worth. Hell, I've been playing for a couple of years now with no plans to quit, so they must be doing something right.</div>

Second, even if I accept what you're saying how do the Warglaives factor in?  Only a tiny minority of the playerbase has even SEEN a Warglaive, let alone gotten hit with/ganked by one.  Maybe they saw a WWS of Blood Legion Rogues putting up huge numbers, but do they really understand it?  Doubtful, and I'd think the devs realize that.

Yes, there are a lot of "nerf warlock" posts, mostly in regards to pvp from what I've seen, which is subject to bias and perspective. <br>
<br>
I didn't say the warglaive nerf was a direct result of anti-rogue bias. My point was (and it's subjective - I'll be the first to admit that) that amongst the pve, general wow community, when melee classes, specifically rogues, moved from a position of being either slightly sub-par or on-par with casting casting class damage to a position of clear superiority there was more of an outcry and a faster response than when the reverse happened. That point is open to debate, I could be wrong, it's purely from my perspective and what I saw within my own guild and perusing the WoW forums.</div>

</div>OK, I'll bite. I think you're engaging in selective grandstanding in order to promulgate an overly simplistic view of how classes scale from solo to raid play.<br>
<br>
To name the largest elephant in the room - boss armor values are far higher than armor values on lower level mobs in 5-man instances and/or outdoors. Half the buffs you name are necessary simply to get past this.<br>
<br>
To name the second elephant in the room - a caster benefits immeasurably from being in a group because they have a tank. They are able to cast their damaging spells uninterrupted in a way that is just not possible in solo play. In solo play, depending on classes, you spend many of your spell casts on frost novas, blinks, fears and other control measures. Allowing you to stand and nuke benefits you massively, and there is no equivalent boost for melee. The only benefit a melee class has is the lack of parries if they're attacking from behind. In solo play, the mobs you fight have a parry of around 5%, no more.<br>
<br>
Even discounting the effect of these two gigantic elephants, you are miscounting buffs.<br>
<br>
You should certainly count the improved scorch or Winter's Chill debuffs as plusses on the caster side: these two have nothing like as large an effect in shorter fights with small numbers of casters. Not to mention that a solo warlock won't benefit from the effects of Improved Scorch!<br>
<br>
Also take BoK - you've counted it on the melee side, but not on the caster side. This is wrong. While it doesn't directly affect your +damage unless you have Arcane Mind, it increases your mana pool and any return you get from mage armor / arcane meditation. More mana translates to more damage, since it allows you to use higher DPS, less mana efficient spell choices.<br>
<br>
Finally, while it may be true that the <i>number</i> of raid synergies affecting casters is lower than that for melee, this means nothing unless you also look at the <i>magnitude</i> of the individual synergies. Misery is a flat percentage boost to all your damage. Likewise for Shadow weaving and other suchlike talents. The warlock / shadowpriest interaction is the sickest set of synergies in the game, period.<br>
<br>
<br>
You may object that I've focused on caster classes as a whole, rather than on your specific example of a frostbolt. To that, I would counter that complaining that frost is not a raid-optimal tree is true "Well duh" material.</div>

</div>That's an overly simplistic view. Firespec uses its highest DPS rotation all the time and never ever runs into mana issues because shadow priests are <i>that</i> good. As arcane spec (AM, putting AB aside), I also run my highest DPS rotation, without having mana issues (due to shadow priest or jow).<br>
<br>
You can argue that without a shadow priest and jow and BOW I would run into mana issues in most fights, which is true. But <i>regardless</i> whether or not I have mana issues, I am unlikely to change my DPS rotation from my highest DPS rotation. The only net impact of having less mana is that I have a hard cap on the duration I can sustain my DPS. Currently, I have never ran into a fight where I ended up fully OOM except shahraz pre-nerf.<br>
<br>
In other words, for all intent and purpose, more mana never equalled more DPS if you don't run into mana issues in the first place.</div>

		<div id="post_message_535308">Hmm, perhaps. But shouldn't you be able to switch to AB spam as a final mana dump? If so, then having more mana allows you to go in to AB spam mode sooner. Or is your highest DPS rotation actually higher than AB spam? It may only be a few percent (or tenths of a percent) extra DPS, but it's not actually zero. <br>
<br>
Note also that Ghando didn't include shadow priest mana regen as an example of class synergy, or Blessing of Wisdom, or Judgement of Wisdom. Now, if you go into pretty much any raid boss fight with <i>no</i> additional mana regen from these and similar synergies, then you certainly will have mana problems and not be able to do full DPS<br>
<br>
But to focus on the specific example of mana regen is to miss the point of my point, which is that a simple numerical reckoning up of buffs is the wrong analysis to perform.<br>
<br>
How much DPS do you put out while solo grinding? How much do you put out in a 5-man party? How much under raid conditions? Is the ratio of your raid:solo DPS more or less than the ratio for a melee class in similar ilvl gear, and by how much? That's the question to look at, not some random and inevitably subjective listing of particular synergies while ignoring all the other differences between casters and melee.</div>

		<div id="post_message_535330">I intentionally left out AB spam. The problem with AB spam is that you need 2pct5 (which means no 4pct6 +5% AM/fireball dmg). As you can imagine, it is not interesting. Technically you can reach 2000 DPS from pure perfect case AB spam, but for that you need to gear considerably differently than AM spam (which is your main nuke no matter how you look at it). AM spam is around 1850 DPS for less than half the mana cost of AB spam. Now keep in mind, you simply cannot sustain AB spam for more than 1:20-1:30, and thats using a shadow priest, JOW, 2pct6 evocation, gems and the best mana potions. AB spam is simply unusable under any realistic scenario.</div>

		<div id="post_message_535431">I didn't include the mana buffs for the precise reason that Manly describes.  In no way do they result in higher DPS, just more longevity.  Melee classes inherently have infinite longevity, so VT etc. just evens that particular playing field and prevents the situation where the caster goes OOM and does no damage.  AB spam as a final dump doesn't make sense as a Fire spec because of Molten Fury.  And I didn't count Winters Chill etc. because it's a buff the class gives itself.  Similarly, I didn't list Hemorrhage or Find Weakness or Expose Armor as potential Rogue buffs though they'd certainly increase DPS if present.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry that I didn't do enough math to please you, but while a listing of buffs is not mathematically precise it conveys the general idea which I think is absolutely legitimate...that far more melee buffs/synergies are available and they absolutely have a larger impact than caster synergies. My intention is to point this out, not to quantify it.  Is anyone honestly claiming that caster DPS benefits from as much or more group synergy than melee DPS?  Because all I see is nitpicking about methods.</div>

		<div id="post_message_535488">Another thing is that there has rarely been a single item (we'll treat a Warglaive pair as a single unit, since there's not a tremendous difference with only one) that made such a huge difference in damage for ANY class.  Sulfuras was a great weapon, but it was quickly eclipsed by Ashkandi and Mace Spec was crappy.  Atiesh was the best caster weapon in the game, but caster classes don't benefit as much from weapon-slot upgrades as melee (makes sense since the weapon slot is just stats for a caster) and half the point of the staff was its party-wide passive aura.  Only Thunderfury gave the sort of jaw-dropping boost the Warglaives do, whether it was on a tank or melee DPS.  And what do Thunderfury and the Warglaives have in common?  They were both heavily nerfed once it became clear what was possible with them.</div>

</div>Every class whines on it's own boards about impending nerfs to their class or buffs to another class. <br>
<br>
I do recall a very lengthy thread on the wow raid forums where someone posted a WWS link to a fight where Furi topped out over 2k dps (maybe it was 2.5k) that generated quite a bit of uproar. It wasn't long after this that they hotpatched windfury (which hurt arms warriors probably the worst) and announced changes to haste, sword spec, dst and the glaives.<br>
<br>
I don't recall the same happening when the caster sets came out, though I do remember some people complaining about them and I saw the increase in damage the casters in Fusion did compared to the melee. They announced a nerf to these and there <b>was</b> a lot of outrage in response to that. So much so that they backed off and never instituted it. <br>
<br>
It's all perspective. We don't all see the same things from our point of view and it's colored by our own perceptions to a varying degree. I happen to think there is validity to my position, others may disagree, and that's fine. Were the warglaives overpowered? Probably, and they probably needed a nerf. Not having them I can't speak authoritatively on that, I can only make a semi-educated guess based on the numbers I've seen from parses. I would be curious to see if any warriors were able to put up fantastic numbers with these pre-nerf, and if not, why. This might be a topic of discussion more in line with the originator's intent of this post instead of a derailment into the differing aspects of melee dps vs. caster dps and our individual perceptions of the two.<br>
<br>
Are rogue raid spots in trouble due to the haste, dst, and warglaive nerf? Not in a guild that's farming BT/Hyjal. Since that's the category I fall into that's the only one I'm going to comment on. <br>
<br>
I do want to make one final point in regards to the synergy between melee dps and the buffs available to them. It's a two edged sword. Because I, as a rogue, gain so much from the available buffs, in order to do the best I can do and pump out the most dps I can (which is pretty much my only function within the current raiding environment if you discount kicking on RoS and Council) I absolutely MUST have all the buffs available to do my job. I'd much rather have higher individual dps and be less dependent on others to do top dps than the way it is currently. Solo in SMV I can do between 700 and 900 dps without using cooldowns. Blowing cooldowns I can burst up to 1300 or so for a very short period of time. Fully buffed with an enhance shaman in group, warrior and a feral druid I can sustain 1700 on most boss fights and pull upwards of 1900 or so if I get a good run. We are talking more than double my solo damage due to being in the right group. I'd rather do more solo dps and be less reliant on others to perform at my best.</div>

That's true. The idea of hybrids buffs works as long as you get the perfect setup in raids. If you run with 4 rogues, a feral, a fury warrior and an enhancement, like we do normally, 2 of those are cursed to do lower dps than what their class is capable of.<br>
<br>
Which makes me go back to whining about the concept of groups of 5 instead of 6 unlike almost every other MMO out there. If anything, one of the wishes i have as raid leader is that they increase the group slots to 6, or the concept of cross class buffs will not work efficiently.</div>

		<div id="post_message_537213">An innate bias against rogues?  That's completely you being emotional and having a completely skewed point of view.<br>
<br>
Any rational caster denounced the tailoring sets as being completely overpowered and requiring nerfs, look at my very old posts, I did because they were and are still too good.  I still wear my full FSW and my guild just killed Archimonde, and I replaced spellstrike only after we killed Vashj.<br>
<br>
It is a lot more important to be extremly powerful in the endgame than to be extremly powerful levelling up or in mid-tier raids.  Every single min/maxer would rather choose a class that sucked in mid-level raids but dominated high end raids.<br>
<br>
Rogues were targetted for nerfs since the high end damage that melees do at higher gear levels far outpaces anything any caster can do right now.  In the interest of full disclosure, I went from doing 800 DPS in Gruul/early SSC to 1100 DPS now raiding in BT, while rogues went from doing 700 DPS to doing 1600 DPS.  That kind of scaling is not healthy for the game.</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">That's true. The idea of hybrids buffs works as long as you get the perfect setup in raids. If you run with 4 rogues, a feral, a fury warrior and an enhancement, like we do normally, 2 of those are cursed to do lower dps than what their class is capable of.<br>
<br>
Which makes me go back to whining about the concept of groups of 5 instead of 6 unlike almost every other MMO out there. If anything, one of the wishes i have as raid leader is that they increase the group slots to 6, or the concept of cross class buffs will not work efficiently.</div>

</div>This is a problem I saw coming shortly before we added an enchancement shaman to the raids, we had a very melee heavy set-up to begin with, so adding something that's complimentry to melee would seem like a good thing. Except for the fact you're either going to have to:<br>
<br>
1. Only have 3 rogues per raid, and always have 1 sit out.<br>
2. Always have the lowest performer sit out of the melee group. This, while being the most beneficial option to the raid's DPS due to the scaling enchancement Shamans give to rogues, but also causes a big morale loss to the one considered the lower performer.<br>
3.Alternate between who's in the melee group each raid. Not having the best performers in the melee group will offer less overall DPS to the raid, and that defeats the point of having an enchancement Shaman in the first place...to max a raid's DPS. Doesn't it?</div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">An innate bias against rogues?  That's completely you being emotional and having a completely skewed point of view.<br>
<br>
Any rational caster denounced the tailoring sets as being completely overpowered and requiring nerfs, look at my very old posts, I did because they were and are still too good.  I still wear my full FSW and my guild just killed Archimonde, and I replaced spellstrike only after we killed Vashj.<br>
<br>
It is a lot more important to be extremly powerful in the endgame than to be extremly powerful levelling up or in mid-tier raids.  Every single min/maxer would rather choose a class that sucked in mid-level raids but dominated high end raids.<br>
<br>
Rogues were targetted for nerfs since the high end damage that melees do at higher gear levels far outpaces anything any caster can do right now.  In the interest of full disclosure, I went from doing 800 DPS in Gruul/early SSC to 1100 DPS now raiding in BT, while rogues went from doing 700 DPS to doing 1600 DPS.  That kind of scaling is not healthy for the game.</div>

</div>I think you need to re-read my posts. I'll point out once again that I'm sure a majority of the posters on this forum work to be open-minded and fair, and my comments about a bias againsts rogues (or melee in general) wasn't directed at anyone posting here. That initial comment was my impression about the general WoW community and I said to take it with a grain of salt. <br>
<br>
However, when TBC came out there were several anti-melee components that were designed in. Just look at the design of the instances from the five mans on up at the initial release. How many anti-melee components were in the game and then later removed or toned down because they were overly harsh? Why design around those in the first place unless you are intentionally trying to limit the amount of melee in a group/raid. Couple that with the lack of changes to the caster sets and the swiftness of the changes to multiple items (instead of just the suspect ones) to pull melee damage down. I don't think the devs "hate" rogues (or melee classes), but the retarded anti-melee encounters and trash that existed initially could have lead one to the conclusion that they were trying to limit their usefulness. <br>
<br>
I don't want to get into too deep a discussion of melee haste vs. caster haste, but I will say that it's apples vs. oranges. Melee haste affects white damage (primarily) that is not impacted by the GCD while caster haste is the opposite. They should not be charged the same in regards to ilevel because melee haste is more powerful (in my opinion) so it should have a higher cost. Melee haste should be balanced against hit, since due to the itemization you have to sacrifice one to get the other. Saying that melee haste and caster haste should be identical is showing a lack of understanding in how the two impact their target classes. They cannot be compared on a one to one basis. (This is a response to a post earlier about melee haste, not the quoted post.)<br>
<br>
I'm going to challenge your numbers a bit based on my experience (feel free to look at Fusion web stats, that's what I'm drawing these numbers from). Looking at non-aoe fights in SSC going back as far as July (we were in BT, working on Gorefiend) I see our mages pulling 1000 - 1200 dps, while as a dagger rogue I was pulling about the same. I'd like to be able to see parses further back (they've rolled off), but I do know that I was doing around 700 dps on Patchwerk at 60 in Nax, so your claim that rogues went from 700 dps in SSC is incorrect, unless it was a seriously undergeared rogue. On current fights in BT mages are pulling 1300-1500 dps while the rogues are doing 1600-1900 (sometimes over 2k depending on the nature of the fight). Rogues definitely scaled better, but not to the degree you are trying to say in your post. Note I compared rogues to mages, not shadow priests, since mages (and warlocks) are our primary casting class dps competitors. I know very little about shadow priests and how they scaled, but I do know that the mana regen you guys give to caster classes is invaluable, and might be part of the reason your damage doesn't scale as well as mage damage did, that would be a question for the dev team. They seem to balance dps vs. utility, which is one argument for rogues being top dps since we have no group buffs and very little utility outside of our damage. <br>
<br>
Personally, I think rogues are fairly well balanced against the caster classes right now, so I don't think I'm being overly emotional in my statements.</div>

		<div id="post_message_537634">Im only really replying to the OP since that was my reasoning for even entering this thread. Can't take the time to read every post here at work (This is gonna take me long enough to write up) so sorry if I repeat what has already been said.<br>
<br>
My guild has had a dilema on who would get our second set (we havn't got a MH yet, but this is assuming we get another OH). It's between a fury warrior and a rogue that have equal attend, skill, etc. We're leaning heavily towards the rogue now and the reasoning is pretty clear cut.<br>
<br>
Now I am a rogue so I guess this may seem bias, but I really did try to see if a warrior could gain as much use out of the weapons. Sorry, I couldn't really find much failed. <br>
<br>
I'll start my reason with PvE improvemnts that have to do with basically the proc and offhand itself. Rogues have Combat Potency, the offhand is the fastest weapon in the game (good weapon) and with the haste proc and other haste abilities the amount of energy regen would be an insane DPS boost. The other thing we get with haste and this is just my logical speculation, I may be incorrect, is more Sword Spec procs aswell as poison procs. SS/Poison procs makes up a good deal of our DPS which will also be effected by the haste proc and speed of the offhand weapon. <br>
<br>
I've also been told that rage generation really isn't a problem for fury Warriors, so the haste for them would just be a straight up white damage increase and not much more (correct me if I am wrong there). Fury Warriors wouod also have a pretty substantial threat problem. Now I know your getting your threat to drop in 2.3, but speaking as a rogue even with vanish I get threat capped myself, or close to it. On certain fights I have to feint a few times while waiting for my Vanish to actually come back up, that or take it easy for the first 10-20% not going all out so I can use my vanish a bit further into the fight (and I don't even have a MH yet). Without vanish there is no way a fury warrior will not get threat capped on a good deal of fights, which makes it a bit of waste quite frankly. O and my tank has good threat on most fights, with 2 MDs, he wears a large amount of block gear to actually increase threat so lets not use that as an excuse =P<br>
<br>
Now especially with the new Hemo ability getting revised to 125% weapon damage, the Mainhand will be insane as a Hemo weapon (unless they normalize Hemo of course). Regardless to rogues having hemo as a good enough reason to want the MH or combo, rarely will Warriors, even using Twin Blades, be Fury for PvP. MS would just be kinds stupid to give up honestly. Rogues on the other hand would gain great use out of this in PvP aswell as they would PvE. So even though I think the guilds best interest is to look for PvE first, this is a secondary reason why yet again a rogue would make better use of the swords.<br>
<br>
As I've said, id love to find a good reason to award fury warriors to compete for this item with similar skilled/dedicated rogues, but it doesn't seem like it would be in the best interest of the guild. The fury warriors will get theirs (atleast in our guild eventually) if they drop, but rogues definitely seem to be the popular first choice to recieve the weapons for a reason. <br>
<br>
Sorry to all the fury warriors /cry</div>

Your perspective on rogues versus caster balance are completely the opposite of mine so I will leave it at that, but if you think that the nerfs were due to emotional arguments instead of looking at the numbers and drawing conclusions we probably disagree fundamentally on what makes a class balanced.<br>

</div>We had similiar discussion regarding who would get our first warglaive. It was between three rogues and a fury warrior. I knew a rogue would be better off with it, but the difference wasn't enough for us to prevent the warrior from having a chance at it. We hadn't really talked about being threat capped. I'm actually going to go ahead and say that a warrior will only be threat capped with the warglaives on Bloodboil and RoS, and warriors pull aggro on RoS anyways.<br>
<br>
When 2.3 came out, the warrior simply said "I don't want it anymore". The combat potency advantage was there, combined with the 2.3 note that warrior whirwlind will hit with both weapons, convinced our warrior that a slower offhand might be better than a fast one.<br>
<br>
The warglaives are probably still going to be the best dps weapons for a fury warrior, but they're much better off on a rogue especially with the coming changes.</div>

</div>I don't get your contridictions. I never said it would be based purely on class, the senario in my guild that I gave were that 2 equally deserving people are up for the weapons and we choose the rogue over the warrior in the long run after reviewing class analysis. The guild raids to raid and defeat content, if your guild wants to give archimonde bows to melee b4 hunters thats fine, but its not in the best interest for you guild. True that exaple is a bit harsh, but Illidan legendaries are better for rogues flat out, understand that. If its between two equal deserving people and one is a warrior the other is a rogue, the rogue should get it, at least thats the way we see it (we = the majority).<br>
<br>
As for the Hemo being normalized, I said that may be true. Regardless do warrior PvP as fury? I also didn't mention this in "the same breath" it was a secondary reason and not a major one at that.<br>
<br>
Most people are trying to be a bit open minded here, as well as myself. Im open to suggestive critisim, but id be cool if it was a bit more of a general perspective.<br>
<br>
edit: Id add Teron Gorefiend to the list of threat cap encounters, assuming you don't get ghosted of course. Notice all these fights are straight up all out DPS fights, other fights have gimics that make you either stop dps for a period of time, switch to another gimic of the encounter, or an aggro dump. So basically any fight that allows you to make full all out use of your gear/consumables you'd be threat capped as a warrior.</div>

Using this argument to state that rogues are the only proper owners of the Warglaives is simply stupid and ignorant. A fury warrior decked out in the Warglaives along with having a proper tank doing his job will be doing just as fine as a Rogue with the Warglaives.<br>
<br>
Also, the Whirlwind argument is rather silly, an instant attack with both weapons every 10 seconds (8 seconds talented) will most likely not justify the use of a slower off-hand over the Warglaive. Not to mention that many fury warriors prefer a faster off-hand, simply because of the smoother rage generation.</div>

</div>Have you even done the math on this? WW is normalised and also gets offhand penalty, so going going from one of the hardest hitting weapons to a 1.4 speed you only lose 1% dps, if even that. Of course, you'll gain that back from the smoother rage generation it will provide you as well as the fact that you will be able to execute on every gcd. This doesn't even take into account that warglaive is 9dps above the 2nd best offhand.<br>
<br>
As to which class can get the most out of it, definitely rogues by far. Simply can't beat the synergy of slow/fast combined with haste effects and an aggro wipe. The gap will be smaller in 2.3 though.<br>
<br>
Here's some trivia for you:<br>
First 3 horde guilds to kill Illidan<br>
Nihilum - 21 kills<br>
Last Resort - 20 kills<br>
Curse/MYM - 20 kills<br>

MS Warriors were generally nerfed because at that point a geared MS Warrior with a healer was an unstoppable killing machine in PvP.  Even in hindsight I don't think Sulfuras was overpowered...if anything it was a decent idea for a Legendary.  Status symbol that reflected your commitment and your guild's advancement, awesome PvP toy, but not a game-changing boost to raid performance or DPS.  It was made obsolete by the end of the next dungeon (Ashkandi).  Also, MS Warriors were never the top DPS class...our Sulfuras Warrior never beat out the geared Rogues with Perdition's Blade.</div>

Mace spec warriors were uncommon, Sulfuras was uncommon, 2 eyes in 56 Ragnaros kills for us, straight from dkp. 10% better than say the next best option does not equate to overpowered.

</div>Kaz'rogal has stuns not sure how much that factors into the aggro, but I myself don't even get threat capped there so your right. Naj'entus has spinels and the shield to interrupt dps while the tank is still gaining aggro, or maybe I have no idea what im talking about, but for what ever reason I know yet again that is another fight where I am also not threat capped.<br>
<br>
Teron Gorefiend on the other hand is a definite fight where high dps will be threat capped. Our tank wears a large amount of block gear on the fight to help improve aggro generation and I still get a bit threat capped when going all out (I catch up even after vanishing at 80ish%). I do use drums of haste, get 1-2 heroisms, and pop haste pots on usually every cool down while being agil potted with a warp burger, but I assume going all out when talking about threat capped. I'm modeling this aggro cap on what I myself am capable of. If a rogue like myself that does 1800DPS on Teron is nearing threat cap even with vanish I am making the general assumption a warrior with duel legendaries (and appropriatedly decked out in full BT/Hyjal gear) will be doing some pretty similar, and I hope more damage with less threat drops and no vanish at all.<br>
<br>
I am in no way complaining under normal situations that these bosses are problematic and normally threat capped encounters, I'm just using logical reason and saying there most definitely will be warriors threat capped on them with Twin Blades as I myself am pretty close as a rogue.<br>
<br>
Edit: Yea excuse any grammatical/spelling errors, it's late and I have to wake up early, so I can't even bother to proofread and fix them =P</div>

The real question everyone should be asking is what will the Sunwell have in store.<br>

But then you have the Arena Season 3 factor, and the question of whether or not they're going to buff BT/Hyjal weapons similar to how they buffed SSC/TK weapons. Current BT/Hyjal = 100/130, Arena = 103/134.<br>
<br>
If BT/Hyjal weapons are buffed to be brought in line with Arena weaponry, you MIGHT see 109 DPS 1-handers, and 142 DPS 2-handers in Sunwell. If not, you'll just end up with the 106/138 combo.</div>

The thing about having a Thunderfury shortly after they became available was the absolutely ridiculous upgrade that it was. Because basically all of of the damage came from the proc, it let me run around in my full PvE tank gear, as prot spec, and tear Warriors and Shamans apart like they were butter. It was more the survivability from being free to wear tank gear, rather than the raw dps that the Thunderfury put out that made it so dominating. Ah, the good old days.</div>

		<div id="post_message_541998">The threat cap argument bothers me a lot.<br>
<br>
Especially when you say gorefiend is threat capped. He definately isn't. <br>
This is the one fight I can actually go all out on my tps as a prot tank and show how good I am.<br>
Baring how many crits I get and such obviously. With 2 md's as we normally run as least 2 hunters. I push between 1k to 1.4k tps at least. It does vary from time to time.<br>
<br>
Chhybrid is a rogue in the guild with almost the best gear a rogue can get and a offhand warglaive and he does a retarded amt of dps. We have had discussions and if he vanishes at 80% he will never catch back up to me in tps. Though he usually uses vanish either b4 or after heroism (unsure).<br>
<br>
As per fury warriors. It's usually a non issue until 'execute range' in the fight UNLESS the warrior does not have salvation. Or I'm getting shitty tps. Too many dodges/parrys ect.<br>
<br>
As of last night 1 of our fury warriors has a offhand warglaive.<br>
<br>
I await the day that I can test myself vs. dual warglaives in the tps battle of the century. Too bad they are receiving a nerf.<br>
<br>
Saying I can beat out their tps on every fight is untrue though obviously.<br>
<br>
As per the dicussion who should get a Warglaive? I would have loved to give them to the 3-4 rogues who raided all of hyjal/bt content with us. But since we have completed it they do not logon much and we have recruited some new rogues. We decided last night to give the 2nd offhand to a warrior over a rogue. Was it the right decision? Well the fury warrior has been in the guild for a extremely long time and is very loyal. The other 2 rogues were somewhat newer to the guild and 1 was a recruit.<br>
<br>
Just hope you make the right decision and move on. The warglaives will eventually be outdated!</div>

</div>The issue is that 1150 is pretty much the max SUSTAINED TPS you can put out. Now. In full T6-level tank gear, with properly chosen shield block items to push threat as high as possible. A couple of lucky Shield Slam crits are *not* going to skew your sustained TPS numbers appreciably.<br>
<br>
And each MD adds ~ 25 TPS. Assuming you have 4 hunters, and they religiously burn them, maybe you can hit 1250. But you can't *sustain* 1.4k TPS. It's just not possible. Read the thread. They did some fairly serious testing to prove this, mostly because people constantly make exaggerated claims like "I do 2k TPS on Gruul!!!1!!!1" and they wanted to shoot them down. <br>
<br>
And that lends more credence to the threat cap discussion re: fury warriors and the warglaives. It helps that fury warriors tend to put out a lot of their dps at the end of a fight, and if they're careful, and grab a TA totem early on, they can give themselves enough of a threat ceiling that they *can* DW+Reck+Haste Pot+Heroism+Drums+Execute spam. For about 20 seconds, before catching the tank. <br>
<br>
If you truly feel that 1.4k TPS is possible, please post on that other thread and help the theorycrafters there figure out how. Because I'm honestly interested in it, seeing anything learned will help my guild and our tanks, who are constantly being pushed by our rogues, fury warriors, and warlocks.</div>

edit: O and I usually save my CD's for when we get a heroism so I usually don't use my long CD's before I Vanish at 85-90% most boss fights so I can get the vanish CD up again and I most definitely catch up on threat. I never measured my TPS, but im pretty sure when I have heroism, haste pots, AR, Bladeflurry, Drums of Haste, and full pots I will be catching up to the tank rather quickly. Im not a spreed sheet or technical whizz, I base 99% of what I say of personal experiance though.</div>

</div>Uhh, as a rogue you shouldn't be even close to threat capped at 1800 dps.  You should point your main tank in the direction of some of the TPS threads on these forums for proper threat cycles.<br>

		<div id="post_message_543167">Threat cap happens sometimes and sometimes not... Sometimes the tank has excellent threat to start off and I can go all out and vanish later. Sometimes the tank has horrible threat to start and I go all out regardless and have to vanish sooner than normal. Sometimes I get a string of crits and procs and do some dumb amount of burst damage too which can lead to problems aka a early vanish. The majority of the time on fights like Teron the tank has average threat and it's not a problem, so I guess im saying he really isn't a threat capped encounter, but obviously can be if I vanish too early. After a vanish I can, and do catch up on threat, and I don't particularly blame that on the tank.<br>
<br>
What I am saying (for the 18th time!) is with dual legendaries, for warriors, it would be a threat capped encounter which is what this thread is about, proving why warrior would not be able to use the legendaries on these type of fights. I can't explain what I am saying any clearer... This argument is about the encounters being threat cap encounters to warriors with legendaries giving them less use out of them which at this point in the thread is irrelevant anyway. I only brought my self and rogue threat into the thread as an example, not something to argue about.</div>

</div>Though I am a rogue so you may see my oppinion as biased, I am also an officer of our guild and this is the exact reasoning behind our decisions about warglaive distribution when/if they drop (13 kills? and counting).<br>
<br>
Fury is less optimal then bloodfrenzy.. our 2hand dps warrior outputs a ton of dps while giving all the melee dps classes 4% more damage, factor that in for tps, hunter pets.. ect it adds up to a pretty significant loss if you have a fury warrior instead.<br>
<br>
For this reason they will go to rogues first, because rogues benefit much more from warglaives then warriors do.</div>

</div>Well put and noted.<br>
Maximizing raid dps is always important, one problem we currently have however is that the main DPS warrior that we use is under the odd impression that fury does a lot more dps than arms.<br>
Stubborn critter that he is, i've been unable to persuade him otherwise.<br>
<br>
It might just be something in his playstyle, that he just can't keep up the Slam/MS rotation perfectly enough to outperform the less lag influenced attacks of a fury warrior. But perhaps he just needs some solid math to show him otherwise.<br>
Other than the 93 pages : <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302201030/http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t12386-warrior_future_dps_warrior/" target="_blank">[Warrior] Future of a DPS Warrior</a><br>
Or 13 pages : <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080302201030/http://elitistjerks.com/f31/t17022-warrior_dps_spreadsheet_2_3_beyond/" target="_blank">[Warrior] DPS Spreadsheet 2.3 and beyond</a><br>
<br>
Is there any concrete information on why Arms outdamages a Fury spec warrior?<br>
Blood frenzy is obviously a large part in it, but again with him being a stubborn critter i've been unable to drop 2 points in flurry to get that talent back when he still was Arms specced.<br>
<br>
<br>
On the subject of the Glaives, we've now got Combat, and Hemo specced rogues.<br>
Hemo gains more from the mainhand than combat does(125% weapon damage), while combat gains more from the offhand than hemo would (combat potency).<br>
I'm sure the difference is very marginal to what is optimal, but hemo feels like it should outperform combat even with these weapons.</div>

</div>That's probably what he sees as well, and is sadly his main focus (topping the meters) while ignoring all other buffs.<br>
And being an officer, i can't just leave him outside the raid because of his spec. He's still among the top5 damage dealers regardless.<br>
So i need to persuade him back into arms, because the other dps warrior we had just doesn't play as much anymore and the raid is thus left without blood frenzy.<br>
I have the same difficulty with getting our hunter officer to spec survival.<br>
<br>
Our raid is fairly melee heavy :<br>
1-2 Dps warriors<br>
1-2 Rogues<br>
1-3 BM hunters + 1-3 pets<br>
2 Warrior tanks<br>
1 Enhancement shaman<br>
2 Feral druids<br>
And occassionally a retribution paladin or Demon warlock.<br>
Estimate between 9-15 physical dps targets in the raid.</div>

</div>Does he really have to point you towards the Class Mechanics forums when the threads linked above do it already? Theorycraft and anecdotal evidence(WWS) suggest that a well played MS/Slam rotation is competitive in terms of personal dps with Fury rotations. When factoring in the +4% damage buff to other physical damage classes(Bloodfrenzy, or do I need to prove this too?) one sees a net raid dps increase that is greater than the personal dps differential between the two specs. There are WWS parses with arms warriors cranking out &gt; 1800dps and their fury compatriots doing 2100. You can see with simple math that it only takes four other physical dps classes performing at the same level for the MS warrior's raid-dps benefit to match the differential in personal dps levels. Add another rogue/hunter/fury warrior, and you see that Arms clearly beats Fury. And this is assuming that the other classes are only MATCHING the arms warrior point for point DPS wise, when you have three rogues all topping 2200 dps, and two-three hunters matching them, then the raid benefit of Blood Frenzy is even greater.</div>

		<div id="post_message_560966">It really all depends. I have been able to do pretty much what Angeron said, I have done 2066 dps on Teron as DW fury, and the best ive ever done as arms was 1940, but this was just insane, 1800's is more accurite I think for good arms dps. Now, if your raid is 3 rogues, dps warrior enhance shaman 3 hunters or something, then arms is clearly better. However, our guild runs really caster heavy. Often, we only have 1 hunter, 2 rogues, 1 enhance 1 feral, and then me. so, blood frenzy benafits 5 people. I can do great dps as arms, but I can do greater dps as DW fury. Both are good. I think if we somehow changed to have more physical dps, 33/28 would be the clear choice, but as it stands for us now it doesn't seem to matter which spec I go, either way I do my part of adding a lot of dps. <br>
<br>
Eh, so for a melee heavy guild, rogue first makes sense because the war would be 33/28. Melee light, I think it can go either way.</div>

		<div id="post_message_561517">But Cruor, you're missing out on something.  If your personal DPS only falls off by 200 when switching to Arms, then you're STILL better off going with Arms, even if only "5 people" benefit.  The rogues will likely be doing the same DPS you do (and should be better), the hunter will likely do slightly less DPS than you, and the feral + tanks will also get your buff.  I guarantee you that your raid would do more damage if you specced Arms, even if you only pack in 5 physical DPSers.<br>
<br>
For example, taking the numbers you threw out there: you do 2000 DPS on Teron.  For argument's sake, we'll say the 2 rogues do the exact same damage per second (hah) -- 2000 per.  If you'd specced Arms, they'd be doing an extra 60 DPS each, making up for over half the difference in your own personal DPS.  Just from the rogues, and just assuming that they do (only) the same DPS you do.<br>
<br>
If the raid only brings 1 warrior, he should be Arms, unless there are no other physical DPSers present.  The personal DPS difference is not great enough to outweigh the raid-wide boost to all physical DPSers blood frenzy provides.<br>
<br>
<br>
But we're off topic.  Rogues tend to get warglaives because people try to maximize their raid's DPS.  Rogues tend to do more DPS (often times much more) than their corresponding DPS warriors.  I really think it's as simple as that: maximization.</div>

		<div id="post_message_561705">I'll toss my 2 cents in here...<br>
<br>
I'm fury warrior/raid leader and just happen to have the most DKP in our system. So if/when the warglaives drop they could be mine. (we are 3/5, 3/9, so we have a ways to go ATM)<br>
<br>
I will be passing the first set to whichever rogue bids the most. And throwing a medium/large sized bid on the second set....huge on the third.<br>
<br>
As has been mentioned, if you bring 1 warrior it should be arms, and any warriors after that could/should be fury. Where as arms is a 8-15% personal damage loss, Blood frenzy is about 4% per person that benefits, so if you have 2-4= other physical damage classes with comparable DPS, then Arms is the clear winner. Any raid that doesn't have at least 4 physical dps is....not normal from my experience. Eg. last night in hyjal we ran a fury warrior, feral druid (mostly dpsing but OT on trash) 3 rogues and 2 hunters, which makes 7, or about 3-4 more then needed for the break even point. If i had been Arms over fury i'd likely have seen an overall raid DPS increase of ~4% x 6 physical dps classes (each doing ~1000dps on bosses) for whatever loss i suffered. So if i lost less then 250 DPS, i'd likely have added more raid DPS.</div>

</div>There's a DPS warrior spreadsheet where you can see potential maximum dps with various weapon setups.<br>
<br>
I made an optimum 2h item setup and an optimum warglaive setup - the results? About 1500dps for 2h (cata's edge), about 1600 dps with warglaives.<br>
<br>
Assuming you have two rogues in the raid that do the same dps as you without blood frenzy (1500), and 500 of that dps is from poisons (an extreme exaggeration), that's an extra 40 dps apiece they're getting from your buff. Even with a pally tank that holds aggro with spells and doesn't melee at all, no hunters, no felguards, etc, you still bring the same amount to the raid with the blood frenzy that you would with warglaives with 2 rogues and no other physical dps or tanks.<br>

If you only have one dps warrior, it's not even close.</div>

</div>Imp Tclap and Imp Demo are just as easy to take as 17/44 as for 33/28, so that's rather moot. I guess you could try to argue that UBW is better for DW, and ergo a bigger loss if you take imp demo, but I think that since they converted it to PPM, it's probably pretty equal, if not better for 2H which (from what I've heard, I haven't tried it for a while except in PvP) is more likely to be rage starved.<br>
<br>
Still, Blood Frenzy is stupidly good. My guild currently has 3 DPS warriors, all DW Fury. I permanently feel guilty about not being BF spec, but I just cannot stand 2H in PvE anymore (and I used to be biggest fan of slam way back before it was cool - slam with Sulfuras was good times).</div>
