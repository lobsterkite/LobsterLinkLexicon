		<div class="intellitxt" id="post_message_1060208"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I've seen it mentioned a couple of times that it would be a good idea to create a discussion on pets to get solid numbers and get the facts straight, and I figured I would get the ball rolling here.<br>
<br>
I'll combine some of the information found in other threads on here so far from what has been established, or guidelines people have developed for usage of pets in their specific roles (i.e. when to use AotD)<br>
<br>
<b><u><font size="5">Army of the Dead</font></u></b><br>
<br>
<font size="3"><b>Facts</b></font><br>
<ul><li>AotD can be used on raid bosses, it appears that any mob marked as a raid boss is not tauntable by AotD, this applies to both 10 and 25 man versions of bosses</li>
<li>AotD will still taunt non-boss mobs even in a boss scenario, such as lava adds or whelps on Sartharion</li>
<li>It does not appear that Night of the Dead reduces AoE damage taken by AotD from the 3.0.8 patch, but further testing is needed (credit Mooncrow)</li>
<li>AotD does not appear to receive raid buffs, such as LotP or Heroism (credit Mooncrow)</li>
<li>From testing, it appears that AotD does benefit from UP, which would be beneficial to switch to before using it if using AotD before a boss pull (such as on Patchwerk or Thaddius).  DPS loss vs gain switching to UP during combat would probably be negligible. (Credit to Fugazor)</li>
<li>If you have a perma-ghoul out, it appears you can have some level of control over AotD.  The pet follow command seems to cause them to come to you, and if ghoul leap is turned on, they should leap with him.  This is not a certainty though, as this seems inconsistent at best. (Credit to AmeroGER)</li>
</ul><br>
<b><font size="3">When to Use it</font></b><br>
<br>
<b>Bosses in Naxx:</b><br>
<br>
Arachnid Quarters<br>
Anub'rekhan - Can be tricky to use here with the adds and impales going around the raid.  I'd recommend just after the first 2 adds go down, pop army and swap over to Anub.  This should put them on him and give a good chunk of burn time.<br>
<br>
Faerelina - Definitely not a good idea to use pre-pull, with the adds and all, but it can easily be used during P2 when it's just a burn on her.<br>
<br>
Maexxna - Use this right after a webspin, and army should go right to the boss.  Be careful if you haven't killed off all the adds before you get spun though, as they might start attacking them instead.<br>
<br>
Construct Wing<br>
Patchwerk - Two good times to use it on this boss.  The time I prefer is pre-pull, doing the method described below, where you swap to unholy presence, use a speed pot, and then just pull them out.  The second would be well after the pull when you need a little bit of extra dps towards the end, just don't use it too late.<br>
<br>
Grobbulus - Very tough to use it here, lots of poison and adds constantly through the fight.  This fight might not be the best bet to use it on, and could probably be saved for Gluth since he comes up quite quickly afterwards<br>
<br>
Gluth - Best to use this right after the tanks have established agro and pulled it to the door.  This can be a tricky thing with the adds coming out, but if you have people kiting them properly, you shouldn't ever see any "food" near Gluth.  I'd probably give this about 30-40 sec into the fight to use it, but certainly try it earlier if you feel comfortable doing so.<br>
<br>
Thaddius - Definitely use this right after you kill the adds and go into P2<br>
<br>
Plague Wing<br>
Noth the Plaguebringer - Use this pre-pull as your best time.  Can also be used later in after he comes back from a teleport, but it might be trickier with possible adds up.<br>
<br>
Heigan the Unclean - Tricky to get this used well with the dance, might be best to save for Loatheb.  If anything, this is again a good time to use pre-pull.<br>
<br>
Loatheb - Good boss as it's a straight tank and spank.  If you're using a group system to pick up the spores, probably a good idea to use this just after your group has picked one up.<br>
<br>
Military Quarters<br>
Instructor Razuvious - Very tricky to use with the adds up, but once this gets underway if all adds are being properly CC'd, this might be a decent place to use it about 30 sec into the fight.  Missed MC could be problematic the further you go into the fight, and it might just be better to hold off till Gothik anyways.<br>
<br>
Gothik the Harvester - Those on dead side can easily use this as soon as he comes into that side of the room, especially if you have a mod indicating when he's going to port in.  Live side might be trickier, but you can still get a good dps increase if you use this as soon as he ports in (or again, before he comes if you can predict it).<br>
<br>
Four Horsemen - Definitely a good fight pre-pull.  Also very handy to use if you're trying to blowup one of the horsemen with all dps stacked on one side.<br>
<br>
Sapphiron - Probably the only fight I wouldn't recommend army on.  The constant raid aoe just murders these guys.  Save it for KT.<br>
<br>
KT - Use this during P2, after the tank has some solid agro and all adds are down.  A bad void zone could ruin the dps here, but that's just luck.  Very tough to use near P3 when the adds come out, so the earlier you use it in P2, the better.<br>
<br>
<b>Bosses in Ulduar:</b><br>
<br>
Flame Levithan - can't be used<br>
<br>
Razorscale - Really tricky to use properly here, though you could probably pop it as he's coming down for the 50% when he's permagrounded.  Just make sure the adds are killed first.  Can probably be used during either of the transitions during P1 as well, assuming all adds are killed when he comes down.  To max dps, I'd recommend doing it after 50% though.<br>
<br>
XT - 002 Deconstructor - Used pre-pull is perfect or while waiting for the 1st heart might be a really good idea, especially if you are trying to activate hardmode and need to squeeze out the dps.  Just gotta be careful of the adds, which is why I'd recommend pre-pull or 1st heart.<br>
<br>
Ignis - The adds come out almost as soon as he hits the tank, and based on the strat our guild uses, we set the tank into position and use a hunter to misdirect, so your mileage may vary.  Pre-pull would be your best bet, but it can be done at the later stages if you've got some downtime between adds.<br>
<br>
Assembly of Iron - No adds, and this is kinda a dps race, so as long as you can trust your tanks to pull their add correctly, this is a good fight to use it on.  If trying hard mode, definitely a good time to use it just as you start in on Steelbreaker.<br>
<br>
Kologarn - Adds only come after the arm is destroyed, and burning his right arm down is the strat we used, so army worked well on the pre-pull here.<br>
<br>
Auriaya - Probably not a good idea to use these pre-pull, if you want your tanks to pickup the initial adds properly, but they could easily be used during the fight.  A lot of aoe damage, fears, and positional requirements might make this tricky to use at a good time, but just after a fear would probably be best to use this.<br>
<br>
Freya - Adds come during all of P1, but P2 is just a burn phase.  After the last add drops, go ahead and pull them out.<br>
<br>
Hodir - This should be fine to use them on prepull.  Usually I'm selfish here and will ask the tank to give a 6 sec countdown before he pulls, then immediately attack Hodir to put them on him (and then swap to iceblocks once they are set).<br>
<br>
Thorim - P2 is perfect for this.  If you get the adds in the arena done quickly before he jumps down, you should have a good chunk of time where you can't dps anyways.  Definitely wouldn't recommend doing this during P1, unless you are having issues picking the adds up off the healers in P1.<br>
<br>
Mimiron - This fight has a lot of opportunities to use it on since you get a solid pause between each phase.  I found it best to use on the 4th phase, since 1-3 don't really require a dps race, where as 4 is just a nightmare you want to end quickly.<br>
<br>
General Vezax (+) - You get a good amount of time before Vezax does anything special and it doesn't really matter anyways as the whole of our group was stacked on top of him for the strat we used.  Army was good every time as a pre-pull.  I wouldn't recommend this during hardmode, so that the OT can get some good threat, however I know that neither Vezax or the Animus can be taunted, so this might require further research.<br>
<br>
Yogg-Saron - An excellent fight to use AotD on.  The best time is during P2 when Crushers are out, because they interrupt the debuff on the raid without requiring a tank to lance it.  In addition, they do a good chunk of dps on burning the crushers down.  Just make sure you burn this well before P3, so it doesn't interfere with tanking the adds.<br>
<br>
Algalon - Can easily be used pre-pull due to Algalon not being aggressive at the start of each attempt.  Only word of caution I'd give on this fight would be if you have a tank pulling constellations into black holes as they are tauntable and could cause grief for a tank, so make sure to use this early on. <br>
<br>
<b>Bosses in Trial of the Crusader</b><br>
<br>
Northrend Beasts - The best time to use this seems to be on Gormok as a pre-pull.  The Jormunger are up for only a short time and have a knock-back, and there's a similar issue for Icehowl.<br>
<br>
Lord Jaraxxus - Hard to use army effectively in this encounter.  At any given time, there is usually a set of adds up that the OT needs to keep under control, and army easily taunts these adds, spinning them out of control.  Pre-pull would be the only place I could see using this, but it again depends on how your guild deals with the adds.  Mistress would be the easiest to deal with if you want to let the ghouls just tank them her for a second and annoy your OT.<br>
<br>
Faction Champions - Another pre-pull setup, but this one depends on the mode you're in and the initial pull strat you use.  In hard mode none of the adds can be taunted making it very easy to use army, but in normal they can be taunted, and you might want to avoid it if doing crowd control.  The other option is depending on raid composition, you might have 2 dk's setup to chain pull your initial burn target.  If this is the case, then army is very successful at remaining on that specific mob and can greatly help burn the target down.<br>
<br>
Twin Val'kyr -  Again, pre-pull setup.  This is tank and spank for the most part, really nothing else to say.  As of yet I haven't seen any information on how empowered light might affect them, but it should have none.<br>
<br>
Anub'arak - Best time I've found to use army here is during the burn phase at 30%.  We use a strat for his adds where we burn the first set, then leave the second set alone till he burrows (or hits his 30%) and usually hold off on taking him under until the first set of adds after his re-emergence is taken down.  Once that set of adds is gone, we let the OT pick them up but just let them submerge if they choose to, which is fine for the army.  You can use these pre-pull, but the first set of adds seem to be really troublesome for the OT to keep on the ice while they were out.<br>

				The following comes from Aldy on maximizing AotD dps:<br>
<br>
Ideal situation: Late in the fight; all three procs are up, heroism is out, use Empower, switch to unholy, use speed pot, summon gargoyle, summon AotD; boss lives for at least 45s.<br>
<br>
Realistic situation: 4 seconds pre-pull, while in UP, with Enh sham's WF down (not yet confirmed, but assumed), pop speed pot, channel AotD. Since OoC when potion is taken, it will CD and can be used later in the fight with Gargoyle and heroism. You lose the dmg of 1 BS switching back to BP, but gain it back through AotD buff.
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>As a final note on when to use AotD, it should always be used if the fight allows for it, even during combat.  The dps boost from AotD will far outweigh any personal dps loss during the the 6 second time period it takes to channel them.  Check the guidelines above on when best to use AotD from my own recommendation, but also use your own judgment if you feel comfortable in a particular encounter.<br>
<br>
<b><u><font size="5">Gargoyle</font></u></b><br>
<br>
<b><font size="3">Facts</font></b><br>
<ul><li>Gargoyle does benefit from Heroism, cast it after heroism is in effect.</li>
<li>Gargoyle takes a snap-shot of your stats when he gets summoned, so use it when trinkets/effects have procced to squeeze out the highest dps for it that you can.</li>
<li>Gargoyle appears to have AoE mitigation as of patch 3.0.8, 35% for each point in NotD.  This is both physical (effects like cleave and whirlwind) and magical (dragon breath attacks)</li>
<li>Gargoyle lasts for 30 seconds, costing 60 runic power in total.  It no longer </li>
</ul><br>
<b><font size="3">When to Use it</font></b><br>
<br>
As stated above, gargoyle is best used when all of your procs/trinkets have gone off.  If you need to activate trinkets, do so just before you summon gargoyle.<br>
<br>
<b><u><font size="5">Ghoul</font></u></b><br>
<br>
<b><font size="3">Facts</font></b><br>
<br>
Credit to Kurokaze on the Haste information and Oke for the AP/Str information.<br>
<ul><li>Ghouls work like most permanent pets, receiving a portion of your stats and can be buffed</li>
<li>At level 80, the ghoul has a base AP of 1167 and a base Str of 331</li>
<li>Ghoul Str = (DKStr * (.7 * RavDead)).  If you have the <a id="itemlink" class="q1" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100809222858/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=43549" target="_blank">[Glyph of the Ghoul]</a> then add <i>+ (DKStr * .4)</i> to the formula.</li>
<li>Ghoul Ap = Strength - Base_Str + Base_AP</li>
<li>Ghouls receive 100% of your haste; this is recent data from live.</li>
<li>Ghouls appear to have AoE mitigation as of patch 3.0.8, 35% for each point in NotD.  This is both physical (effects like cleave and whirlwind) and magical (dragon breath attacks)</li>
<li>Ghouls benefit from pet snacks (such as kibblers bits)</li>
<li>Ghoul hit rating rounds down, always.  So if you have 7.99% hit rating, the ghoul will have 7% hit rating</li>
<li>Ghoul Frenzy – This talent should only be taken if you have trouble keeping your Ghoul alive. If you do, it becomes invaluable, as a dead Ghoul is a large portion of your dps down the drain (due to 30 seconds of absolutely zero Ghoul damage, followed by your Ghoul doing reduced damage for the remainder of the fight from missing buffs). If you don’t have issues with your Ghoul going down, then skip this talent. In nearly every case it will be a dps loss. (Credit to Consider from the Unholy dps thread)</li>
<li>Ghouls gain expertise based on your hit rating. So if you had 131 hit (4%), the pet gains 13 expertise. 263 hit (8%), the pet gains 26 expertise. The Draenei hit aura does not give expertise to the pet. (Credit to Consider from the Unholy dps thread)</li>
</ul><br>
<b><font size="3">When to Use it</font></b><br>
<br>
Always!  It should go without saying, but maximizing keeping your ghoul alive is a huge dps boost, doing quite a bit of damage for the time it's out.  This is what makes NotD such an attractive talent, because you're pretty much guaranteed to have the Ghoul out at all times.<br>
<br>
<b><u><font size="5">Dancing Rune Weapon</font></u></b><br>
<br>
<b><font size="3">Facts</font></b><br>
<ul><li>DRW will gain buffs you have before casting it, but will not get things used after, i.e. Hysteria, potions, etc. Heart Strikes from DRW also are affected by its diseases, and the diseases will stay even after DRW has expired. For this reason it is proper to cast DRW before refreshing your diseases.</li>
</ul><br>
<b><font size="3">When to Use it</font></b><br>
<br>
Your DRW checklist looks something like this, in order of importance.<br>
<br>
    * 4 Death Runes<br>
    * On use trinkets<br>
    * Bloodlust<br>
    * Hysteria<br>
    * Empowered Rune Weapon<br>
    * Potion of Speed<br>
<br>
<br>
Hitting all of those criteria will maximize your DRWs DPS, very important to maximizing your own DPS.<br>
<br>
Obviously you can't always meet every criteria, as some are out of your control. You always want to wait for Hysteria if you think the fight will last long enough to do so, and you especially have to make sure your diseases are up and death runes are ready. If you have on use trinkets, you want to be sure to use them before popping DRW as well. Rarely will you be able to use Empowered Rune Weapon twice in one fight.<br>
<br>
I'm not a huge fan of waiting on trinket procs, like Greatness or Grim Toll/Mjolnir. I tend to take the approach that if they are up, awesome but if they are not I don't wait for them. If you "feel" like you are due for a proc, it might be worth waiting 1 or 2 CGDs, but I don't know that I would go much beyond that. This is especially true due to the fact that often times your DRW is part of a coordinated burst, like XT heart phase, and you dont want to be lagging behind waiting for a proc.<br>
<br>
That being said, if it is a long fairly straighforward fight like Ignis with no real burst phase requirement, I would probably wait to try to maximize my DPS. (All credit to SoilantGreen64)<br>
<br>
This list is pretty thin at the moment, so if there's information I missed (and I'm sure there is) please post it in here and I'll try and update the main post as soon as I can.  Also, please correct me on any misinformation posted here as well.  Thank you!<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div class="intellitxt" id="post_message_1060273"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Something I'd like to know for modeling purposes, that I haven't been able to test due to business and lack of motivation to respec, and I haven't seen discussed anywhere, is whether non-permanent ghouls get the same (or any) scaling from gear as perma-ghouls.<br>
<br>
I'd also like critrate data for all pets and damage date for AotD if anyone has that.<br>
<br>
I believe that ghouls have a 0.7% STR modifier to begin, and receive glyph and talent bonuses additively, for a total of 1.5% (1.7% postpatch). Note that ghouls get 1 AP per STR. I don't remember when I tested this; it might be from beta.<br>
<br>
Ghouls receive 100% of your haste; this is recent data from live. I just looked at character sheet speed, so there may potentially be a display bug involved.<br>
<br>
From this testing, I also noticed an interesting bug with ghouls and Improved Icy Talons: they receive haste benefit both from your personal haste and from the buff applying to them, as expected, however, when the buff fades, only one of these fades and they keep the other haste effect until their haste is refreshed in some other way, such as reapplying IT or swapping some gear. Again, this was just tested on the character sheet; it has a decent probability of being a simple display bug.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I've been able to stop the gargoyle and ghouls from pursuing a mob and even to move out of AoEs by commanding my pet ghoul to follow. I need to do further testing, but this seems to be the general case. I don't know if it is a bug or if it's intended.<br>

I would like some input on what the AotD ghouls attack first, if it's the target you are dealing damage or it's just random.

				<div style="font-style:italic">Just to add, unlike most minions, the gargoyle and AotD ghouls can be controled together with your pet-ghoul. I've been able to stop the gargoyle and ghouls from pursuing a mob and even to move out of AoEs by commanding my pet ghoul to follow. I need to do further testing, but this seems to be the general case. I don't know if it is a bug or if it's intended.</div>

I was soloing AQ20 this morning, and on Buru I have my ghoul run around and wear down eggs. I pull out my gargoyle, he starts of on Buru which was where I wanted him, and then I notice he's flown off after my ghoul to break eggs. Which got me killed. Dumb flying bastard.<br>
<br>
I control my ghoul through macro commands (/petattack in this case) so I'm not sure if this happens if you use the ghoul's actual petbar. Regardless it explains why sometimes my garg will follow the first target I sic him on and sometimes he'll assist me as I change targets.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div class="intellitxt" id="post_message_1060623"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->A few major questions that might be worth asking for general DPS purpose.<br>
<br>
1. Does army of the dead benefit from the player's haste? And does it benefit from self-buffs like trinkets and haste potions ?<br>
<br>
2. Is it worth it switching to unholy presence when you summon the gargoyle (and if 1 is true before AotD), you're sacrificing 2 runes (blood + unholy) and 2 GCD by doing this, but get 15% extra haste on your pet.<br>
<br>
3. What is the best time to use Army of the Dead ? <br>
A lot of people swear by using it before the pull saying it wont cost them dps time, however that means army of the dead isn't fully utilized either, other people swear by using it halfway in the fight, however they lose 6 seconds of dpsing while gaining full benefit from AotD.<br>
A great deal of this depends on the answer to question 1 as well I think.<br>
<br>
These are probably not the easiest questions, but knowing the answer to some of them will give us a better insight in how and when to use these pets to their full potential.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div class="intellitxt" id="post_message_1060680"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Here are some PTR tests.<br>
<br>
Gargoyle (used without any procs, selfbuffed):<br>
Blood Presence - 13 hits (1550 avg. dmg)<br>
                      -  12 hits (1563 avg dmg)<br>
Unholy Presence - 14 hits (1625 avg. dmg)<br>
                        - 15 hits (1527 avg. dmg)<br>
Conclusions:<br>
- Blood Presence does not work for Garg<br>
- Unholy Presence most likely does work for Garg<br>
- switching to UP to summon Garg is most likely not worth it as you gain 1-2 hits from Garg and one IT but loose one BS and one SS<br>
<br>
AotD (again no procs, self buffed):<br>
Blood Presence - 159 melee (32,5k dmg), 81 claw (25k)<br>
Unholy Presence - 181 melee (37k dmg), 74 claw (24k)<br>
Conclusion: <br>
- Blood Presence does not work for AotD<br>
- Unholy Presence most likely does work for AotD (claw looks random)<br>
<br>
There is also question about Bloodlust. If BL works like haste then it will increase damage of Gargoyle and AotD for most likely full duration when you spawn both after BL. This can be actually easily tested on dummy as long as you have some friendly shaman around - check number of Garg hits and AotD melee hits and mystery will be solved once and for all <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100809222858im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt="" title=";)" class="inlineimg"><!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

No one seemed to really care, and neither did I after some testing with Recount. With the 60 second Garg, I would get on average 23-25 strikes regardless of Blood/Unholy presence (on a dummy). I didn't test much though, so maybe it does have a real effect.<br>
<br>
Swapping Presences isn't on the GCD, they only have a one second shared cooldown. The only real concern is the rune cost, which messes with your rotation. This can be "fixed" by using Blood Tap.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I would have to check again after the maintenance today to see if that still holds true, but I believe our pets receiving our passive and active haste to be something that was added when pet scaling was revamped in Patch 3.0/Beta.  <br>

<br>
Even though there are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100809222858/http://www.wowhead.com/?search=Death+Knight+Pet+Scaling" target="_blank">modifiers listed</a>, I've observed other stats affecting our pets as well.  While Expertise is only listed under the Hunter Pet Scaling, doing two trials on the boss dummy (One at 26 Expertise, and another naked) leads me to believe that our ghoul scales with that stat as well.<br>

		<div class="intellitxt" id="post_message_1061543"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Great info, thanks for the PTR tests.<br>
<br>
Focusing on the question of gargoyle, and whether it is beneficial to swap to unholy first and then cast or not, I guess it comes down to what you're really losing.<br>
<br>
By using blood tap, you are losing in total 2 blood runes (assuming blood tap to "cover" the unholy rune), which for the most damage would be used on BS.<br>
<br>
I'm going to be generous in a calculation on it and assume the DK is using a <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100809222858/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=40384" target="_blank">[Betrayer of Humanity]</a> to give an average damage of 758.<br>
<br>
Blood strike would do 758/2 = 379, 379 + 191 + (95.5 * 3) = 855 hit or a 1710 crit.  Again, being generous and making it easy on myself, assuming a 50% crit rate would mean an average of 1283 damage per BS.  More likely the damage would be lower because I'm assuming some higher value base damage and a pretty high crit rate, but I think those are some decent rough figures.<br>
<br>
So you lose out on 2566 damage vs the gargoyle gain.  In the ptr tests from Fugazor, there's a 1 hit difference and a 3 hit difference on gargoyle, and per hit damage is around 1566.  If more tests showed the gargoyle does average to around 2 extra hits, you'd gain 3132 extra damage for a gain of about 566 damage.<br>
<br>
If you went very broad to cover a more realistic scenario the gains look to be a minor damage loss of a couple hundred to a gain of a couple thousand at most, so I'd have to agree that while using UP might be a gain, it would be slight at most.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Even if you could get a small dps gain out of it, the hassle around it, the using of a blood tap and the loss of GCDs might actually make it too annoying to be useful.<br>
<br>
Still need to get some solid evidence whether heroism/bloodlust is applied to the gargoyle itself, and thus you have to get it out before it is cast. <br>
Or whether it just gets a part of your haste, and you have a much broader window to use it.<br>
<br>
I unfortunately don't have a pocket shaman to test with at the moment.<br>
And to get some good readings you'd probably have to do 2-3 tries on each of the 3 cases (without bl / before summoning / after summoning) to iron out the most severe inconsistencies.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Nice math as well, but don't forget that 2H builds arent the only builds that use the goyle. DW builds also use them and are affected to a lesser extent by the loss of a Blood and Unholy rune. the second Unholy rune is typically near useless for 32/39 and 20/51. Blood runes also don't do much dmg through BS or PT, but you do lose a Deathrune conversion (can be solved by abusing blood tap).<br>
<br>
Maybe a nice idea to look into would be to start the fight in Unholy presence. This at the very least solves the AotD issue and ,if you are rich enough to have the greatness card, also gives you a very solid chance to just fire your goyle with at least 2 procs up within the first 15 sec of the fight anyway. You lose some dmg from being in Unholy presence for a while, but save one extra U rune. Alternatively you can burn your ERW for the presencedance. For speccs that have little to no free GCD's (most DW builds, Blood 2H) it hardly matters when you use ERW anyway. This may be different for 2H unholy, with its low amount of casts.<br>
<br>
One thing I am still interested in is the effect seen in earlier gargoyl tests where the gargoyle DPS would go up a lot if you boost its haste by a lot, but strangely causes a dps decrease when you only use a small haste effect on it. Also the way the goyle works with BL (I'm thinking it does not matter either way. It uses your haste or can get buffed with BL. same effect either way around) and if it benefits from the double IIT haste bug like the ghoul. Since the goyle looks at your haste (plus your IIT) and gets buffed with its own IIT, I would again assume it does get buffed. Point of interest here is that this effect may cause IIT to be better then the shaman haste totem. I have no idea if pets (im assuming hunter pets also double dip from haste) can also double dip the totem buff or not, it may work differently as an aura effect.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Just as an update, i checked my gargoyle during a heroic today and from what i saw it does NOT get the bloodlust buff. It could just be a bug or something, so might want more people to test it. But if thats true it would seem that summoning gargoyle WHILE bloodlust is up is better than summoning it BEFORE bloodlust goes up. <br>

Just as an update, i checked my ghoul during a heroic today and from what i saw it does NOT get the bloodlust buff. It could just be a bug or something, so might want more people to test it. But if thats true it would seem that summoning gargoyle WHILE bloodlust is up is better than summoning it BEFORE bloodlust goes up. <br>
<br>
This would make my and that of a lot of DK i assume a lot easier.</div>

It says only spell, but I'd find it rather "lame" if they didnt add protection like abilities as whirlwind or physical effects.<br>

Oh, and for the fun of it, if you summon army of the dead when farming old L60 raid instances... do NOT, under any circumstance, summon the army during Bloodlord Mandokir. I duo-ed the place with another DK, and we both summoned it at the same time.

The new corpse explosion is a lot more interesting now that it doesnt use up runes anymore.<br>

				That means that in theory every 40 seconds you can do the following:<br>
<br>
- Explode your current ghoul for 25% of its HP, if this HP means current raid buffed it could be around 5k dmg !<br>
- Explode the corpse of your ghoul for another 1-1.2k dmg (raid buffed again), this has been tested to be possible<br>
- Summon a new ghoul<br>
<br>
That is 6k dmg each 40 seconds for 80 RP which is much much more than you can get from DC or UB.<br>
<br>
However tests need to be done to see if its actually worth sacrificing 3 GCDs for. Since those aren't always available.<br>
<br>
Actually to come back on that, on a single target it might be best not to explode the actual corpse, its probably a waste of 40 RP that can be used on a DC or UB.<br>
<br>
But still we're talking about 4-5k dmg here every 40 seconds. Thats pretty heavy.<br>
<br>
Some quick very abstract napkin math, say it do 4k damage each 40 seconds.<br>
You replace a death coil that could have done 2k dmg. So in fact you gain 2k dmg every 40 seconds or 50 dps<br>
<br>
50 DPS, thats quite something for a talent thats widely regarded as useless.

</div>I'll go have a look at it.<br>
<br>
I think the issue is in the fact you're not using the ability on your ghoul, you're more or less ordering your ghoul to use the ability himself.<br>
<br>
So maybe the macro doesn't work well in that case.<br>
<br>
I'm going to try some stuff today, and ill let you know.<br>
<br>
EDIT: <br>
Actually, try this:<br>
<br>
/target pet<br>
/cast Corpse Explosion<br>

<br>
I'm not entirely confident, but from what I've seen and talked to other people, it goes something like this: You can basically raise as many ghouls as you have Corpse Dust for at the point in time your Raise Dead glyph goes in (for most people, this is probably at patch.) If you have 20 Corpse Dust, that means you can get 20 ghouls. After 20 casts the bug "kicks in" and you won't be able to raise any more, because the game sees you as not having any more corpse dust.<br>
<br>
I was able to raise ghouls all day on Tuesday because I didn't have the raise dead glyph, but last night I put it in with ~16 corpse dusts in my inventory. After a full Naxx and OS run (casting like 5 ghouls on sapphiron &gt;.&lt;) I was no longer able to get any more ghouls.<br>
<br>
This would also explain why you can get ghouls if you in fact have a 72+ humanoid corpse, but you are unable to get ghouls under circumstances in which you would need corpse dust.<br>
<br>
To my knowledge this doesn't have a fix yet, but there was some blue post saying they have enough info on the problem now, so probably expect a hotfix soon.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

1.) I respecced 17/0/54 after poor DW performance in first wing of Naxx.<br>
2.) I rezzed a player with the raise ally spell.<br>
<br>
After that I was bugged.  I don't know what the cause was.  I tried the following to remedy:<br>
<br>
1.) Selling my dust I had and buying new dust.<br>
2.) Using another DKs dust.<br>
3.) Went to town and glyphed for no reagent.<br>
4.) Killed my WTF/WDB folders.<br>
5.) respecced back to 0/33/38<br>
<br>
All leads me to the conclusion that it is just a bug with the spell on the server and Blizzard has the worst QA team of any corporation.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Granted, Malygos is currently bugged with what my guild affectionately calls "farts of doom" in which he breathes on the raid while casting Arcane Storm without facing the raid.<br>

Back on topic I had Glyph of Raise Dead before the patch was released and have not experienced the bug yet. However, at the time of the patch I had approximately 37 corpse dust on me which I gave to another Death Knight in my guild before we raided Naxxramas last night.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

If you're already impacted by the bug, summon a ghoul via a humanoid corpse and deathpact/dismiss it, and you should be good (untested). Alternatively, die in a battleground or lake wintergrasp; you should respawn unbugged with a ghoul active.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div class="intellitxt" id="post_message_1067959"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Couple things I would like to add. Seems AotD does not get the 70% reduced damage from aoe at all. Did a presummon on 4hmen, and were instantly killed. Same thing on Sapphiron. My ghoul was a champ though, taking less damage then me in aoe situations, and had my ghoul lived thru it. Ghoul can live thru sapph's breath, so I kept it in there. I also noticed my Gargoyle on Sapphiron lived thru entire duration, from either the half hp bug fix or aotd 70% reduction (not sure).<br>
<br>
Side Note: Ghoul living thru sapph breath was pretty hax. However, as soon as sapph lands, ghoul would end up behind sapph everytime getting tailswiped. So quick passive and attack fixes that. A quick DC and aoe raid healing took care of hp loss to ghoul during breath. <br>
<br>
Macro I use for DC:<br>

My biggest problem with Army of the Dead is, that those ghouls alway die within seconds after summoning which makes the 20 min cooldown a complete waste.<br>

Sidenote: AotD channeling time is not affected by BL - always 6 sec. I also wonder how AotD works with your stats: update all the time like Ghoul or do snapshot like Garg? Because if it acts like Garg then it would be smart to start pull with Unholy Presence, summon AotD and then switch to Blood, that would result in 15% more AotD melee damage in exchange of 1 blood rune.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Unless I miss-understand you, you're asking for an auto-cast on Gnaw ?<br>
<br>
But the current ghoul has an auto cast on gnaw.<br>
<br>
My personal setup for auto-casts is like this<br>
<br>
Solo: Claw / Gnaw on auto-cast, leap turned off (annoying when your ghoul leaps when you try to corner pull or deathgrip)<br>
Raid: Claw / Leap<br>
PvP: Claw / Leap (although i dont pvp much, so maybe leap is better of without auto cast as well)<br>

Since no one else seems willing to spend time doing any testing, I have. Skip to the bottom for the results:<br>
<br>
-----Boring stuff here--------<br>
<u>Method: </u><br>
Used Recount and recorded "total damage" "dps" and "pet time" for each trial. For each condition I performed at least 5 trials and averaged them together. Tests were performed on the lvl 80 training dummy in IF (since attacking the lvl 83 boss dummy seems to be some kind of invitation for random people to come debuff it, I had to stick with the lvl 80 dummy).  Stood 1 ft behind the dummy and did not move character for the entirety of testing, since ghoul summon locations are based around the caster. Done extremely late at night when there is no lag and no one is messing with the non-boss dummies.<br>
Spec was common 0/33/38 with IT, Ghoul, DnD major glyphs. NotD is bugged so that doing 10 PS will reduce the CD to 10min, then when you log out and back in, your next 10 PS will reduce the CD to 0 min. This allows for continuous testing.<br>

<u>Abbreviations:</u><br>
BP: blood presence<br>
UP: unholy presence<br>
M: mirror of truth proc (+1000 AP)<br>
FC: Fallen Crusader proc (+30% str)<br>
Ca: Greatness deck proc (+300 str)<br>
ITa: Icy Talons (+20% melee haste)<br>
SPot: Speed Pot (+15.25% haste)<br>
<br>
<br>
<u>Data:</u><br>
I found "dps" to be the most useful of the 3 variables that I recorded from Recount, so thats what I will be reporting for comparison. Remember, these are all the average of 5 trials unless noted otherwise.<br>
BP, no procs: 1346<br>
BP, ITa: 1471<br>
BP, FC, ITa: 1532<br>
BP, M, ITa: 1533<br>
BP, M, Ca, ITa: 1553<br>
BP, M, FC, ITa: 1607<br>
UP, no procs: 1450<br>
UP, SPot: 1556<br>
UP, ITa: 1643 (based on 12 trials due to large variation evident in first 3 trials)<br>
UP, SPot, ITa: 1769 (based on 10 trials)<br>
UP, SPot, FC, Ca, ITa: 1854<br>
UP, SPot, FC, M, ITa: 1952 (based on 3; too much shit to coordinate)<br>
<br>
Misc:<br>
naked except for weapons: 1059 (single trial)<br>
BP, ITa; no attacking while AotD is up: 1481<br>
BP, ITa; auto-attacking for duration so there are procs: 1476  (shows that AotD doesn't update stats once summoned; try your pet Ghoul, his dps is notably different depending on if you are auto-attacking or not due to procs)<br>
BP, ITA, no ghoul glyph: 1510 (single trial)<br>
<br>
<br>
<u>The Important Comparisons:</u><br>
<b>Haste: </b>In order from least to most haste<br>
BP: 1346                  (baseline)<br>
UA: 1450                  (+15% haste--&gt;+7.7% dmg)<br>
BP, ITa: 1471           (+20% haste--&gt; +9.3% dmg)<br>
UA, SPot: 1556         (+30.25% haste--&gt;+15.6% dmg)<br>
UA, ITa: 1643           (+35% haste--&gt; +22% dmg)<br>
UA, SPot, ITa: 1769   (+50.25% haste --&gt; +31%dmg)<br>
For the first three points, it looks like AotD is getting 1/2 of the haste. For the final two, it looks more like 3/5ths. Honestly, I don't care; point is that their damage is significantly increased by haste. Haven't been able to test heroism yet...<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>AP: </b>In order from least to most AP<br>
BP, ITa: 1471            (baseline, 3207 AP)<br>
BP, FC, ITa: 1532       (+758 AP--&gt; +4.1%)<br>
BP, M, ITa: 1533         (+1000 AP--&gt; +4.2%)<br>
BP, M, Ca, ITa: 1553   (+1630 AP--&gt; +5.6%)<br>
BP, M, FC, ITa: 1607    (+1758 AP--&gt; +9.2%)<br>
So AotD damage does increase with AP procs, but compared to gargoyle, its poor scaling.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
-----End of Boring stuff-------<br>
<br>
<u>Questions that have been answered:</u><br>
<i>Do AotD ghoul stats update continuously (as with pet Ghoul) or are they determined upon summoning (as with Gargoyle)?</i> Based on stats at summoning; as expected<br>
<i>Does AotD scale with gear?</i> Yes (a single trial naked makes it clear)<br>
<i>Does AotD scale with AP procs (such as Greatness deck, Fallen Crusader, and Mirror of Truth)?</i> Yes, although rather poorly compared to gargoyle.<br>
<i>Does AotD scale with haste buffs (such as Icy Talons, WF, and Haste Pot)?</i> Yes, they seem to receive maybe half of your haste.<br>
<i>Does AotD benefit from Unholy Presence?</i> Yes<br>
<i>Does AotD benefit from Glyph of the Ghoul? </i>No <br>
<br>
<br>
<u>Questions left to be answered:</u><br>
Does AotD get any benefit from heroism? Does heroism need to be before or after summoning?<br>
Does AotD get the haste benefit if summoned when a WF totem is down?<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Maximizing AotD dmg:<br>
<u>Ideal situation:</u> Late in the fight; all three procs are up, heroism is out, use Empower, switch to unholy, use speed pot, summon gargoyle, summon AotD; boss lives for at least 45s. The AotD boost will probably outweigh the 6 secs you stop attacking, but it won't be by much; really not worth it in my opinion, considering everything that would have to be juggled.<br>
<u>Realistic situation:</u> 4 seconds pre-pull, while in UP, with Enh sham's WF down (not yet confirmed, but assumed), pop speed pot, channel AotD. Since OoC when potion is taken, it will CD and can be used later in the fight with Gargoyle and heroism. You lose the dmg of 1 BS switching back to BP, but gain it back through AotD buff.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>1) Unbuffed Garg do ~13 hits (for me), I had friendly shammy BL me and it did 16 hits - I used Garg after BL. Given that AotD seems to follow same rules you should summon both during BL. <br>
<br>
BL -&gt; wait for AP/FC proc -&gt; UP -&gt; Garg -&gt; AotD -&gt; BP<br>
That should be best. Using UP solely for Garg is most likely not worth it.<br>

</div>I've heard no one mention: AotD ghouls melee *and* claw. Ostensibly claw is unaffected by haste (and rather by an ability cooldown (they don't have energy bars)). I just began looking at wowmeteronline patchwerk AotD damage, and noticed melee is about 60% of the damage. I then noticed that wowmeteronline gets confused if two DKs use AotD on one fight (i.e., patchwerk).<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, you could probably make this analysis more complete by comparing AotD melee damage to AotD claw damage gains from haste.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

A few people in my guild were worried they would cause the pet bug but don't worry they will all be dead or die with vortex.(had two armies attacking).<br>
<br>
Next time im going to try after a vortex with two sparks down....see how that fairs out. Given that you have a few seconds of down time after vortex you won't lose as much DPS as you normally would.<br>
<br>
On 3 Drakes AotD worked great too. If you summon AotD right as the first drake lands and gets into position you will get the full AotD uptime before they start falling off from flame waves etc. <br>
<br>
The only down side is that they will taunt adds off your add tanks which takes away some DPS from drake 1 but it does give some avoidence to your add tanks. So it can't hurt.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Thanks for the response.<br>
<br>
Another question...<br>
<br>
Regarding gargoyle and bloodlust, is it better to pop gargoyle just before you get bloodlust (so that it in theory gains the bloodlust directly), or pop it just after getting bloodlust (thereby indirectly gaining bloodlust's benefit when it "snapshots" my stats)?<br>
<br>
Some comments in this thread seem to infer that gargoyle should come after bloodlust.  However, in the unholy DPS thread some have suggested that gargoyle should come before bloodlust.<br>
<br>
I'm just wondering if anybody has checked this.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

This may have to do with the fact that Garg displays as a debuff on the enemy so DoTimer doesn't care about the ability itself, just the debuff timer.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Well honestly that wasn't what I was addressing.  I know that it got from increased survivability from NotD- that has been my experience as well- it usually survives almost the entirety of Naxx.  That specifically is why the other night seemed so strange, and why I thought it prudent to post the experience.<br>
<br>
Thank you guys that have said that you haven't noticed any problems over the past couple of days, it's possible that I just had an unlucky run.  Haven't been able to get back on to try again, so hopefully it goes more "normally" in the future, lol...<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>You need to use your Haste potion before summoning (just macro it in). AotD doesn't update stats post-summoning (personally tested) and neither does gargoyle (assumed). <br>
<br>
My recommendation is:<br>
pre-pull: unholy presence, haste pot (out of combat), Horn of Winter up, WF totem down early (have to personally bug a shaman to get it), AotD channel while boss is being pulled; switch back to blood after channel<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">You need to use your Haste potion before summoning (just macro it in). AotD doesn't update stats post-summoning (personally tested) and neither does gargoyle (assumed). <br>
<br>
My recommendation is:<br>
pre-pull: unholy presence, haste pot (out of combat), Horn of Winter up, WF totem down early (have to personally bug a shaman to get it), AotD channel while boss is being pulled; switch back to blood after channel<br>
Save gargoyle for heroism (most guilds pop it for the last 35% or so, depending on fight duration), combined with haste pot (hopefully cooled) and any procs you can wait for (assuming boss will live for 30s more).</div>

<br>
I am a Blood DK, so not specced into perma-ghoul.  All the testing thus far has been done on permanent ghouls, but what about their lesser brethren?  Does my ghoul get all the benefits of all the theorycrafting has entailed?<br>
<br>
i.e. - Does bringing out my ghoul when everything procs just right benefit me more?  I would assume so since I am specced into Ravenous Dead.<br>
<br>
Does pet food benefit a temp-ghoul?<br>
<br>
And this may be more of a noobish question, but let's say I summon my ghoul while Unholy Strength and my other procs are up - When my procs fade, does the ghoul's stats go down to?  Or do they keep their stats that they have when they are summoned?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I'm personally kind of interested in its working with Bloodlust, I stated earlier (as seen in the Original post) that there is a strong possibility that gargoyle can't gain bloodlust when GG is already up, but that rather it gets part of the haste you receive from bloodlust, at the moment you summon GG.<br>
<br>
Whether this is really true or false is still to be determined.<br>
<br>
Another remarkable thing is that the gargoyle has 2 "phases".<br>
When you press summon, your gargoyle is summoned immediately (from what I've seen in the logs), however you don't actually gain the "Summon Gargoyle" buff until 10 seconds after it is summoned. <br>
Does this 10 second have any special function ?<br>
Do buffs apply differently because of this 10 seconds ?<br>

If the second is indeed true, than bloodlust just works indirectly through the DK I guess. DK gets 40% haste, gargoyle copies that haste for its own use.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div class="intellitxt" id="post_message_1125866" style="min-height: 183px;"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->A compilation of Death Knight suggested changes:  The Master of Ghouls talent should be removed, and made baseline; with the following suggestions...<br>
<br>
Raise Dead<br>
<br>
The Raise Dead spell could be easily changed to a 10 second cast, similar to the Warlock summoning spells, and the regent removed.  This change could then be used to alter the Glyph of Raise Dead to allow 70-100% interrupt resistance.<br>
<br>
The next glyph this would affect is Glyph of the Ghoul; and this glyph could be changed to 'Increases the Attack Power of a Ghoul pet by 10%.'<br>
<br>
New spell:<br>
<br>
Dominate Dead<br>
FFUUBB<br>
Channeled<br>
Casting time: 20 seconds<br>
<br>
This spell is basically turned into a 'Tame Beast' for Death Knights.  It allows the 'taming' or more accurately 'dominating' of an Undead-type creature.  Certain Undead-types could be broken up into three groups, being Ghoul, Skeleton, or Banshee.<br>
<br>
This ends up being a cross between the Warlock and Hunter pet styles.  You don't need a 'Raise Dead' option because you simply re-summon your pet just as a Warlock might, and locking in names just as Warlock pets have consistently the same name.  The other aspect is that a Death Knight can dominate an Undead-type and replace the default Ghoul with a different pet skin/subclass.<br>
<br>
Ideally Death Knights wouldn't have stable access, making the pet-choice a little harder since it would be an inherent design limitation purposefully implemented to promote pet variety in both what pet-skins were used and what role they served as.<br>
<br>
Another option for the Master of Ghouls talent might be to retain it, and let is serve as a requirement to access 'Stable' slots, as a true 'Master of Ghouls' one might be able to control them even when not present.<br>
<br>
I would suggest the three primary classes of pet sub-type be divided into the three proposed categories in order to give them specific family skills for the intended purpose they would each have.  For example, the Ghoul subclass could be the Generic/PVP pet; while the Banshee might be the 'ranged' pet; similar to the purpose a Warlock's Imp serves, while the Skeleton might be the more focused PVE/DPS-style pet.<br>
<br>
The option to Dismiss a pet would be separate with another command similar to Hunters allowing one to 'Release' a pet forever, and restore your default Ghoul when the Raise Dead spell is cast while the Death Knight has no special pet 'equipped' or Dominated through use of a Release command or by removing it to the Stable.<br>
<br>
Avoidance would need to be made baseline, as with Warlock pets, but these changes allow for more bonuses to be moved to the Undead-pet from the Death Knight in the first place.  For instance, the Haste copying affect from the Ghouls now could be replaced with copying the Death Knights resistances, STR, STM, and perhaps even Armor based on a portion of the Death Knight statistics.<br>
<br>
These changes allow Ghouls to be considered a more regular aspect of the Death Knight, and I feel fits more in flavor with how Death Knights have been treated in the past and gives them a unique niche.  This gives the game 2 ranged pet classes, one each of physical and magic damage, and a third pet class designed for melee use with a mix of both damage types.<br>
<br>
This then moves us on to the talent trees themselves...<br>
<br>
Unholy could be reworked slightly in order to basically make it slightly more in line with the Demonology/Beast Mastery-style talent tree.  Frost could be mainly left alone, and the Blood tree could be given more emphasis to make it more of the Single Target/AOE damage-style tree, so that when different style of Death Knight were talented for DPS they could balance out, but get their DPS through different styles with slightly different abilities.<br>
<br>
The Unholy tree would probably require the most adjustment, but even then only a few talents would need to be changed.  Such as changing Desecration to affect pet damage, and changing Night of the Dead to perhaps still lower the 'cool-down' period on 'Army of the Dead' and have an alternate side-effect of improving pet damage by 5/10%.<br>
<br>
Another option then for handling abilities currently in place might be to just remove them and make them pet-types.  For example, the Gargoyle skill talent could be removed and replaced with the ability to tame Gargoyles, which aren't technically Undead.  Then since the Gargoyle is a permanent pet-type now it can be more easily balanced with other pet types to make it function several roles, perhaps as a Ranged version of the PVE/PVP pet, in some respects like the 'Felguard' does for the<br>
Warlock class.<br>
<br>
I was trying to post this in the WoW Suggestions Forums, but those things are broken beyond repair, and I can't get them to work long enough to post so...  Whatever, right?<br>
<br>
Anything I missed?  Feedback?  I realize ideas aren't likely to see the light of day, but if it puts a bug in somebodies ear it's probably worth the effort.  Also, if somebody wouldn't mind posting this for me where I was trying to get it that wouldn't be bad either.  Not sure why I can't get them to work, but meh, easy come easy go, I guess.<br>
<br>

</div>I like a lot of the suggestions here.  But I also enjoy how entirely unique our class is.  I was disappointed when they took the cd changes from Army of the Dead, and Raise Ghoul, and would like to see those re-implemented.  I also like the idea of dominating the undead.  But I don't really like the idea of following the hunter path.  I think maybe something where the critter you take over becomes a minion that mindlessly attacks what you are attacking, for a set duration, with diminishing returns (not that trash mobs live long enough to suffer that).  I don't think I'd like that to be in the talent tree, but rather something trainable, tied to an Unholy tier requirement.<br>
<br>
Back on "live" pet tracks, I've googled, experimented, and searched the website to no avail.  Does anyone have a functioning 'splode corpse macro with a modifier to target your ghoul?   Blowing him up in the boss fights does wonders for add control...But having to target him, blow him up, then manually retarget is a PITA.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div class="intellitxt" id="post_message_1126930"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I should probably add that when I'm talking about changing the Ghoul to be something more like Hunters and Warlocks I'm referring the the old old old school Hunters from when the game first came out.  Nothing like what we have today.  I don't think Death Knights revolve around pets, nor should they, the same way a Hunter does.<br>
<br>
Having a permanent pet the way Warlocks do as baseline though gives the devs another method by which to balance Death Knight damage output without directly affecting the way our damage scales too much with gear increases, so the DPS changes could more easily be baseline.<br>
<br>
Not to mention the fact that pets are an awesome mechanic in general, and there is a large portion, even the majority, of DK's that are specced into Unholy just for the permanent pet.  That's one of the reasons, I'm told, that they lowered the talent cost requirement for a permanent pet in the first place, to hopefully get fewer people so heavily vested into Unholy and see more variety in the talent trees.<br>
<br>
Pesonally, I'm leaning towards going with Death Strike DPS with a Ghoul pet using 51/0/20, or maybe 51/2/18 or something like that after 3.1, but maybe that's just me.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>In response to this post and as a suggestion to the "Fact"-Zone of the lead-post, I have recently observed that the AotD-Ghuls can be commanded about...kinda.<br>
They follow the commands given to your ghoul, if you have one. I wasn't able to test all of it but this much I can say for sure:<br>
As we all know when you popp the army without any enemy around, they'll just rally around your character, doing nothing. However if you, say, target a dummy and command your ghoul to attack your ghoul aswell as the army will charge. If you have leap on autocast, the army will also leap. If you don't they will run there like your ghoul.<br>
Now if you target a different dummy and command your ghoul to attack your ghoul will attack but the army will remain hitting the first target. This can be circumvented by first commanding your ghoul to follow you again. In that case the ghoul will come trodding back to you with the army at his heels. Only then can you target another dummy and successfully make your army attack it. <br>
I also noticed that the army doesn't just follow the ghoul when you command him via the petbar, but also if you use macros. I then tried to command the army about with macros without my ghoul around but unsuccesfull. They seem to be dependent on the ghoul.<br>
Now having noticed this it suddenly appears so obvious that I think many other players will have also noticed this behaviour. However I haven't read anything about it in this thread and I find this knowledge extremy useful.<br>
I myself for example have been struggling to cast an army of the dead on sarth 3d without having them attack some random firespawn. Now I just spam petfollow until the drake is attackable and then petattack to have alle my ghouls jump him.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
However, I would think it would be really hard to command army due to them being "aggressive" all the time.  If they do come to you when you hit follow, you'd have to immediately follow it up with a command to attack a particular target to get them to do what you want it seems, or just spam follow as you posted.<br>
<br>
I don't know if that's amazingly beneficial, but it's certainly worth noting.  If there were more confirmed tests on this to see what commands they do follow and what commands they don't follow, it'd be much better to update the main thread with that info.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Well if I had to structure the information it'd probably look like this:<br>
1. AotD is always aggressive<br>
2. If the ghoul gets the command to follow, AotD will imitate him<br>
3. If the ghoul gets the command to attack a target, AotD will attack that same target if they don't already have one<br>
4. If the ghoul leaps, AotD will also leap<br>
<br>
At this point I'm wondering wether AotD claws the enemy only when the ghoul claws it. I am fairly certain that they have this ability since I've seen it in my recountdata however I've never checked wether it was listed when I had Claw toggled off. The same is true for the other abilities aswell.<br>
.<br>
.<br>
.<br>
I actually just went and used one cooldown on the Ptr to check up on Claw. The result is that AotD claws the enemy even when your ghoul does not. But they only leap a target if the ghould does (or could? I don't know yet.).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
AotD ghouls will leap on their own. With my ghoul on passive and all the autocasts turned off, running around body pulling a bunch of mobs results in AotD ghouls charging the first target with most of them leaping at it. I'm pretty sure all you're seeing is the behavior of a goofy AI on a pet choosing to use an ability with a cooldown. They also cast Claw on their own, though you've already corrected that statement.<br>
<br>
Basically, the only one to check is that following issue.<br>
<br>
Edit: To clarify, I believe the only reason you're seeing them follow you is that you're (presumably) dropping combat with the dummy. You're seeing them leap because their leap is off cd and they want to. You aren't controlling them.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I did the following test. I stood infront of the herodummy in Ebon Hold. I pulled my army and ordered my ghoul to attack. Everything charges. /petfollow and they all retreat. /petattack and they attack again. /petfollow and they retreat etc etc.<br>
And I did the same with Sartharion 3d.<br>
When a wave came I ran to the safezone and spammed petfollow to rescue my ghoul. And all the AotD-ghouls followed.<br>
What you are observing as "sometimes they'll come back" is probably a ghoul running back at you as you hit /petfollow but attacking again before having reached you. This often happens when a disease ticks or some other random event takes place. <br>
<br>
As for leap which you mentioned one post before; it may well be that they leap if they assign a target on their own. But if they follow the permaghouls orders they only leap when he does.<br>
Tested this on dummy aswell. As the permaghoul leaps, everybody does. If the permaghoul doesnt leap, nobody does. Pretty conclusive to me.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I set my pet to passive with leap set to manual and used AotD four or five times over an hour or so of fishing. Every time I sent my ghoul at a mob, the army would follow and some number of them would leap, despite my ghoul not leaping.

I also wasn't attacking mobs directly, just running around with a fishing pole on sending my ghoul at the wolvar mobs in the area, having it pick up half a dozen or so while the army destroyed them. Calling the pet back while the army was engaged never resulted in 100% of the army disengaging, despite the ghoul being on passive, being called back to my side and no other damage being involved (which probably shouldn't matter on defensive anyway).

</div>You have to consider that the army is always aggressive, even when the ghoul is not. So some of the army leaping and some not may be caused by some of them attacking on themselves due to the aggressive stance. If they do that they'll leap. The others may have not caught up on the target until you sent your ghoul at the target and thus dindn't leap.<br>
This is just guessing of course and I wasn't there to see for myself, however I have a hard time believing that blizzard made the army do things at random.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Claw: 414<br>
Total swings: 1236<br>
Misses: 7 <b>(0.9%)</b><br>

This would seem to indicate that the ghoul's hit is indeed rounded down so that he is at 7.00% no matter whether the master is at 7.01% or 7.99%.<br>

What I'm not sure of is how much of a DPS loss that is likely to be. I would guess it is going to be worth me swapping a few gems around though -- prismatic from boots into bracers seems most obvious.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div class="intellitxt" id="post_message_1194578"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'm not sure if this is common knowledge, but the gargoyle currently seems to be bugged to last only 30 seconds, as opposed to the 40 seconds implied by the tooltip.  I tested it multiple times on dummies in Orgrimmar, summoning gargoyle at both 50, 100 and 130 RP.  For reference, I timed the gargoyle duration by starting the stopwatch as soon as I summoned the gargoyle.  After the first "free" 10 seconds, the gargoyle buff appeared, with a duration of 20 seconds for a total of 30 seconds.  Runic power was kept near max for the duration.<br>

Throughout all of Ulduar the little sucker dies way too often compared to t7 instances. Much more timing is involved on when to summon your oversized bat. I even noticed that he's doing some arbitrary position changes now like flying into Mimiron's laser AE and dieing instantly. The short sequences between massive AE stuff makes it hard enough to keep him alive more than 15s there. Vezax and Yogg are no trouble though.<br>

<br>
For razorscale I usually pop it right when our "harpoon person" calls for when he is about to pop him down at the 50% mark.  That way by the time they're all up razorscale is the target.  And besides the adds are going to die anyway within seconds so it won't matter if one or two taunts off the adds on the tank.<br>
<br>
For Ignis I for one don't use army because if by chance they taunt those golems your tanks are going to be really pissed because it is already hard enough to get them to stay in the fire.<br>
<br>
XT I pop them about few seconds before the heart appears (in between his getting tired speech).<br>
<br>
Iron Council I pop them on the big guy.<br>
<br>
Kologran I use them at the beginning of the fight to zerg the right arm.<br>
<br>
Crazy Cat Woman - Really have no chance of using it.  If you use it at the beginning and get the tanks killed thats bad.  In the middle if they taunt the cat into the middle of the raid and it dies thats bad too.<br>
<br>
Hodir - I haven't really use it there since I assume they'd die but I'll test it out this coming week.<br>
I think I can probably pop it at beginnign to kill the frozen people.<br>
<br>
Thorim - can pop it right after he lands down.<br>
<br>
Freya - Really have no chance of using it.  With the snaplasher 1 shotting our tank if something goes wrong I don't even want to try this.  Might be able to pop it at beginning and make it zerg Freya just for kicks.<br>
<br>
Mimiron - I use it in between phase 3 and 4 just for more dips.  I guess you can use it during phase 3 to get the assembly bots but phase 3 is so easy I'd rather save it for phase 4 for a tad bit more dips on the actual boss.<br>
<br>
Vezax - I just use it at the beginning.<br>
<br>
Yogg - Maybe during phase 3 when you can make all of them attack the brain ...maybe.<br>
<br>
Algalon - No Idea.<br>
<br>
PS:  I have a quick question about Ghoul Frenzy.  I've been testing it out using Icy touch and Ghoul Frenzy whenever it is needed and or Blood Tap and Ghoul Frenzy.  I have the rotation down pretty well but sometimes I admit I do mess it up and it does kill the whole rotation for quite some time.  I'm still debating on whether to use it or not.  I've been reading and the forum says that GF is a dps increase (can some1 point me to the math post about it?) but it does sometimes kills my rotation and I just want to see the math behind doing Ghoul Frenzy on my ghoul.  Gotta know if GF + Icy Touch is better than a SS and add in a DC most likely.<br>
<br>
And also please don't factor in the life regen for the pet because he never dies.  Well the only fight that he ever died on was Mimiron but that is because I'm too busy looking at mines and rockets to care about him.  Worst comes to worst I can just resummon him.  I just only want to look at it through a DPS value if having 25% increase to ghoul attacks worth it or not.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I see a lot of people in this thread suggest using AotD mid-fight; isn't i a dps loss? In my understanding best way of use is pre-pull, or on phase transitions (Mimiron being nice example). Freya 'burn' phase would be totaly bad example of using AotD as not only you loose dps while channeling, you probably will be standing close to those green exploding things and you'll have to catch up with boss since she's being kited away.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I see a lot of people in this thread suggest using AotD mid-fight; isn't i a dps loss? In my understanding best way of use is pre-pull, or on phase transitions (Mimiron being nice example). Freya 'burn' phase would be totaly bad example of using AotD as not only you loose dps while channeling, you probably will be standing close to those green exploding things and you'll have to catch up with boss since she's being kited away.</div>

	</tbody></table>
</div>The last AotD I used on Freya did 75,407 damage for a 6 second cast.  Maybe Im completely off base, but I doubt we can do ~75,000 damage ourselves in 6 seconds.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">PS:  I have a quick question about Ghoul Frenzy.  I've been testing it out using Icy touch and Ghoul Frenzy whenever it is needed and or Blood Tap and Ghoul Frenzy.  I have the rotation down pretty well but sometimes I admit I do mess it up and it does kill the whole rotation for quite some time.  I'm still debating on whether to use it or not.  I've been reading and the forum says that GF is a dps increase (can some1 point me to the math post about it?) but it does sometimes kills my rotation and I just want to see the math behind doing Ghoul Frenzy on my ghoul.  Gotta know if GF + Icy Touch is better than a SS and add in a DC most likely.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>I did some math on it, but that was with pre-3.1 numbers where it showed it as a dps increase. I think people are still using that.<br>
<br>
There is an ongoing discussion about it in the unholy thread atm though.<br>
<br>
The thing is, in my opinion you should not view Ghoul Frenzy as a pure dps button more so than a utility, other than a point in necrosis there are few alternatives and ghoul frenzy is really useful in situations like:<br>
<br>
- Right before a pull<br>
- When your ghoul takes damage now and again (mimiron phase 2 comes to mind; maybe on Iron council  too)<br>
- When there is a dead moment in the fight where you are out of range (Hodir's flash freezes come to mind)<br>
- When strategical burst is required (right before XT's heart phase comes to mind)<br>
<br>
You can use it with blood tap as well, although i tend to save that for emergencies (sometimes my death runes mess up), and for bone shield.<br>
<br>
If you have some WWS reports for me of a good (preferably somewhat static) fight without many (if any) modifiers, so i can see what your average SS / DC / Ghoul white dps numbers are, i can calculate the actual dps benefit for you.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I thought about that, I'll go ahead and add a note on it.<br>
<br>
Also appreciate the comments Consider, I'll make the changes.  As a note on that, I've gone back through and changed all the descriptions on when to use AotD to an advised timing for each fight so that it can be used on all fights, instead of a (+/-) system that was used before depending on the boss.  There are still a few fights where AotD probably shouldn't be used, and I've tried to note that, but I'm welcome to suggestions if people feel the advice is bad.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div class="intellitxt" id="post_message_1376546"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I disagree on Anub'arak. Here are my thoughts on ToTC AoTD usage. <br>
<br>
Northrend Beasts<br>
- Gormok the Impaler: Can be used as encounter begins, so they die before snobolds come out. Even if snobolds are taunted, that's perfectly fine too.<br>
- Twin Jormungars: Can be used as encounter begins. Recommended to take down Acidmaw quickly.<br>
- Icehowl: Can be used as encounter begins or when Icehowl is stunned. The boss has a melee knockback and the stun is fairly short, so this is not recommended.<br>
<br>
Lord Jaraxxus<br>
- Can be used as the encounter begins so they die as the infernals/mistresses spawn. Recommended.<br>
<br>
Faction Champions<br>
- Can be used with the FoK AE strategy, but this strategy will not work in 3.2.2. Not recommended.<br>
<br>
Anub'Arak<br>
- Use AoTD when Anub'arak is at 31% for the phase three DPS burn. Very strongly recommended.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Good thoughts.  I've posted most of what I found for information on AotD at the top of the thread, including what has been found for optimal situation use on most bosses (except for ToC, which I'll be posting shortly once I have another run on hardmodes).<br>
<br>
Not to take away from the work people have done in the other thread, but I would think it best if we just had one consolidated pet thread for all pet information, so that members only have to check one thread to find out the information they need on pets (which is why I've also been trying to update the OP as much as I can lately).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>
