With PTR patch 3.3.3 now being tested, it's once again time for change.<br>
<br>
Notes of interest to Unholy PvE DPS:<ul><li>Endless Winter: No longer causes Frost Fever to be applied by Chains of Ice, but instead grants 2/4% strength.</li>
<li>Icy Talons: The personal haste benefit provided by this talent is no longer exclusive with other sources of melee haste. This will allow death knights to always swing 4/6/12/16/20% faster when Frost Fever is applied. Windfury Totem and the party/raid component of Improved Icy Talons still do not stack.</li>
<li>Scourge Strike: Now deals 70% weapon damage, plus 12% of physical damage done as shadow damage for each of the death knight's diseases on the target. The net result should be larger strikes with no diseases present, while maximum damage with all diseases applied to the target should stay the same.</li>
</ul><br>
At first glance, the SS change may seem like the most important of them all. With the physical strike going from 50% to 70% of weapon damage and the magical strike being reduced from 75% to 36% of the physical damage, surely that means something, right? No, not really. Blizzard actually managed to change our core ability to increase PvP potency without really any adverse effect to our PvE performance. Who knew such a thing could be managed! It does actually increase the damage of SS ever so slightly (about ~3%), but it's hardly worth noting, and doesn't actually change our spec, stat weights, or gearing.<br>
<br>
The changes to the Frost tree, on the other hand, <i>do</i> mix up our spec, weights, and gearing. The reason why is due to the increased attractiveness of a Frost sub-spec as opposed to a Blood sub-spec.<br>
<br>
But after it was buffed so much, how can passing up Subversion possibly result in a dps increase? <br>
How can taking BI, when less of SS's damage will be affected, possibly be worth it? <br>
<i>By dropping Reaping.</i> <br>
<br>
It breaks down as follows:<br>
Sub-Frost + Reapingless &gt; Sub-Blood + Reaping &gt; Sub-Blood + Reapingless &gt; Sub-Frost + Reaping<br>
<br>
Frost Reapingless pulls ahead of Blood Reaping by about 50 dps. It's certainly possible that the latter will pull ahead in BiS, but it does have a decent gap to cover, especially when you consider the majority of tests were already using a 277 weapon, and the weapon was the largest factor in whether or not one took Reaping.<br>
<br>
At any rate, the exact build will be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100228222358/http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?deathknight#flc-n68QFeGyqM,qpF,11599" target="_blank">0/17/54</a>. The glyphs are intentional: GoBS pulls ahead of GoDD by about 5 dps. GoDD will still be superior in most cases, simply due to RP via Revitalize/AMS, but GoBS is an option worth noting.<br>
<br>
Theorycrafting is still ongoing, and stat weights/BiS lists will be posted once things are more certain.<br>
<br>
As always, this entire section is subject to change, as it is the PTR.<br>

</u>Why do it?<br>
<br>
Why spec Unholy when you could go Blood which claims to hold superior (or, at the least, equivalent) single target sustained dps,  superior single target burst, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100228222358/http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=49016" target="_blank">Hysteria</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100228222358/http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=53138" target="_blank">Abomination's Might</a> to its name?<br>
<br>
Why spec Unholy when you could go Frost which claims to hold equivalent single target sustained dps, superior AoE burst, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100228222358/http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=55610" target="_blank">Improved Icy Talons</a>, and a more dynamic rotation to its name?<br>
<br>
Why?<br>
<br>
This question is vital to the understanding of anything in this thread. After all, if there were no reason to spec Unholy over the alternatives, why would this thread even exist?<br>
<br>
Fortunately, Unholy has more than its fair share of upsides, thus it's an easy argument to make. The more notable advantages of Unholy include:<ul><li><b>Superior Sustained AoE Dps</b><br>
Unholy is, unarguably, the strongest spec in the game at this role. No one - caster or melee - can top an Unholy DK on any fight with significant AoE, not if the DK knows his stuff. The lead in this area isn't a matter of a couple percent; it's quite significant (varying on the exact number of mobs - the more, the larger the gap becomes). With the previous tier of content being heavily AoE-centric, this virtue came to shine and gave the spec its claim to fame. Although AoE isn’t quite as omnipresent in ICC as it was in TotC/TotGC, it’s still important on a number of fights.<br></li>
<li><b>Superior Sustained Single Target Dps</b><br>
Up until the current patch, Unholy’s one greatest weakness had always been sustained single target dps. It had been the flaw in an otherwise near perfect spec. With the reworking <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100228222358/http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=55271" target="_blank">Scourge Strike</a> received, this is no longer the case. Unholy can keep up with – and surpass, in the current tier – both Blood and Frost in this area. <br></li>
<li><b>Superior Raid Utility</b><br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100228222358/http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=53138" target="_blank">Abomination's Might</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100228222358/http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=55610" target="_blank">Improved Icy Talons</a>, although obviously excellent, can be provided by other classes and other specs with the exact same potency. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100228222358/http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=51726" target="_blank">Ebon Plague</a>, on the other hand, cannot be. Warlocks and Moonkin cannot provide their magic damage debuffs on multiple targets at the same time - not without incredible hardship and the sacrifice of their entire personal dps (or a majority thereof). What more is that <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100228222358/http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=51726" target="_blank">Ebon Plague</a> does something <i>no other class or spec in the game can do</i>: It increases disease damage by 30% - a significant amount. If your raid contains at least two DKs, one being you, it is always worth it for one to go Unholy for EP alone, even if you ignore the other strengths of the spec. Not only that, but with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100228222358/http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=48300" target="_blank">Devouring Plague</a> being 10-15% of a shadow priest's damage, it's 3-5% more additional dps for them. EP is often underestimated and simply clumped together with CoE/EM, when it provides huge benefits which those two debuffs do not. It’s a must for almost any raid.<br></li>
<li><b>Superior Survivability</b><br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100228222358/http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=49222" target="_blank">Bone Shield</a> provides a near-passive 20% damage reduction. That's 20% less damage from every single AoE, every single nuke, every single add melee hit you take - everything. It's highly underrated, but can be the difference between life and death in a million and one situations. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100228222358/http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=55233" target="_blank">Vampiric Blood</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100228222358/http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=51271" target="_blank">Unbreakable Armor</a>, although excellent from a tanking point of view, don't compare for dpsers. Both are active cooldowns which cost you dps to use. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100228222358/http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=49222" target="_blank">Bone Shield</a> is essentially passive and grants you dps.</li>
</ul><br>
The fact of the matter is, speccing Unholy makes you unique. It provides you with tools which no other class or spec can bring. It provides you with dps in an area (AoE) which no other spec can hope to reach.  Everything Blood* and Frost bring to the table, on the other hand - be it their raid buffs, their single target dps, their survivability, their playstyles, whatever - can be matched or, in several cases, surpassed by others in a raid – often by the Unholy DK itself.<br>
<br>
In the world of increasing homogenization, this fact makes Unholy one of the most "different" specs around today and, as such, it becomes one of the most valuable. The same cannot be said about Blood or Frost.<br>
<br>
Whether you choose to spec it or not, is completely up to you. Blood and Frost are obviously not worthless and, depending on your typical raid composition and current level of progression, may in fact be ideal. It all depends on your personal circumstances, and there honestly is no right or wrong answer - at least not one which can be provided by others, only by yourself. <br>
<br>
The point is: Unholy is more than worthy of its raid spot. Anything to the contrary is utterly incorrect, be it coming from some random forum troll, a fellow guildmate, or an ignorant Blood/Frost DK.  <br>

<i>With this latest patch and hot-fix to Scourge Strike, there are a couple truly viable spec, which are listed below. Unholy Dual Wielding is no longer considered competitive – although it didn’t lose dps with this patch, it simply didn’t gain near as much as 2H builds did. Improved Unholy Presence specs *did* lose dps with this patch, and as such fell to the wayside. </i><br>
<br>
<b>[Single Target]</b><br>
<i><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100228222358/http://www.wowhead.com/?talent#jfVMVZZfM0Ixcdg0zx0uIqo:LsbMmV" target="_blank">17/0/54 without Reaping</a></i> <br>
The most optimal single target build before 2P T10 and/or several pieces of ICC gear. With the moderate buff to Scourge Strike along with the reworking of GoIT, ten second rotations are a thing of the past as Epidemic is once again most optimal. Reaping, on the other hand, doesn’t quite win out before the aforementioned gear level. Even with the secondary shadow portion of Scourge Strike being unable to crit, a Blood subspec is still vastly superior to a Frost variant – as although Scourge Strike now does more damage, less of its damage is shadow than the various version (when we still didn’t take Black Ice). Otherwise, the spec is fairly self-explanatory. Your auto-attack will be the highest percent of your total damage, followed by your Scourge Strike and then your Ghoul. Scourge Strike will be your hardest hitting individual ability, followed distantly by Death Coil and its subsequent Unholy Blight. <br>
<br>
<i><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100228222358/http://www.wowhead.com/?talent#jfVMMZZfM0Ixcdg0ux0uIqo:LsbMmV" target="_blank">14/0/57 with Reaping</a></i><br>
Once you attain 2P T10 and/or several pieces of ICC gear, Scourge Strike scales upward enough to make Reaping a dps gain once again, making this build the most optimal for single targets. With Dark Conviction being the weakest talent on a single target, the points for Reaping are taken from there. Aside from that, this spec is identical to the one already mentioned. Your Scourge Strike will be the highest percent of your total damage, followed by your auto-attack and then your Ghoul. Scourge Strike will be your hardest hitting individual ability, followed distantly by Death Coil and its subsequent Unholy Blight.<br>
<br>
<b>[Multiple Target / AoE]</b> <br>
<i><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100228222358/http://www.wowhead.com/?talent#jfVMVZZfMbIhcdg0zx0uIqo:psoMmV&quot;" target="_blank">17/0/54 without Reaping</a></i> <br>
The most optimal multi-target / AoE build . Compared to its single target variation, it simply sacrficices points from Necrosis to fill out Morbidity, due to the huge gain of the DnD cooldown. The damage loss is rather minor on single target encounters relative to the large amount of damage gained on multiple target / AoE encounters, and as such if you don’t have the luxury of using your dual spec for two dps specs, this could be considered the superior “general” spec. Your auto-attack will be the highest percent of your total damage, followed by your Scourge Strike and then your Ghoul. Scourge Strike will be your hardest hitting individual ability, followed distantly by Death Coil and its subsequent Unholy Blight.<br>

<i>Although this spec does not have any free floating points to spend on whatever you choose, one can take points from  Dark Conviction, the weakest single target dps talent, or from Necrosis, the weakest multi-target dps talent, at a relatively minor dps loss in favor of the utility provided by other talents:</i><ul><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100228222358/http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=63560" target="_blank">Ghoul Frenzy</a> – This talent should only be taken if you have trouble keeping your Ghoul alive. If you do, it becomes invaluable, as a dead Ghoul is a large portion of your dps down the drain (due to 30 seconds of absolutely zero Ghoul damage, followed by your Ghoul doing reduced damage for the remainder of the fight from missing buffs). If you don’t have issues with your pet going down, then skip this talent. In nearly every case it will be a strict dps loss.<br></li>
<li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100228222358/http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=50392" target="_blank">Improved Unholy Presence</a> –Unholy Presence is occasionally taken in Blood Presence builds solely for the run speed increase, which some consider worth the sacrifice. How much of a dps boost the run speed increase itself is is very difficult to calculate. The value varies drastically from fight to fight. The best option to determine its worth is to try it out yourself, see if you notice a difference and, if you do, decide whether or not it is worth the two talent point. There is no right and wrong answer as to whether or not one should spec into IUP.</li>

The major glyphs are set in stone for Unholy. No matter which of the “optional” talents you take, no matter what gear level you are currently at, no matter what tier of content you are currently progressing through, no matter whether or not you take Reaping, you’ll use the same three glyphs depending on if the encounter is primarily single target or multiple target. <br>
<br>
The same goes for the multi-target glyphs.<br>
<br>
It’s important to note that as of this patch, Glyph of Disease will no longer cause Pestilence to ‘roll’ the AP value present when you applied diseases. Instead, whenever you case Pestilence to refresh them, diseases will look at your current value of AP (and then use that number until you cast Pestilence again). As such, one doesn’t have to worry about lining up trinket procs at the start of the encounter. This makes GoD non-competitive for a single target, but still a must for a multiple target encounter.<br>
<br>
None of the minor glyphs will have any large impact on your dps, so which you choose is largely up to you. Glyph of Pestilence is the one exception – although it won’t increase your dps on paper or in a simulator, a 50% range increases on Pestilence is generally considered a godsend for AoEing, and to go without it would be rather silly.<br>

The final Death Coil of the rotation is placed in parentheses as you will not always have the RP to perform it every two rune refreshes.<br>
<br>
With Epidemic being taken once again, your rotation reverts back to the traditional Unholy one. Priority wise, it is the same as ever: Apply diseases (PS - IT), dump your RP if its capped (DC), burn your blood runes for Desolation and/or Death Runes (BS - BS), use your FU strike (SS), dump your RP (DC), use Horn if you have an extra gcd and are unable to do anything else (HoW). <br>
<br>
In situations where you have additional RP thanks to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100228222358/http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=48707" target="_blank">Anti-Magic Shell</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100228222358/http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=48545" target="_blank">Revitalize</a>, or <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100228222358/http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=47537" target="_blank">Rapture</a>, there are three places where you can afford the GCD: at the very end of the first set of runes, at the very end of the second set of runes and, if you still have excess runic power after using up those two spots, in place of the Horn of Winter. Unlike in patch 3.2.2, Death Coil is no longer our hardest hitting ability. It is not worth delaying the entirety of your rotation for it. Dump any extra runic power in the three spots specified and, if you are still over capping on RP after that, so be it. Let it rot.<br>

As its name suggests, you perform the initial segment of the rotation with your first set of runes, then alternate between the second and third order of abilities for the remainder of the fight (or until diseases fall off). Do not make the mistake of repeating the initial rotation after the third; it’s unnecessary with <a id="itemlink" class="q1" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100228222358/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=45805" target="_blank">[Glyph of Disease]</a>.<br>
<br>
Blood Striking to proc Desolation is a larger net dps gain than Blood Boiling, for those who are curious. If Desolation is already up, then Blood Boiling becomes the clear winner, of course.<br>
<br>
One common mistake players make is to Death and Decay before spreading their diseases. Doing so is a bad move (from a dps point of view. Tanking is another matter). Although it might seem like a dps gain to use Death and Decay initially so it is off cooldown sooner, it loses a lot of damage if your diseases aren’t on the target (15% from Rage of Rivendare, 13% from Ebon Plague, so on). As well, spreading your diseases sooner means more raid dps thanks to Ebon Plague.<br>

Basically:<br>
<b>T8/T9 Content:</b> Hit &gt; Strength &gt; Crit Rating &gt; ArP &gt;= Expertise &gt; Haste &gt; Agility<br>
<b>T10 Content:</b> Hit &gt; Strength &gt; ArP &gt; Crit &gt; Haste &gt; Expertise &gt; Agility<br>
<br>
ArP has always scaled amazingly well with itself, which is part of the reason why, up until now, Unholy has been in Blood's shadow (at least in terms of single target dps). Now that the majority of Unholy's damage is affected by it, thanks to Scourge Strike, this scaling applies to us as well, making it a much more attractive stat.<br>
<br>
Haste has decreased moderately in value due to the fact that our rotation is no longer GCD limited as it was in 3.2.2. The main reason haste used to be of such worth was due to it reducing the spell GCD, which in terms helped alleviate the GCD limitations of the spec, for large gains in dps. With Epidemic and Reaping we now have numerous empty GCDs, and thus all haste does is increasing our (and our pet’s) white damage, making it a decent, but unspectacular stat.<br>
<br>
Aside from that, the general order of the weights are relatively unchanged. And, as such, the following are the currently theorized stat weights for Unholy DKs:<br>
<br>
<i> T9 bonuses are included in the iLvl 245/258 weights (TotC) and T10 in the iLvl251/264/277 weights (ICC), to best simulate the realities of those tiers.

There's a common misconception that trinkets are somehow harder to evaluate than other items. They (generally) aren't. A trinket's value comes down to nothing more than:<br>
<br>
<table class="stg_table tborder"><tbody><tr class="alt2"><td><b>Trinket Value</b> = </td><td> (Amount of Passive Stat x Passive Stat's Weight) + ((Amount of Proc/Use Stat x Proc/Use Stat's Weight) x Proc/Use Uptime)</td></tr></tbody></table><!-- table generated by StG's vB Code [table] v.0.1.6.0 (stable) o.95 --><br>
Simple, no?<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, however, there is the reason I put generally in parenthesis earlier: Blizzard does not make internal cooldowns (and, thus, uptimes) visible from an item's tooltip or datamined information, which <i>can</i> make trinkets difficult to eyeball in value. As such, the following table includes the handful of top trinkets ranked by their relative value (at current gear points) with the uptime of the trinket's proc/use effect, as well as any other information of note:<br>
<br>
<i>Proc/Use uptimes are approximate; they will vary based on specific fight mechanics, RNG, and such.</i><br>

<i>*It's very important to emphasize that, when it comes to these charts, hit trinkets assume that <u>all</u> of the hit is used. As, odds are, some of the hit will be wasted and/or you will have to swap around gear/enchants in other areas to make room for the vast amount found on these trinkets, don't blindly adhere to this chart and do take that into account when considering their value. If you are seriously contemplating using one of those trinkets - which are rarely worthwhile unless you have no other moderately decent options - do the math on your own. <br>

Generally speaking, when it comes to gemming, you want to go for strength gems – <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100228222358/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=40111" target="_blank">[Bold Cardinal Ruby]</a> or <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100228222358/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=40142" target="_blank">[Inscribed Ametrine]</a> – in all slots. When to use which is discussed below in more detail.<br>
<br>
With the exception of meta-gem requirements, also discussed below, you never want to use blue or purple gems, as socket bonuses are not large enough to make them worth one’s while. <br>
<br>
<a name="Meta-Gem"></a><h3><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100228222358/http://elitistjerks.com/f72/t72364-unholy_dps_3_3_3_i_run_you/#top" class="nuwiki_top_link">[top]</a>Meta-Gem</h3><br>
There are two meta-gems of interest to an Unholy DK: <a id="itemlink" class="q3" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100228222358/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=41285" target="_blank">[Chaotic Skyflare Diamond]</a> and <a id="itemlink" class="q3" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100228222358/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=41398" target="_blank">[Relentless Earthsiege Diamond]</a>. Although crit rating is superior to agility on a one-for-one basis, the latter meta-gem has laxer requirements: one red, one yellow, and one blue gem as opposed to two blue gems. <br>
<br>
Regardless of which gem you use, you use a <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100228222358/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=49110" target="_blank">[Nightmare Tear]</a> to knock out (one of, in the case of the Chaotic Skyflare Diamond) the blue gem requirement(s). You may only use one Nightmare Tear in your gear, and it will count as a red, yellow, and blue gem, all at once.<br>
<br>
So how does one decide whether using a second blue gem to activate the Chaotic Skyflare Diamond is worth it over simply using the Relentless Earthsiege Diamond, which is activated solely by the Nightmare Tear?<br>
<br>
<table class="stg_table tborder sortable" id="sorttable2980"><thead class="thead"><tr><th><b>Stat</b> </th><th>  <b>iLvl 245/258</b> </th><th> <b>iLvl 251/258</b> </th><th> <b>iLvl 264</b> </th><th> <b>iLvl 277</b></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="alt2"><td>Attack Power </td><td> 18 </td><td> 18 </td><td> 18 </td><td> 17</td></tr><tr class="alt1"><td>Strength </td><td> 6 </td><td> 6 </td><td> 6 </td><td> 6</td></tr><tr class="alt2"><td>Crit Rating </td><td> 9 </td><td> 10 </td><td> 9 </td><td> 8 </td></tr><tr class="alt1"><td>ArP Rating </td><td> 9 </td><td> 8 </td><td> 7 </td><td> 6 </td></tr><tr class="alt2"><td>Expertise Rating </td><td> 11 </td><td> 11 </td><td> 10 </td><td> 9</td></tr><tr class="alt1"><td>Haste Rating </td><td> 11 </td><td> 10 </td><td> 9 </td><td> 8</td></tr><tr class="alt2"><td>Agility </td><td> 12 </td><td> 14 </td><td> 12 </td><td> 11</td></tr><tr class="alt1"><td>Hit Rating </td><td> 5 </td><td> 5 </td><td> 5 </td><td> 4</td></tr></tbody></table><!-- table generated by StG's vB Code [table] v.0.1.6.0 (stable) o.95 --><br>
As long as you can get a socket bonus of one of the preceding sizes from using one blue gem, zero yellow gems, and any number of red gems, then using a Chaotic Skyflare Diamond becomes superior to using a Relentless Earthsiege Diamond. Generally speaking, you actually need two socket bonuses of the above size(s), as the first you would attain using your Nightmare Tear, regardless of which meta-gem, and thus can’t be counted towards deciding between the two.<br>

There are, essentially, two cases in which you will want to divert from the “Gem everything for strength” mantra that otherwise holds true and go for yellow/orange.<br>
<br>
The first case is if you aren’t at the hit cap. Hit is your most valuable stat before such a point, and as such it is ideal to gem for it. In such a situation simply use <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100228222358/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=40125" target="_blank">[Rigid King's Amber]</a> in yellow sockets with <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100228222358/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=40143" target="_blank">[Etched Ametrine]</a> in red sockets until you reach the melee cap.<br>
<br>
The second case is a matter of the following chart. Whenever a socket bonus requiring any number of red sockets, zero blue sockets, and then one (or more, simply multiply the number in the chart appropriately) yellow sockets, has a bonus that is equal to or higher than the number listed in the following chart utilize an <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100228222358/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=40142" target="_blank">[Inscribed Ametrine]</a>.<br>

As an Unholy DK, you only have two cooldowns - <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100228222358/http://”http//www.wowhead.com/?spell=42650”" target="_blank">Army of the Dead</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100228222358/http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=49206" target="_blank">Summon Gargoyle</a>. Maximizing their use is essential to maximizing one’s dps.<br>
<br>
<a name="Army_of_the_Dead"></a><h3><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100228222358/http://elitistjerks.com/f72/t72364-unholy_dps_3_3_3_i_run_you/#top" class="nuwiki_top_link">[top]</a>Army of the Dead</h3><br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100228222358/http://”http//www.wowhead.com/?spell=42650”" target="_blank">Army of the Dead</a> went through some changes with this last patch. On the one hand, it now has a shorter cooldown – 6 minutes talented (10 untalented) as opposed to 10 minutes talented (20 unalented) – and the channeling time of the spell went from 6 seconds to 4 seconds. On the other hand, it now does less damage – 50% of its previous amount.<br>
<br>
Similar to a Blood or Frost DK’s Ghoul or your own Gargoyle, Army of the Dead will take a snapshot of your AP, haste, and hit at the time summoned. Changes in these stats after you have casted the spell will have no effect on the summoned minions, and other stats – crit, ArP, and the like – will have no effect period. On top of this, your Army of the Dead ghouls will receive the 90% AoE damage reduction from your Night of the Dead talent that your other pets receive.<br>
<br>
The most optimal time to use Army of the Dead will vary from boss to boss, but is typically right before the beginning of an encounter. Using it mid encounter can lead to lost dps time, as the spell is channeled, and can also open the possibility of the spell getting interrupted by a fight mechanic, hurting the value of the spell. That said, if you are unable to cast it before the fight begins (or if it comes back off cooldown mid-fight) it is still worth casting mid-fight – ideally during a phase transition or similar period of down-time, but even on a Patchwerk-esqe fight it would be worth it – simply not as large a gain as using it immediately before the pull. <br>
<br>
One note about Army of the Dead is that although the summoned ghouls will not taunt a boss, they will taunt most adds present on boss encounters. Keep this in mind as it can cause a wipe if used inappropriately… or prevent one if used intelligently.<br>
<br>
<a name="Summon_Gargoyle"></a><h3><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100228222358/http://elitistjerks.com/f72/t72364-unholy_dps_3_3_3_i_run_you/#top" class="nuwiki_top_link">[top]</a>Summon Gargoyle</h3><br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100228222358/http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=49206" target="_blank">Summon Gargoyle</a> isn't terribly complex in its use. Your Gargoyle scales with your attack power and haste based on the moment it was cast, and will retain those exact stats for its entire duration. Try to wait on using it until all of your procs coincide, however, don't let this make you miss an opportunity to cast it. Summoning your Gargoyle three times in a fight is better than only summoning it twice, regardless of procs. As such, figure out how many times you'll be able to use it based on the fight length. Try and use it at some point during Heroism's duration - it needs to be popped AFTER Heroism is cast, while the buff is active on you, to benefit (unlike a Moonkin's treants). This is also the time to pop your Potion of Speed.<br>
<br>
Also remember, your Gargoyle has horrid AI. It will not attack Yogg-saron’s brain if summoned within the brain room (but will attack the brain if you summon it before entering the brain room) and will (usually) only melee XT Deconstructor’s Heart. Get familiar with odd instances such as these; know when your Gargoyle will and will not attack, so you don't waste 60 RP.<br>
<br>
Your Gargoyle will follow the same commands you give your Ghoul (i.e, follow, stay, attack, etc), so you can move it out of AoEs such as Shock Blast – however you are best off simply waiting until immediately after such spells to go off to summon it. <br>

<li>The spell hit cap is 445 hit rating (17%). Assuming Virulence and Misery this number decreases to 289 hit rating (11%). With a Draenei, it goes to 262 hit rating (10%). The only dps skills that are affected by this are Death Coil, Icy Touch, Death and Decay, Pestilence and Blood Boil.</li>
<li>You need 26 expertise (6.50%) to be expertise soft capped which means your attacks will no longer be dodged.</li>

</u><i>With your Ghoul being one of your highest sources of damage, and the primary tool which sets an Unholy DK apart from other DKs, there are some basic numbers to know about it.</i><ul><li>Ghouls work like most permanent pets, receiving a portion of your stats and can be buffed by the raid.</li>
<li>In terms of Paladin blessings, your Ghoul will receive the same blessings that the rogues are given. If no rogue is present, your Ghoul will need blessings given individually.</li>
<li>Ghoul Strength (with talents + <a id="itemlink" class="q1" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100228222358/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=43549" target="_blank">[Glyph of the Ghoul]</a>) = 331+1.52*Master'sStrength.</li>
<li>Ghouls receive 100% of your haste rating.</li>
<li>Ghouls have AoE mitigation, 45% for each point in NotD. This is both physical and magical damage reduction.</li>
<li>Ghoul hit rating rounds down. So if you have 7.99% hit rating, the ghoul will have 7% hit rating.</li>
<li>Ghouls gain expertise based on your hit rating. So if you had 131 hit (4%), the pet gains 13 expertise. 263 hit (8%), the pet gains 26 expertise. The Draenei hit aura does not give expertise to the pet.</li>
<li> Ghouls benefit from the 15% haste of Unholy Presence, but not the 15% damage of Blood Presence.</li>

Multiple opportunities to soak: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100228222358/http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=69674" target="_blank">Mutated Infection</a> (a dot, similar to Grobbulus) and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100228222358/http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=69774" target="_blank">Sticky Ooze</a> (puddles left by the adds). The ooze adds - small and big - both deal magical damage to targets within a 10 yard radius, and thus can be abused for RP, although they shouldn't be by you for any extended period of time.<br>
<br>
Although <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100228222358/http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=69508" target="_blank">Slime Spray</a> can be soaked from, you shouldn't be in front of the boss.  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100228222358/http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=69789" target="_blank">Ooze Flood</a> is another ability which although soakable, one shouldn't risk it; you can die if you get caught up in it after AMS ends.<br>

If <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100228222358/http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=72615" target="_blank">Malleable Goo</a> is thrown at you, AMS away.<br>

There's <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100228222358/http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=70109" target="_blank">Permeating Chill</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100228222358/http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=69845" target="_blank">Frost Bomb</a> as well.<br>

P2: There's still <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100228222358/http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=73781" target="_blank">Infest</a>, but <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100228222358/http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=72762" target="_blank">Defile</a> is the main source of raid damage this phase.

<b><i>Northrend Beasts</i><br>
</b>P1: There are some explosions that you can soak some RP from easily enough, however they tend to only spawn on ranged, thus you have to decide whether or not it's worth it. That aside, you can get some during the knockback/silence, which is on a regular timer.<br>
P2: There are multiple opportunities to get free RP, and in this phase you should be using AMS the second it's on CD (provided you aren't already close to RP capped). You can soak from the poison on the ground, from the poison debuff, from the fire debuff, and from the knockback. If you see Acidmaw target you (and you didn't pull aggro), that means he is about to throw the poison debuff at you - you can use AMS to prevent its application entirely, saving you the loss in dps time which moving to someone with the fire debuff would require.<br>
P3: If a poison cloud is still up from P2, feel free to use it. That aside, the only other opportunity for AMS it to use it proactively to prevent the stun from his Frost Breath. If he targets you, not only will it prevent him from stunning you, it will prevent him from stunning everyone else, as he will cancel casting it. <br>
<br>
<b><i>Lord Jaraxxus</i><br>
</b>You can stand in the flames, pop it when an infernal is by you, or even try to time it when you think you'll get hit with a beam. Popping it while in flames or when an infernal is near are your best bets, and both are fairly common happenings.<br>
<br>
<b><i>Faction Champions</i><br>
</b>Here, you can almost pop it on CD. With the level of random damage the mobs throw around, simply wait until one is AoEing (Such as the warlock casting Hellfire) or until one (usually several) target you and start attacking.<br>
<br>
<b><i>Twin Valkyrs</i><br>
</b>There are two main opportunities here: You can either save AMS for the Dark/Light Vortex, which not only will give you a full RP bar, but it can also save you the trouble of switching essences. Your other option is to pop it and grab the wrong color essence. On heroic version, you can also cast it if you get Tough of Light/Darkness, granting you a full RP bar.<br>
<br>
<b><i>Anub'Arak</i><br>
</b>Pop it when you have a few stacks of the poison debuff from the scarabs which spawn during the burrowed phase. You can also pop it at any time during the Swarm (30% until death).<br>

<b><i>Flame Leviathan</i><br>
</b>N/A<br>
<br>
<b><i>Razorscale</i><br>
</b>P1: Run through a fire patch on your way over to Razorscale after she's been harpooned.<br>
P2: There is usually a flame patch in the near vicinity of the boss, simply hop in that every 45s.<br>
<br>
<b><i>Ignis</i><br>
</b>Simply time AMS for use right after he finishes his Flame Jets cast. Know that if you use AMS before the cast is finished you won't receive the debuff and will therefore generate far less RP than you could otherwise. Additionally, you want to start burning RP as soon as you start gaining it, or you will quickly become capped, and waste the extra RP from AMS.<br>
<br>
<b><i>XT Deconstructor</i><br>
</b>You can elect to follow a light-bombed melee as they run out of the group. Otherwise, save AMS for when you get bombed, be it with Gravity or Light.<br>
<br>
<b><i>Kologarn</i><br>
</b>Wait until Shockwave comes off of cool down then, pop AMS and pray that he uses the ability within 5s seconds (he usually does).<br>
<br>
<b><i>Assembly of Iron</i><br>
</b>Steelbreaker: The High Voltage aura makes this fight one of the best for consist RP generation through AMS. Simply use AMS every time it is off cooldown and enjoy the free damage.<br>
Molgriem: You'll have to wait for a Rune of Death on the melee group and use AMS as you leave. <br>
Brundir: Lightning Tendrils is the best source of reliable magic damage. You can also take advantage of Overload, though know that you will suffer a 2s knockdown. Since it typically takes a second or two to get back in, this is pretty much a wash.<br>
<br>
<b><i>Auriaya</i><br>
</b>Wait for a fear and then dance through a void zone on your way back to the melee clump.<br>
<br>
<b><i>Hodir</i><br>
</b>Save AMS for Frozen Blows. Real ballers can also get 2-3 stacks of Biting Cold at the same time, though your healers will complain, as will the rest of your raid for ruining their achievement! An alternative is to use AMS when he casts Flash Freeze, as it will allow you to stay on the boss without getting frozen.<br>
<br>
<b><i>Thorim</i><br>
</b>P1: Wait for a Stormhammer cast and hope that you're standing near the target.<br>
P2: Instead of moving out, just sit in and soak the Lightning Charges.<br>
<br>
<b><i>Freya</i><br>
</b>P1: Sunbeam, if you can move close enough to the target in a timely fashion. There's also Nature's Fury.<br>
P2: Not much, as the bombs will tend to blow you away from the boss and should thus be avoided.<br>
<br>
<b><i>Mimiron</i><br>
</b>P1: Find an isolated land mine and trigger it on your way back to the boss from a Shock Blast.<br>
P2: Use AMS immediately after you see Heat Wave pulse to make your healers happier.<br>
P3: Bomb bot explosions are the only source of magic damage.<br>
P4: Use AMS whenever it is off cooldown. Odds are, you will be targeted by Hand Pulse sometime during the duration.<br>
<br>
Due to having to weave in and out a lot on the Mimiron encounter, this is a great fight to try to maximize your RP through AMS, additionally there are lots of way to die, so avoiding death is always your greatest DPS gain!<br>
<br>
<b><i>Vezax</i><br>
</b>This is the only fight in Ulduar without reliable AoE magic damage. In the hard mode version of the encounter, however, you can pop it as the Animus is stacking its debuff for some RP, although it isn't much, and you only get one real opportunity to do so.<br>
<br>
<b><i>Yogg-Saron</i><br>
</b>P1: If your guild elects to tank all the guardians in the center, you can use AMS to soak their detonations.<br>
P2: There is lots of shadow damage if you're in the portal group (hint: you should be) from Grim Reprisal.<br>
P3: Nothing here, as you should not be getting hit with Lunatic Gaze.<br>
<br>
<b><i>Algalon</i></b><br>
AMS can be popped before Cosmic Smash or before a Collapsing Star dies. Either option will give you a full RP bar, and both happen more than every 45 seconds. If you try to soak from a Cosmic Smash, beware: AMS will not prevent you from going flying if you are too close. Soaking on a Collapsing Star is typically safer, and grants the same gain.<br>

<a name="Frequently_Asked_Questions"></a><h1><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100228222358/http://elitistjerks.com/f72/t72364-unholy_dps_3_3_3_i_run_you/#top" class="nuwiki_top_link">[top]</a>Frequently Asked Questions</h1><br>
</u><br>
<b>The most basic first; what presence should I be in and why?</b><br>
Blood Presence is always the superior option. In the previous patch Unholy Presence was moderately competitive at certain gear points due to the GCD reduction aspect and the fact that our rotation was GCD constrained. Considering the latter is no longer the case, thus making the former now of absolutely zero value, the comparison between the two presences simply comes down to the damage verse the haste. 15% damage is an increase of approximately 12.75% dps, when you consider that it affects all of our damage except ghoul, gargoyle, and army. 15% haste, on the other hand, is only an increase of maybe 7.5% dps, as it only affects auto-attack (and auto-attack related, such as Necrosis, BCB, and Bryntroll) damage and pets.<br>
<br>
Not just that, but Scourge Strike double dips into the 15% damage buff of Blood Presence, increasing its value and cementing it as the clear choice.<br>
<br>
<b>Double dips? I see that mentioned a lot in regards to Scourge Strike, but never an explanation of what it means.</b><br>
The short, simple answer: If a buff or talent affects the damage of Scourge Strike once, it single dips. If it affects the damage of Scourge Strike twice, thus boosting the damage by more than the stated amount, then it double dips and is of increased worth.<br>
<br>
The long answer: The new Scourge Strike is split into two actual hits; the first being physical damage and the second being shadow damage. The damage of the shadow portion is entirely dependent on the damage of the physical. What this means is that anything that increase the damage of the physical portion – be it a stat, a buff, a debuff, or a talent – will also increase the shadow portion by the same proportion. Outbreak, for example, increases the damage of the physical strike by 20% and by doing so, the shadow strike is increased by 20%, causing the Scourge Strike to do 20% more damage overall than it otherwise would, as the talent states.<br>
<br>
However, some buffs and talents will affect the physical strike (thus increasing the damage of the shadow strike) <i>but then also affect the shadow strike directly</i>. Blood Presence, as previously mentioned, is one such buff. It will increase the damage of the physical strike by 15% which will then increase the damage of the shadow strike by 15%. On top of that, however, it will then go and buff the damage of the shadow strike by 15% <i>yet again</i>, meaning while the physical portion had its damage increased by 15%, the shadow portion had its damage increased by 32.25%. Thus the amount Blood Presence increased your overall Scourge Strike damage will be greater than the stated 15%.<br>
Bone Shield, Desolation, Two-Handed Weapon Specialization, Blood Presence, Ferocious Inspiration, Sanctified Retribution, and Arcane Empowerment are all buffs or talents which are double dipped.<br>
<br>
<b>Cool and all, but does that explain why the shadow portion of Scourge Strike deals more than the stated 75% of the physical portion?</b><br>
Yes, it does. Double-dipping is the culprit. After you factor in all of the previously mentioned buffs and talents, you’ll find that the shadow portion will ultimately deal 107.3 % of the physical portion (less partial resists), hence making them near identical, and explaining the almost total lack of gap between the two parts you’ll notice in parses.<br>
<br>
<b>Speaking of Scourge Strike, mine outdamages two Blood Strikes and I don’t have 2P T10! Surely that means I should take Reaping, right?</b><br>
Yes, due to the changes of the last patch, one’s Scourge Strike is almost always going to outdamage two Blood Strikes, the reason for the almost being severely low gear points as the exceptions. However, no, that fact in and of itself does not make Reaping a worthwhile talent. <br>
<br>
Opportunity cost. You can’t simply look at what you gain by taking Reaping; you also what you lose by taking it, and that’s three points in Dark Conviction/Bladed Armor/Necrosis (depending on spec specifics). Thus for Reaping to be a solid investment, your Scourge Strike needs to outdamage two Blood Strikes by enough so as to be more damage than three points in any of those aforementioned talents. Such isn’t the case until you acquire 2P T10 and/or have a solid amount of ICC gear (specifically an ICC weapon and a moderate amount of ArP).<br>
<br>
<b>You briefly mentioned partial resists before. Can’t you just gem/enchant some spell penetration to eliminate them?</b><br>
No, you cannot. Bosses will always partially resist a certain fraction of your magical damage. Such is unavoidable, regardless of spell penetration. Simply live with it.<br>
<br>
<b>What about misses and dodges though? Hit and expertise will eliminate those two, right, so we obviously want to hit those caps, correct?</b><br>
Yes, the chance to miss and the chance to be dodged can be eliminated completely by hit and expertise respectively. However, although the hit cap is worth going out of your way to reach, the expertise cap is not. It simply doesn’t affect enough of our damage to be worthwhile, and due to the fact that our rotation now contains extra GCDs, losing one occasionally because we have to repeat an ability thanks to a dodge isn’t that big of a deal. <br>
<br>
<b>How do racials stack up?</b><br>
Orc is the superior Horde dps race, without question. 5 Expertise, 5% pet damage, and Blood Fury are simply amazing racials, and perfect for an Unholy DK.<br>
<br>
Assuming your raid doesn’t already have five of them, Draenei are the best for Alliance. Although Gift of the Naaru is essentially worthless, 1% hit for yourself and four others is quite nice. If your raid does already run with enough Draenei to cover everyone with the aura, then Humans come next, with 3 Expertise (which is of debatable worth, with all the best weapons being axes) and Every Man for Himself, an excellent racial whose worth is difficult to quantify into a specific amount of damage.<br>
<br>
<b>What about a Black Ice build? Is it competitive?</b><br>
No. Black Ice is an excellent talent... in a vaccum. Point for point, it's superior to Dark Conviction, Bladed Armor, and Necrosis. Unfortunately, due to how the Frost tree is arranged, you have to all but literally waste 5 talent points to get to it, which doubles the point:dps ratio, and simply kills the talent.<br>
<br>
If it were to ever be moved up a tier, or if you could pick up a real dps talent along the way, BI specs (in the form of 7/10/54) would become the way to go. Until then, forget it.<br>
<br>
<b>Last patch Unholy DW was pretty much neck and neck with Unholy 2H, yet I no longer see it listed as a viable build. What happened?</b><br>
Scourge Strike. As Unholy, it all comes down to SS these days, especially as gear progresses. SS simply does not scale with a one hander as well as a two hander, for obvious reasons.<br>
<br>
What more is the fact that Unholy Blight was nerfed, which hurts Unholy DW more (proportionally) than it hurts 2H.<br>
<br>
<b>Alright, so I have two pieces of tier 10, as well as a moderate amount of ICC gear in general. From what you say, I should be able to use Reaping and gain dps, but Kahorie’s Simulator doesn’t seem to agree?</b><br>
Either you are making an error in your use of the simulator, or your gear is simply insufficient (remember, there is a reason I use generalities and not specifics for Reaping). <br>
If it’s the former, the error likely lies in your rotation. You cannot use the default “Reaping” rotation to test a Reaping build. Illogical, yes, but true nonetheless. It will not give you optimal results for various reasons due to technicalities of the sim. What you must instead use is the following:<br>
<br>
<table class="stg_table tborder"><tbody><tr class="alt2"><td>&lt;Rotation&gt;</td></tr><tr class="alt1"><td>  &lt;Rotation&gt;</td></tr><tr class="alt2"><td>    &lt;PlagueStrike retry="1" /&gt;</td></tr><tr class="alt1"><td>    &lt;IcyTouch retry="1" /&gt;</td></tr><tr class="alt2"><td>    &lt;BloodStrike retry="1" /&gt;</td></tr><tr class="alt1"><td>    &lt;BloodStrike retry="1" /&gt;</td></tr><tr class="alt2"><td>    &lt;ScourgeStrike retry="1" /&gt;</td></tr><tr class="alt1"><td>    &lt;DeathCoil retry="0" /&gt;</td></tr><tr class="alt2"><td>    &lt;DeathCoil retry="0" /&gt;</td></tr><tr class="alt1"><td>    &lt;ScourgeStrike retry="1" /&gt;</td></tr><tr class="alt2"><td>    &lt;Horn retry="1" /&gt;</td></tr><tr class="alt1"><td>    &lt;ScourgeStrike retry="1" /&gt;</td></tr><tr class="alt2"><td>    &lt;ScourgeStrike retry="1" /&gt;</td></tr><tr class="alt1"><td>    &lt;DeathCoil retry="0" /&gt;</td></tr><tr class="alt2"><td>    &lt;DeathCoil retry="0" /&gt;</td></tr><tr class="alt1"><td>  &lt;/Rotation&gt;</td></tr><tr class="alt2"><td>&lt;/Rotation&gt;</td></tr></tbody></table><!-- table generated by StG's vB Code [table] v.0.1.6.0 (stable) o.95 --><br>
If that doesn’t show Reaping to be better for you yet, then your either making an error elsewhere (although, aside from spec, nothing should change when testing between Reaping and Non-Reaping, as any other issues would affect the results of both specs, not just one) or your gear is simply insufficient for the transition. <br>
<br>
<b>How does X work? What about Y? Can you explain Z?</b><br>
If there are any other questions which aren’t answered anywhere in this post already but you feel are asked enough and applicable to most people, and thus should be added to this section, simply drop me a PM concerning it. <br>

So on. Generally speaking, Unholy comes within 5-10% of Blood on single target (and, quite obviously, far surpasses Blood in AoE, so I didn't bother linking those sorts of parses). Although, as such, it is certainly still behind Blood in raw dps, it's by a much smaller margin than in 3.1. It's still a bit early to really tell, however, especially when you consider that Unholy will benefit the most from 4p t9 (which could potentially be enough to put it over the top).<br>
<br>
Oddly enough, Unholy outperforms Blood in Kahorie's sim, both pre and post 4p t9. It probably undervalues Hysteria, DRW, and cooldown stacking in general - one of Blood's strengths. It's certainly undervaluing (or overvaluing) <i>something</i>, as there's yet to be any parses reflecting the type of lead the simulator hints at.<br>
<br>
Anyways, when you factor in Unholy's added raid utility, the two are both very attractive raid specs. Neither is flat out superior to the other in overall raid contribution, even if one does beat out the other in raw single target dps. Which you spec should have more to do with which playstyle you enjoy the most, what sort of gear you already have, and what type of raid composition you typically run with than anything else.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Also! You should create a post within this thread to post parses on this spec! it'd give people a good idea of how much dps this unholy+oblit spec can do. We all know everyone only looks for the best possible dps output spec raid wise anyway.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Here's EJ's last ToC/Ulduar clear, I'm Unholy and Tejax is blood, who outdamages me on every fight except Freya.  Luckily Crypt Fever is worth something like 1000 dps split across 2 dps and 1 tank DK, so I don't feel so bad about it.  There is certainly room for improvement on my part, however.  One thing I am trying to figure out is how Sense (and a number of other DKs whose parses I looked up) had nearly double the amount of autoattacks and significantly more Obliterates than I do on XT despite the fight lengths being essentially the same.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1369468"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->You're reading WoL wrong (I hate WoL. More information, yes, but a much less user friendly interface). Where WMO says the total number of times you did an ability (79 Obliterates, in the case of my XT) and then lists the percent of those which were crits, WoL splits it into two numbers - the number of hits (47 Obliterates in yours) and crits (39 Obs in yours). Thus you actually did 86 Obliterates to my 79, which isn't significantly different when you factor in the slightly different kill times.<br>
<br>
Same situation with auto-attacks, except WoL actually splits it into three numbers - Hits, Crits, and Glancing Blows.<br>
<br>
Anyways, I don't really see the need to add a specific section/post for parses. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100228222358/http://www.wowmeteronline.com/rank/clazz/dps/dkt/7/0/3/320" target="_blank">WoW Meter Online - Combatlog Replay</a> / <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100228222358/http://www.wowmeteronline.com/rank/clazz/dps/dkt/8/0/3/320" target="_blank">WoW Meter Online - Combatlog Replay</a> give you a good enough idea of where the specs stand in relation to one another on each encounter. That, and you can also filter those by spec. Of course, not everyone uses WMO, not everyone gets Hysteria/Tricks/Etc, and on certain fights there are ways to pad the meters (hello, Ignis), but regardless, it's as good a compilation of top parses as a post here could be.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The thread title is Unholy DPS. DW Unholy has two strong variations that should definitely be made mention of in my humble opinion, unless you are specifically making mention of the opinion involved in this OP and limiting the information to 2 Handed usage only.<br>
<br>
DW Unholy has more in common with 2H Unholy actually. Every DW Unholy build is deep Unholy(50+ points) and none of them Take the Deep Frost Talent ToT, unless you consider the first tiers up to and including Annihilation to be more in common with Frost I would have to disagree with your opinion. I can understand you wanting to create a thread for 2Handed builds specifically, but it is probably a disservice to the community to post things that are fairly far from the truth given the evidence and sim data available. DW Unholy is nearly identical to 2 Handed Unholy in pretty much every way(Rotation, Glyphs and gearing), and DW Unholy Obliterate builds are essentially the pioneer of the spec most 2 Hand Unholy players are using right now. <br>
<br>
If you are going to create a thread, it may be a good idea to post every viable high end build without prejudice or personal opinion interjected and let the audience sort out the choices for themselves. Players could find the information beneficial, as they would be able to pick up one handers for both Unholy and Frost DW builds. If they read this thread it would appear that Unholy is exclusive to 2 Hander use only. it is not.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
But, please, lay off the melodrama. There is no hidden bias, intentional or otherwise. The old thread was focused on 2h Unholy, and this is merely a replacement (as the old one is no longer being updated) - thus this one is focused on 2h Unholy as well. There is a DW thread, with an Unholy DW section already - whether you consider it proper to be located in that thread is rather irrelevant. It's already there, so why have another thread with the exact same info, and inevitably the exact same discussion?<br>
<br>
I was thinking of the DC spam build when I spoke of different rotation/glyphs/gearing , but the opposite stance works just as well: If 0/18/53 has the exact same rotation, glyphs, and gearing, what is there to say about it? <br>
<br>
The bottom line though is this: If the DW thread did not cover Unholy DW, you might have a point or two. But it does. So you don't. There is zero need for two threads covering the same topic.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

The problem is that a lot of these builds(DW Unholy) are rarely played, and have not gotten much attention because of the general lack of interest in them until the recent re-modeling of the Frost tree to compliment 1 Hander use by DK's. That part is not going away, so i thought why not give the player base all the information they require in order to find the best possible build for their existing gear sets. I have only seen one active poster simming out extended data for DW Unholy Obliterate, and I am not sure he has been using the most recent gearing, pretty sure it has been the Ulduar set up. DW Unholy-Oblit breaks 7k DPS sims with average lag. This is the same, or nearly the same(within 100-150 dps) as all of the sim data I have viewed from the previous 2 Handed Unholy thread that is still active.<br>
<br>
Unholy has a very complimentary talent tree for DW, and key Talents(Necrosis and BcB) perform much better than 2 Handed builds when run with DW as they are considered pillars of those builds(hence them being included in a lot of/all ToT Frost Builds), they go from being "filler" with 2 Handed specs, to being strong performers with DW. Otherwise the fundamentals stay the same.<br>

<br>
<br>
Not sure why there needs to be singling out, I for one love the Unholy tree and have played it(Both Single rune builds and Oblit builds) since the changes to 0/32/39 in 3.1, and I love playing it still. It kind of confuses me when it is considered some sort of sub-par spec. <br>
<br>
Would be sweet to see it included in any official Unholy thread, as whenever possible, weapon choice determining validity with no data saying otherwise feels odd. These specs all perform on the same level, they are all bringing the same buffs, and with the exception of weapon choice, are geared in the same way, with the exception of DW 0/17/54 single rune spam builds.<br>

I have also been searching for the same thing Kuzuryu, but I cannot find any comparable parses. Every single one I find is full of abuse to constructs.<br>
<br>
Hopefully this thread can be a brewing on some of the more recent parses. I am sure a few of the regular Unholy 2 Handed build players will have something you can compare with.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">You're reading WoL wrong (I hate WoL. More information, yes, but a much less user friendly interface). Where WMO says the total number of times you did an ability (79 Obliterates, in the case of my XT) and then lists the percent of those which were crits, WoL splits it into two numbers - the number of hits (47 Obliterates in yours) and crits (39 Obs in yours). Thus you actually did 86 Obliterates to my 79, which isn't significantly different when you factor in the slightly different kill times.<br>
<br>
Same situation with auto-attacks, except WoL actually splits it into three numbers - Hits, Crits, and Glancing Blows.</div>

I really like Unholy's place in 3.2 (earlier today I got a chance to be Unholy in a 25 man, usually I tank).   Since Unholy is doing so well with Obliterate with dps, perhaps that is partly why SS was nerfed (also PvP reasons).  I really like the buffed pet (gains 26 expertise if you have 263 hit, so Alliance DK have some advantage going over their lower hit cap) and the buffs affects AotD as well.  <br>

</div>Less dps than a plain 3/13/55 spec*, which has the same benefit of threat reduction. Wandering Plague is ~1.2-1.4% per point on a single target encounter (and vastly higher on a multiple mob one). You should never, ever sacrifice points from it. It's simply an amazing investment. The loss of a point in that on top of the loss of 3 points in Desolation/Necrosis just isn't balanced out by the gain of Chill of the Grave.<br>
<br>
*Edit: At least for me. If you are still using SotVH, then it might be better than 3/13/55, but I kinda doubt it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yeah, I put them up there. The reason I didn't bother adding them originally, despite already having them calculated, is due to most people having trouble undertanding exactly what they mean. That, and almost all 2h weapons have the same speed. But, regardless, it's now there.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Im curious though, does the amount of ARpen you have ever push 3/13/55 above 0/17/54 with the new sigil? or will it simply always be inferior until you have 4 piece tier9?<br>

		<div id="post_message_1369716"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->It's not that 4 piece tier 9 pushes 3/13/55 above 0/17/54. It's that the lack of 2 piece tier 8 - which you won't actually lose until 4 piece tier 9 - does the trick. Just a slight clarification.<br>
<br>
But, yes, there is a point with ArP where 3/13/55 will do more dps, even with 2 piece tier 8. What that exact point is, however, has yet to be determined. You're welcome to use Kahorie's (linked in the OP) to calculate it yourself.<br>
<br>
I have about ~280 ArP, and 3/13/55 does about 25 dps less in the last time I ran the sim, for what that shows.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

One quick question about the rotation though, is there a reason you have OB before BS?  I just figured it was just assuming you had desolation up.  But on the initial cast, wouldn't you want to make sure it's up before you OB?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1369733"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->It's 200 strength (via Sigil of Virulence) to your first two Blood Strikes and an auto-attack or two <b>or</b> 3-5% damage (depending on how many points you have in Desolation) to your first Obliterate and an auto-attack.<br>
<br>
I can't honestly say which is superior. The difference is probably quite minor, if there is a noticeable one at all (Over the course of an entire fight, it's <i>maybe</i> a single digit dps difference. Maybe. Remember, whichever order you choose, it will only make a difference that very first rotation. Thus even if doing one order over the other is a 2,000 damage gap - extremely doubtful - over the course of a 6 minute fight? That's 6 dps). <br>
<br>
What I can say is that the simulator does Obliterate first (due to how the priority works) and that SoV will have a slightly higher uptime if you do Obliterate first (due to how the ICD interacts with when your other Obliterates happen after that first one). Thus the reason I list the rotation as it is. Doing your Blood Strikes first, however, isn't wrong, and I would be surprised if you noticed any difference.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
In terms of DPS pots to pop, wouldn't the Insane strength potions outweigh the speed potions during a heroism?  If I am not mistaken, haste from gear [which is dk by dk prolly 5% to 10% on avg] and the heroism already push the Gargs cast time down to 1 second and you cannot push it below that due to global cool down restrictions.  Just wanted another set of eyes on this in case I am missing something.<br>
<br>
Second question [and a great deal less important given the circumstance] would be, if lets say I just proc a comets trail and do not have access to heroism.  Does that get me close enough to the 1 second cast to merit using an insane str potion over a speed potion?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1369832"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I was curious which spec would win between the two if each of them had BiS gear, DW Frost or Unholy Obliterate.<br>
<br>
I took the gear posted in the Optimal BiS Gear thread, added up all the stats, enchants, gems, and my base character stats. Then I created a character in Kahorie's DK Simulator with that information.<br>
<br>
Some things to note:<br>
Talent templates used are the default 17-54 Unholy Oblit and 3-51-17 Frost in Kahorie's DK Simulator<br>
Priorities used are the default Unholy Oblit and Frost priorities in Kahorie's DK Simulator<br>
Both tests are in Blood Presence<br>
DW Test is Fallen Crusader / Razor Ice with Sigil of Awareness<br>
Unholy Test is Fallen Crusader with Sigil of Virulence<br>
I am an orc.<br>
I am a Blacksmith and Jewelcrafter, so I took the Bracer, Belt, and Gauntlet extra gem slots and plugged in +34 Str gems into it.<br>
I used a Nightmare's Tear on items with 1blue/1red with a +6str socket bonus to activate my meta.<br>
I used a 10str / 10crit gem on items with 1yellow/1red with a socket bonus of at least +6str.<br>
Characters have 2piece and 4piece T9 Activated<br>
Characters have Death's Choice and DMC: Greatness Activated<br>
These are 100 Hour tests.<br>
<br>
<b>Edit:</b> There are now screenshots of tallied up stat sets under the Optimal BiS Gear thread. These character sheets and results now reflect those screenshots added with the base stats of my orc.<br>

</div>As you can see based on the BiS gear posted in the Optimal BiS gear for each spec Unholy Obliterate wins 8945DPS to 8678DPS. I was under the impression the DW Frost was supposed to win in the end, but the sim shows other wise.<br>
<br>
If anyone else has tried this, gotten different results, or find that my math on character stats are wrong please feel free to let me know.<br>

One question though, why 4/5 Necrosis when it has been documented as a fairly low increase in dps compared to other talents.  My suggestion would be that since auto-attack is such a big proportion of the dps in this spec then would it not make sense to drop the 2 points that you can spare out of necrosis into Icy Talons?<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">The 1 second rune refresh reduction in IUP doesn't provide as much dps as one would expect it to in PvE due to the grace period of runes. <br>
<br>
Hard to explain, but hope this helps: When a rune refreshes itself, you essentially have a two second window where as long as you use it in those two seconds, it will come back up ten seconds from when it originally refreshed - not ten seconds after when you actually used it. Think of it as below:<br>
<br>
For purposes of this example, let's say all of your runes except one Blood rune are ignored.<br>
0 seconds - Blood Strike, Blood rune goes on CD<br>
10 seconds - Blood rune comes off CD<br>
11 seconds - Blood Strike, Blood rune goes on CD<br>
20 seconds - Blood rune comes off CD<br>
<br>
You see, in that example (which is exactly how it works), the rune actually refreshes in nine seconds after the first use. Thus a rune will refresh in 8 to 10 seconds, depending on how long after it comes off CD you use it. What IUP does is make a rune refresh in 8 to 9 seconds, depending on how long after it comes off CD you use it. So in the scenario above, <b>it would refresh one second quicker initially, but that's all</b>. So it does give some benefit, but it's not actually as much as you think - it's certainly not 11% more rune based damage/11% runic power generated. If it was, that on top of the haste would make it actually be worth using as Unholy.<br>
<br>
Or such is my understanding of it.<br>
<br>
For IUP (and haste in Cataclysm) to be truly effective, that grace period needs to scale as well. The grace period is essential (otherwise you're punished if you are mid GCD when a rune comes up, or if have even the slightest bit of lag, and so on), and the fact that it actually gets smaller with IUP is kinda nonsensical.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Your description of the IUP mechanics is accurate, but your interpretation (bolded above) is not. IUP will reduce your rune cooldown by 1 sec on every rune cooldown, not just the initial. In the above example, your Blood rune will come back 18 sec after its initial usage with IUP. The catch is that the reduced 1-sec grace period means that if your rotation uses runes asymmetrically between rune sets (most commonly BS+BS/OB and PS+IT/OB for Unholy), you have no leeway for latency/reaction delay (so if you have a 0.5-sec latency/reaction delay, your rune will effectively cool down in 9.5 sec instead of 9).<br>
<br>
Rotations with symmetrical rune usage between rune sets, on the other hand, will have a 1-sec grace period for latency/reaction delay to get the full benefit (9-sec runes) out of IUP. Currently there is only one known competitive spec/rotation (Unholy DW DC spam) that has symmetrical rune usage to take full advantage of IUP; unfortunately, it is the one spec/rotation Blizzard intends to kill off (Ghostcrawler quote from his recent one-line post: "Die Shadowfrost die!").<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

As you can see, the stat weights for the DW Unholy are different from the 2-Hand Unholy versions.  Haste is very strong.  A version that has more ArP will have a higher Armor Penetration weight.<br>
<br>
Using the 2H stats listed for BiS on this thread, using 200ms latency, this was my sim result:<br>
<br>
DPS 9144 <br>
Total Damage 3291.92m in 100h <br>
Threat Per Second 5991 <br>
Generated in 913s <br>

Sigil: Virulence  <br>
RuneEnchant: FallenCrusader / FallenCrusader <br>

<br>
Edit: I realize that the DW weapons would have different stats than the 2H that was used.  I just copied the stats and used Frost's weapons instead.  A better comparison would alter the stats based on the change of weapons.  My apologies for that bit of inaccuracy.  I also forgot to remove the Draenei bonus from the buffs section.<br>

@Grigori | Yeah, I knew there was something wrong in that post about ten seconds after I posted it. I just wasn't quite sure what. Thanks for pointing out my obvious (in hindsight &gt;&lt;) error. Regardless, that is the reason why I did not include it here. The primary problem with Shadowfrost and such variants isn't so much IUP as it is Glyph of Icy Touch (in combination with Chill of the Grave). It's that mass RP which continues to cause issues. 25 RP from 1 rune is flawed in many ways.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1371506"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->@Orlgin: Exactly what build are you using? Seing the post above me I'm curious if you didn't use WP. Octopi stated earlier in the DW thread that he finds WP to be a low dps per point value (~2% 3/3) which surprises me. Using IUP is probably still as always a preference and I would never go without it if I could possibly get it - but is WP really the place to take the points from?<br>
<br>
Also impressed by the output from a non-ToT DW build; would love to see a percentage of total damage from each skill (do Kahorie's list this?) to show how much is Obli and how much is DC (again Octopi stated he has around 14% Obli-damage and 24% DC).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1371629"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->There were two sections to that post.  The first (stat weights) used the stats listed.  The second has sim DPS value that was created using the BiS stats which are listed earlier in the thread.<br>
<br>
I used the same setup as the one earlier in the thread for BiS.  That includes both 2pc and 4pc T9.  I used the setup NaeblisHyjal suggested in his post.  I just forgot to do two things: 1) Change the stats a little since the 1H weapons would have different stats than the 2H and 2) Remove the Draenei bonus as he was an Orc.  The purpose was to compare Unholy, Frost, and DW Unholy using the same statset which was best in slot.  When I have more time, I'll edit the stats to reflect the new weapons, remove the Draenei bonus and post the result.<br>
<br>
Edit: What a difference bad 1H itemization makes:<br>
<br>
DPS 8829 <br>
Total Damage 3178.5m in 100h <br>
Threat Per Second 5781 <br>
Generated in 882s <br>
Template: OB001853 <br>
Priority: Unholy Oblit <br>
Presence: Blood  <br>
Sigil: Virulence  <br>
RuneEnchant: FallenCrusader / FallenCrusader <br>
Pet Calculation: True <br>
<br>
This suggests that DW and 2H are roughly the same DPS in Best In Slot Gear.  Good to know.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1371889"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Consider, what source or post are you quoting your stat weights from?  <br>
<br>
You suggest they are the currently accepted stat weights, but Zerack's Optimizer contains some values which are quite different.  Has he and the hive-mind behind EP values agreed upon these weights recently, and simply not updated his app?  If this is the case, Norg's BiS list will also currently be incorrect, and linking to it in this thread would be counter-productive, as they use a different weight scale than that which you provided.<br>

		<div id="post_message_1371911"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I simply used the default 2H set in Kahorie's, set it to 1000 hours, and then ran the EP calculations. <br>
<br>
I noticed after the fact that they differed slightly from Zerack's, however not significantly so. The ArP values he uses are slightly lower (and that's simply due to the nature of ArP - it depends heavily on how much you already have, and I think Kahorie's default 2H set has 300), and his haste values for 0/17/54 are kinda absurdly high (not quite sure why that's the case), but otherwise, they're all within 10% of one another, and it doesn't change the order of the stats. Make sure you're looking at Zerack's latest version, as his older versions have outdated/incorrect stat weights.<br>
<br>
In the end, however, your best bet is to always calculate stats based on your own gear. Although ArP is the most prominent example, all stats fluctuate in value depending on how much of that stat and of others you already have. <br>
<br>
I am very confident in saying that whatever weights you personally get, they will resemble these very closely - and these themselves resemble Zerack's (haste aside. Still boggles me why his is so high for 0/17/54. Main reason I didn't use his values, not that I don't trust them - the rest seem fine - but that seems kinda off) almost exactly.<br>
<br>
Edit: Also, although I appreciate it, there's really no reason to post "Good guide" and nothing else or those sorts of things. You'll probably just end up getting an infraction. Critcism/discussion/numbers/etc are the sorts of things you should be posting ^^<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I ran the sim for this scenario a while back in the old unholy thread. That was with an older sim that didn't roll diseases with the highest AP diseases, only the initial ones. The newest version 1.0.7.0 does however. I reran the sim with the following: 100h, 2h ulduar gear template, blood presence, sigil of virulence (the str helps in favor of a GoD spec), FC rune and unholy oblit priority. 0/17/54 was ran with 5/5 necrosis 3/5 desolation 0/2 IUP 0/1 Frenzy. 3/13/55 was exactly the same with the 1 additional pt in unholy spent in desolation. Lastly, the reason I subbed out GotG was because in my previous post in the old thread, subbing GoD for GotG was always more dps than subbing GoDD out.<br>
<br>
0/17/54 GoDD,GotG,GoOB<br>
7104<br>
<br>
0/17/54 GoD,GoDD, GoOB<br>
7169<br>
<br>
3/13/55 GoDD, GotG, GoOB<br>
7101<br>
<br>
3/13/55 GoD, GoDD, GoOB<br>
7191<br>
<br>
<br>
With the new sim, rolling diseases with the highest AP yields higher DPS when using GoD. One final note, the standard 2h ulduar gear template does not have any trinkets selected. Using trinkets with Str/AP procs would help in favor of a GoD build.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1372170"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I was more concerned with the Hit (To Spell Cap) value.  Under 3-13-55, your value is 0.57 whereas Zerack gives 1.67 for the same spec.  This trend is actually common for all the builds you list.  Depending on whether I use your or his EP values essentially decides if a build should be capped at hit level or capped at spell level, a difference of three or four pieces of gear with quick simulations.  I can't wrap my head around how important it is to make sure you never miss an IT or DC, so I don't know which value to put more faith into.  I've tried to use Kahorie's Sim to generate EP values for myself, but I have a fairly limited understanding of how it is calculated, and don't particularly trust my own results.<br>
<br>
In the mean time, it still stands that Norg is using Zerack's values, and therefore the BiS gear that he lists do not follow your stat weights.  One of them will eventually need to be corrected.<br>
<br>
<b>Edit:</b> I just took a look at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100228222409/http://code.google.com/p/dksimulator/updates/list" target="_blank">Kahorie's Google Code</a> page and read <i><font color="Blue">* EP Mode: Spell hit rating was evaluated too low. With default 50 hit rating, it would over cap. Problem corrected. For 2H spec, the Spell hit value is doubled.</font></i> under his very latest release (within 28 hours).  I don't know if this was the source of some miscalculations or the coming of some new ones, but I'm guessing EP values may need to be reworked again.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1372455"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->So has anyone switched to ob UH from blood that could share their results? Currently blood atm, but was wondering if switching to UH would result in a dps loss?

So I'm curious if the dps gain from EP to the raid would be enough to offset any personal dps I may or may not lose.

</div>You would likely go do a few hundred personal dps, maybe more if you aren't used to the spec.  However, you would gain raid dps, since CoD is very good dps for Locks and trash pulls would go faster.

		<div id="post_message_1372529"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->That spell hit error makes sense. Afterall, once you're melee hit capped, it only takes 1% to cap spells, so I can easily see the EP calculator going over. It's certainly something I'll look into and fix asap.<br>
<br>
As to the rest of it though, I'm still not completely confident in Zerack's numbers to use them (no offense to him, of course).  There's the huge haste outlier for 0/17/54, which seems rather odd. There's the fact that in his calculator 0/17/54 and 3/13/55 both have the exact same value for ArP, which obviously cannot be right since 3/13/55 has a larger portion of its damage as physical - and thus a larger amount will be affected by ArP, making it more valuable than it is for 0/17/54. Similar situation for agility. Opposite situation for spell hit - where it should be higher rated in 0/17/54, but it's equal. So on.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying my numbers are perfect or that his are horrible. Obviously neither is the case. What I am saying is that, logically speaking, there are a lot of questions about his numbers, and I would rather not put something in the OP which seems so improbable to be right. My numbers, which may not be perfect, at least make sense in relation to one another, and I know how I came to generate them, thus I have a bit more confidence in them.<br>
<br>
Anyways, all of that said, I will do my best to work on some more accurate numbers (or if they are already accurate, then some additional calculations to support them). When I have some time, I'll also generate "CC" stat weights (the current ones are based on end of Ulduar gear, which is what most people are probably at. I doubt most people have more than 1-3 pieces of CC gear at this point of time. With all of CC being out this week, however, I know there are some people who will be rapidly gearing up, so they're need numbers better suited to their gear level).<br>
<br>
If anyone has stat weights which seem logical and accurate, by all means, feel free to share them. But for now, Zerack's just don't seem to fit, so I have to rely on my own.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Just _thinking_ about it, no supporting numbers, I think the fact that you have no UH in your raid atm means that the Crypt Fever-gain might actually be enough to cover the dps-drop from switching to blood from unholy. Since it's a buff blood usually has from a fellow unholy DK otherwise etc.<br>

<br>
When I leave for classes/work later today, I plan to run some new EP calculations anyways.<br>
<br>
Also, to the above poster looking for trinket information, the proc values are listed over at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100228222414/http://elitistjerks.com/f72/t50274-kahories_dk_simulator_beta_1_0_a/p14/#post1353398" target="_blank">http://elitistjerks.com/f72/t50274-k...4/#post1353398</a> . Those are simply the proc values - so you need to multiply out the passive EP value to add to that number to see which trinket wins out.<br>
<br>
Edit: Actually, come to look at it, I'm not sure if those numbers are outdated or not. Greatness averages out to 100 str as its proc, as most people know, so you would think it's EP value to be in the 300s, while it's in the 200s. Could be an isolated thing. Regardless, Runestone is definitely better than Bandit's in terms of its proc - the first scales with gear while the latter doesn't. Bandit's, however, has the superior passive stats.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Lastly, the reason I subbed out GotG was because in my previous post in the old thread, subbing GoD for GotG was always more dps than subbing GoDD out.<br>

3/13/55 GoD, GoDD, GoOB 7191<br>
<br>
With the new sim, rolling diseases with the highest AP yields higher DPS when using GoD. One final note, the standard 2h ulduar gear template does not have any trinkets selected. Using trinkets with Str/AP procs would help in favor of a GoD build.</div>

Since I have been having some success with glyph of disease in both dual wield frost and blood, it makes me wonder how well the diseases would scale when all the procs that take place.<br>
<br>
Namely:<br>
2x tier 9 yields 180 strength<br>
death's verdict 450 strength<br>
greatness card 300 strength<br>
sigil of virulence 200 strength<br>
fallen crusader by 15%<br>
<br>
Do you know if the simulator calculates the best case scenario with glyph of disease, i.e. it keeps rolling on diseases when all of the +strength procs take place, for the duration of the fight? If not, I wonder if glyph of disease spec for Unholy 3/13/55 would be viable, since the sims you have previously calculated produce already very close results.<br>
<br>
Also, if we take into the account that ghoul is close to 10% of our DPS most fights, whereas death coil is roughly 8-9%, would it be more benefitial to sub out dark death for disease instead? (disease + obliterate + ghoul for 3/13/55, 2x t8, 2x t9, greatness, death's verdict, virulence) In addition, invest one point in ghoul frenzy instead of desolation or necrosis.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1373722"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Current stat weights and 4pc T9 EP values may not be looking at the interaction between 4pc (disease crit) and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100228222414/http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=49655" target="_blank">Wandering Plague</a>. I'm trying to figure out how this could impact the stat weights for Unholy. I don't have 4pc yet myself to test, so I will be very curious to see if disease crit "double dips" between these two abilities. <br>
<br>
This really needs in game testing to confirm. If this is indeed handled by a two roll system then each disease tick would have a chance to crit, and also a chance equal to your crit rating to trigger Wandering Plague. I believe we know currently that Wandering Plague copies the value of a given triggering tick and applies it to all valid targets. If a given triggering tick was already crit via 4pc, the full crit value could be reapplied giving you essentially a double-crit on all valid targets.<br>
<br>
It will be interesting to see if this changes the current 1.46 EP value for crit with 3/13/55.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1374107"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Finally home, and new EP values are as follows. Seems to be a bit more accurate (specifically in terms of the set bonuses - boni?), but nothing drastically changed (not that anything was expected to). Spell hit is still low, but it is the latest version of the sim, so not sure what to say. It only takes 1% spell hit after capping melee to cap spells (thanks to Virulence and Imp FF/Misery, along with 8% melee hit equalling 10% spell hit), so it shouldn't affect gearing practices.<br>
<br>
Unless someone sees something glaringly wrong, I will be updating the OP with these values although, as I said, they differences are very, very minor - these were just calculated over twice the period of time and with a slightly more accurate gear set (based on what would have been best in slot for 3/13/55 in 3.1, essentially). <br>

		<div id="post_message_1374110"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Well, I went ahead and did some simulations of my own. I edited the trinkets to match, that is Death's Verdict + Greatness. <br>
<br>
Here are my findings:<br>
1. The simmed DPS difference between (2x T8 + 2x T9) and (4x T8) is very small for 3/13/55.<br>
<br>
2. I was incorrect about death coil being only 8 to 9%. Must have been used to seeing Blood's. Using Dark Death, the breakdown is 12%, without Dark Death, it is around 10%.<br>
<br>
3. After taking away 1 point from Necrosis, and placed that into Ghoul Frenzy, it is always a DPS loss of +/-100 no matter what the glyphs are. Is this because the simulator attempts to keep Ghoul Frenzy with 100% up time? We would only use it if the ghoul needed healing, so I wonder if the DPS loss would be closer for that 1 point. (Looking at the Necrosis damage breakdown it is 0.7% for that 1 point as expected)<br>
<br>
4. Now the interesting part. Using glyphs of Obliterate + Disease + Ghoul versus Obliterate + Disease + Dark Death, the simmed result was only 30 DPS apart with Dark Death being higher, and both are 300 more DPS than Obliterate + Ghoul + Dark Death (traditional setup). So in conclusion all those strength buffs are very beneficial to either playstyle with the Disease glyph, and it probably comes down to preference. <br>
<br>
Ghoul usually has a lot of up time on DPS but it requires micro management on Mimiron, and as far as I know still bug fairly often at Yogg-Saron. Dark Death with proper usage of Anti-Magic Shell soaking can also be helpful.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Well, yeah, that's been known ^^. The EP differences between the two have typically run between 0 and 30, depending on other gear, which is quite insignificant. The extra stats 2p t9 gives you will push it ahead.<br>

</div>It shouldn't bother with Ghoul Frenzy unless you specify it in the rotation/priority file. Otherwise, it should essentially ignore it. Assuming you're doing ~7000 dps, 1 less point in Necrosis should be approximately ~50 dps. Without seeing the specific numbers with/without GF, can't see where the sim was going wrong, but the gap shouldn't be quite that big. <br>

</div>There's a couple issues I have with GoD and the simulator - and that's primarily the fact that fights do not last a million hours. GoD gets it's strength the longer the fight lasts, which is part of the reason why it's going to sim so high. If it takes you 30 seconds to get the optimal buffs stacked to begin rolling the best diseases for the remaining 5 minutes and 30 seconds of the fight, the glyph's value is going to be drastically different than if it takes you 30 seconds to get the optimal buffs stacked to begin rolling the best diseases for the remaining 1000 hours of the fight.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying GoD is bad, certainly not. I am saying that the simulator - through no fault of it's own, but simply by virtue of how it does (and how it has to do) simulations - overrates it. It just has no choice. Remember, simulators aren't perfect, after all. If anyone can present some good old fashioned math or a parse supporting it's use, by all means, I will happily throw it up on the OP (and probably try it out myself!) but, until then, as much as I do love Kahorie's, this is one glyph it can't accurately measure, so I can't and won't use it's word on it.<br>
<br>
But, yes, DD and Ghoul are very close in value. If you are still using SotVH and are 0/17/54, DD is almost certainly better. Aside from that situation, however, the stam increase in Ghoul (and the fact that Glyph of Ghoul scales with gear better) puts it ahead. That extra stam is the difference between my pet staying in on a Shock Blast on Mimiron Hard or me having to pull it out (or it just flat out dying). A dead Ghoul is something the sim can't account for, but is obviously a huge dps loss. Taking that risk for... 30 dps? Eh.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Your point about GoD being better over a thousand hours than over six minutes is of course correct. But you're wrong that that's how the simulator has to do it. You could just as easily tell the simulator to simulate ten thousand 5 minute fights or even tell it to simulate a thousand hours of fights broken into fights lasting an average of seven minutes and fitting a normal distribution. In fact, we could do this ourselves by setting up for smaller fights, running the simulator a great many times, and then averaging the results afterwards, but it would be a lot of work.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1374271"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->So, I've been trying to monitor all the spec talk since 3.2, but honestly can't keep up with the posters and all their posts on a consistent basis. Through all the reading I've done, it seems user Consider has the strongest arguments for game mechanics...<br>
In any case, I've heard some arguments in regards to DPS Blood vs. Unholy. I'm currently specced Unholy (0/17/54) and steadily improving gear from T7 to Ulduar, Conquest and Triumph gear. Is Unholy (in that gear slot) showing better overall in DPS? All posts seem to lead that way, but like I said, I may well miss things in the endless pages of reading EJ forums... (I know it's all been covered in one form or another, but I'm just looking for a bottom line if there is a 'better' tree, or if they're comparable and just a matter of play style.).<br>

		<div id="post_message_1374284"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Oh, that is true, Intropy. With how the simulator is current set up, however, it would take a long, long time, and a ton of clicking. Might be worth asking Afabar to add an option where you can have it run the simulator X times for Y minutes. Glyph of Disease aside, a million 5 minute fights are probably more realistic numbers than a single five million minute fight. <br>
<br>
Anyways, after some discussion with Fargom, we've both agreed to keep the bulk of the DW Unholy info (and the entirety of its discussion, pretty much) in <b>his</b> thread. It simply makes the most sense to both of us, for a number of reasons. I'll keep some basic blurbs up as I have now, but for more in depth info/discussion, his thead is where you're going to want to go.<br>
<br>
Also, the stat weights in Zerack's and the one's here will be brought to match in what I believe will be his next version.<br>
<br>
/cheer for all the threads being in accordance with one another ^^.<br>

</div>With an Unholy Obliterate spec, Armor Pen will never overtake Strength. Not in any attainable gear, anyways (and probably not in any unattainable theoretical gear, either!).

<br>
So on. Generally speaking, Unholy comes within 5-10% of Blood on single target (and, quite obviously, far surpasses Blood in AoE, so I didn't bother linking those sorts of parses). Although, as such, it is certainly still behind Blood in raw dps, it's by a much smaller margin than in 3.1. It's still a bit early to really tell, however, especially when you consider that Unholy will benefit the most from 4p t9 (which could potentially be enough to put it over the top).<br>
<br>
Oddly enough, Unholy outperforms Blood in Kahorie's sim, both pre and post 4p t9. It probably undervalues Hysteria, DRW, and cooldown stacking in general - one of Blood's strengths. It's certainly undervaluing (or overvaluing) <i>something</i>, as there's yet to be any parses reflecting the type of lead the simulator hints at.<br>
<br>
Anyways, when you factor in Unholy's added raid utility, the two are both very attractive raid specs. Neither is flat out superior to the other in overall raid contribution, even if one does beat out the other in raw single target dps. Which you spec should have more to do with which playstyle you enjoy the most, what sort of gear you already have, and what type of raid composition you typically run with than anything else.</div>

Maybe this was already mentioned, but kahorie's simulator doesn't seem to add ebon plague to the list of buffs/debuffs. As far as I can tell this means that in the simulator blood does not get ebon plague, but in most situations blood would get ebon plague. This could be one reason for the damage disparity.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">So has anyone switched to ob UH from blood that could share their results? Currently blood atm, but was wondering if switching to UH would result in a dps loss? The main reason I'm thinking about switching is to provide the sp buff to casters, as we currently don't have an active boomkin, and I would like the locks to save curse for CoD. So I'm curious if the dps gain from EP to the raid would be enough to offset any personal dps I may or may not lose. In addition, I raid with a enh shaman, so our buffs are a bit redundant atm.</div>

</div>I dual spec 3/13/55/new sigil and 51/20, I found the results varied a lot by fight.<br>
<br>
For northrend beasts it was pretty much the same, for jaxx a slight improvement, for faction champs an absolutely enormous improvement, twin valks and anub I hadn't done before this week, and did it as blood as the most comfortable spec.<br>
<br>
For Uld I lost about 1000 dps during 25 man XT normal, but saw significant gains on auriaya and freya. Didn't try kologarn as I was only source of 10% AP at that point.<br>
<br>
It was probably worth it raid wise though, as our casters snuck into the top 10 for the first time in living memory - they've been suffering a lot with our inability to keep an elemental shaman or boomkin for more than 2 weeks.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1374943"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I don't have the parse with me, but here are my observations after using GoD with 3/13/55 for an entire 10 ToC and Northrend Beasts on hard mode... no math, just experience and feel.  I'm very inclined to agree with Consider in that, when executed properly, these fights don't last very long... so the mileage on GoD varies a lot.<br>
<br>
<b>Regular:</b><br>
Beasts - not a bad gain.  We had people with snobolds run in so the melee could help kill them.  It's such an easy fight I saw a nice pickup being able to roll diseases that were put up during greatness, desolation, fallen crusader, and SoV proc.  Worms were a little less of a gain since you can't maintain the diseases when they burrow.  The same is true for Icehowl with being thrown around the arena and being out of range to refresh at times.<br>
<br>
Jaraxxus - if you stay on him as interrupt duty, you can see the gain.  If you are having to run out for portal spawns, you may not get back in time to refresh the diseases.  If you don't, it's a slight loss in my experience.<br>
<br>
Faction Champs - it was really nice here since you can stick to the primary target like glue and keep everything rolling at a high level from target to target.  I did more damage in 10 than I did in 25 as blood or DW frost.  After my original disease application on the pull, I never had to reapply for the entire encounter on any boss.  Once we got down to the last three or so I would DG the burn target closer to the remaining targets so I could pest the diseases to them more easily.<br>
<br>
Twins - I did the same as blood and dw frost here.  Maintaining the diseases with GoD was very easy.<br>
<br>
Anub - I can't compare it to another spec since he was a one shot.  Diseases drop off when he burrows, so it's hard to say whether GoD is worth it here.  It was nice being able to pest him and then switch immediately to an add that already had diseases though.  That cut my number of disease applications down considerably.<br>
<br>
<b>Hard:</b><br>
Beasts - we fell apart here and couldn't down the magnataur even after one shotting everything in normal including Anub after never seeing him.  Healers weren't able to keep everyone healed if we brought the snobolds in because of the stomp.  Having to run out to help with snobolds killed making GoD worthwhile here for me.  I couldn't maintain diseases, so the "rolling" effect was nonexistent for me.  However, we may have just not been doing all the things we needed here, so your experience with time on target may be better than mine, which would give you more benefit from GoD than I received.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">The new SS glyph doesn't work at all on the PTR.<br>
<br>
Bone Shield's 1min cooldown should be nice with a BT macro.<br>

I could modify the sim for 3.2.2, the new SS glyph screams for a sim <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100310023928im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg">.<br>

Edit:<br>
No Dirge on OB is a 250dps loss.<br>
The SS glyph is worth 250dps, compared to no glyph.<br>
Overall you do slightly less dps than now. OB isn't better anymore and the old 12-0-59 is king again.</div>

	</tbody></table>
</div>Aside from allowing a PS+IT-to-SS substitution, the SS glyph also effectively gives 4 additional ticks of diseases over a 60-sec rotation, because the disease ticks will line up perfectly with disease reapplication at 10 ticks 30 seconds apart (instead of 6 ticks 20 seconds apart, giving 18 sec of effective disease uptime every 20 sec).<br>
<br>
However, even with that, I don't see how you can get a 250 DPS increase from the glyph. You get one SS-for-PS+IT substitution every 60 sec. I don't think SS will do 13+k more than PS+IT to account for that kind of DPS increase. With SS in its current obliterated state, the glyph possibly won't give that kind of DPS increase even if it lets SS extend diseases indefinitely.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I´ve done the numbers again with similar results.<br>
<br>
Perhaps we should think about the possibility of the diseases dropping, before they are actually reapplied because of the exact 30 sec duration. <br>
<br>
With Latency they will drop, before reapplied. Because of that the overall Dmg goes down. PS and IT do less dmg. Blood Plague and Frost Fever do less.<br>
<br>
Glyph of UB is only 1.1% of my DMG actually. (12.7% DC DMG)</div>

	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Disease dropping is an overall DPS increase in this case. If you reapplied the disease at the 20+latency-sec mark, the disease would tick 5+latency seconds from the previous tick (which is very close to the worst-case scenario for a refresh); if you reapplied the disease at the 30+latency-sec mark, the disease would tick 3+latency seconds from the previous tick. As long as you reapply BP first, your IT will get the RoR bonus. Over a 60-sec rotation, you effectively gain 4 ticks of disease, which is significantly more damage than you lose from no RoR bonus for PS.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>No, since a few talents and SS have changed since the start of Ulduar, so any previous analysis is void.  Also, back then the simulator wasn't as developed so the previous results could have been faulty.  <br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Disease dropping is an overall DPS increase in this case. If you reapplied the disease at the 20+latency-sec mark, the disease would tick 5+latency seconds from the previous tick (which is very close to the worst-case scenario for a refresh); if you reapplied the disease at the 30+latency-sec mark, the disease would tick 3+latency seconds from the previous tick. As long as you reapply BP first, your IT will get the RoR bonus. Over a 60-sec rotation, you effectively gain 4 ticks of disease, which is significantly more damage than you lose from no RoR bonus for PS.</div>

		<div id="post_message_1383464"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Removed the Epidemic-less builds from the OP. Didn't consider the AoE implications - even if the lack of epidemic + the presence of GoSS are dps gains on single target, they aren't huge ones (&lt;100), and the potential AoE cost just seems way too large (not just from an individual perspective, but from a raid one with EP falling), especially when you consider that is where we shine. You give up too much for too little.<br>
<br>
The one thing I'm questioning is the possibility of 16/0/55 (similar to the old 17/0/54, except Desolation maxed). It comes down to what's superior - 1pt in Necrosis or 1pt in Dark Conviction. Previously, Necrosis won by a small margin, but now? With UB benefitting from crit (the old version didn't) and diseases benefiting from crit (obviously huge)? Might work out. Still can't swap builds in my sim, although it's likely due to user stupidity. Else wise I would test it myself.<br>
<br>
Also, to Moon above, your build is wrong. You cannot sacrifice Wandering Plague. Well, I mean, you could, but you wouldn't want to. Not in any of the various specs being tossed around. It is that much dps on single target (let alone on multiple targets). 7/10/54 could work, but not at the cost of WP.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1383539"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Ah. Many thanks.<br>
<br>
Results over 350 hours. Done with my current gear, so 2t9 and 2t8. If anyone wants to analyze the summaries, I have them all saved to word, but I'm not bothering to post them here, as they're quite space intensive. And, besides, they don't seem to have any oddities to them, so nothing much of interest. Unless you want proof I'm not just pulling numbers out of my magic hat =p:<br>
7/10/54 with GoUB - 7086 DPS<br>
12/0/59 with GoUB - 7236 DPS<br>
16/0/55 with GoUB - 7178 DPS<br>
<br>
Results with 4t9:<br>
7/10/54 with GoUB - 7371 DPS<br>
12/0/59 with GoUB - 7511 DPS<br>
16/0/55 with GoUB - 7508 DPS<br>
<br>
7/10/54 just doesn't cut it. Not sure why Black Ice is coming off so weak, but I suppose it's a mix of the new UB (the old one happened the same time we swapped to Oblit) and the nerfed SS.<br>
<br>
Dark Conviction doesn't quite pull ahead, even with 4p t9, I suppose. Comes quite close though, at least once you get 4t9 - although if it isn't flat out superior, there's no reason to take it, as it doesn't convey any side benefits (if anything, it's more RNG prone, which is a worse thing to most people).<br>
<br>
Working on EP values for 12/0/59 with GoUB, since that does indeed seem to be most ideal at the moment, in case anyone is curious. ArP will probably be way down, but aside from that, I doubt things will shift too significantly.<br>
<br>
Edit: Hmmm. Running through some various specs with the SS glyph, first, I suppose! Better safe than sorry.<br>

11/0/60 + GoSS w/ 4t9 - 7406 DPS<br>
Doesn't quite seem to match up. I can do a few other variations, but doesn't look good, unfortunately.<br>
<br>
11/0/60 + GoUB w/ 2t8 and 2t9 - 7243 DPS<br>
11/0/60 + GoUB w/ 4t9 - 7516 DPS<br>
Higher as you said, although only minutely different than 12/0/59. Still, better is better. <br>

		<div id="post_message_1383557"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->For 12/0/59, it's the same as 11/0/60, simply a point from Necrosis into a point of Bladed Armor. <br>
<br>
But, yeah, Necrosis certainly wins out (although not hugely so, better is better. And, looking to the future, Necrosis will, without a doubt, scale better). I'll add it to my previous post, but:<br>
11/0/60 + GoUB w/ 2t8 and 2t9 - 7243 DPS<br>
11/0/60 + GoUB w/ 4t9 - 7516 DPS<br>
<br>
Quite interesting. Beats 12/0/59.<br>
<br>
Edit: Doing 11/0/60, but taking a point from Bladed Armor and putting it into Dark Conviction (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100310023928/http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?deathknight#_CJyG88M_S7b1,FQJ,10433" target="_blank">http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?deat...S7b1,FQJ,10433</a> 1/5 in a talent and 3/5 in another is odd - I hate incomplete talents, but whatever!) seemed a possibility with 4t9, so I tried it. 7522 dps - a winner!<br>
<br>
Sooo, yeah. Necrosis &gt; Dark Conviction &gt; Bladed Armor, it would appear, although the differences are all single digit.<br>

</div>On the topic of the SS glyph--does the simulator clip diseases?  Standard rotation will always clip the last tick of FF/BP, which trades diseased IT/PS damage for a tick of FF/BP.  However, with 30s diseases, assuming more or less ideal dps conditions (no unexpected rune delays), it will be possible to get all ten ticks of FF/BP while still keeping 100% EP uptime, so while your PS won't benefit from RoR, IT should.  The upshot of this is that in addition to an extra SS every minute, you gain two additional ticks of both diseases.  Of course, there is only one GCD's lag time available to refresh your first disease (and keep EP up) before your second disease will fall off.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I was wondering how the simulator handles this, since this is easily the sort of behavior that could swing dps by 100 either way.  Does it attempt to clip diseases with a standard priority-based rotation, or will it always wait for diseases to fall off?

		<div id="post_message_1383633"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The subversion buff and the dirge nerf are, however, so it's a somewhat moot point. SS Unholy will overtake Oblit Unholy and it will be at next to no dps loss - so Blizzard accomplished its goal, even if it wasn't exactly by the means they expected.<br>
<br>
Besides, if Glyph of Scourge Strike was the significant factor, then Glyph of Unholy Blight becomes worthless. Is the opposite really any worse? <br>
<br>
As well, it's not so much that GoSS is bad than the fact that due to AoE reasons, you can't go GoSS + No Epidemic (if you could, it would be a contender). If they could somehow make GoSS increase the duration of all of your active FF/BP diseases by 3 seconds until the cap of 9, or something of that nature, than it would be fine. Without redoing the Glyph completely, however, there is no other way to make it viable due to the AoE constraints (you could make it have no cap on the extension which would make it stellar for single targets, but that still wouldn't fix the AoE issues).<br>

</div>True, and thus you would want to go 16/0/55. It's still valuable to know, however, which talents are superior in terms of strictly single targets, and determining the differences. <br>

That said, I'm sure most people would willingly trade ~20 ST dps for several (several) times that AoE dps.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

With Frost, Tundra Stalker does not affect Frost Fever ticks unless it is reapplied with IT (or HB glyph) with a Frost Fever already affecting the target (yours or someone else's).<br>

I am not at luxury to test this at the moment, but perhaps this applies to RoR as well? If we Plague Strike right after BP drops, will the BP ticks be increased by 10% from RoR?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1383658"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Curious. Even without the 9s restriction, you would still have to refresh diseases eventually, I suppose, which would explain why it's still not worth it. At 5 (assuming you don't have to IT/PS) SSes per 20 seconds, you're only extending it by 15 seconds, meaning you're losing time on the debuff regardless. <br>
<br>
Any which way, even if they made the glyph give 6 seconds to your diseases without a cap (or, for simplicity's sake, just make it work like Glyph of Disease - except it would be better due to not causing you to lose a BS every 20 seconds), thus allowing you to never have to reapply IT/PS, it would still have the AoE issue (which I so overlooked at first glance). Going the GoD route would be interesting, though, and could have potential... <br>
<br>
Speaking of that, I'ld be curious (if you have the time and/or inclination) if you could calculate what sort of dps that would be - if GoSS essentially read something along the lines of, "Your Scourge Strike ability now refreshes disease durations on your primary target as well as any target within 10 yards back to their maximum duration" where it followed the exact same mechanics of GoD, except with the 10 yard addition to get rid of the pesky AoE issue the current glyph causes.<br>
<br>
Another alternative would be if they caused GoSS to simply refresh Blood Plague to max duration (and BP alone). What that would cause you to do is then substitute a PS for a Ghoul Frenzy every 20 seconds. With a slight change to Ghoul Frenzy (lower the duration to 20 seconds, slightly buff the haste - or cause the haste to also apply to you, perhaps, to a lesser degree? - or make the haste also increase the rate at which the Ghoul regenerates energy), it would actually make GF worthwhile, while also giving GoSS its place. <br>
<br>
At any rate, the GoSS change was simply a means to an end, and the end was reached regardless. Although it being viable would be nice, it's not all that big of a deal, as there are plenty of worthless (or suboptimal - one in the same, to most people) glyphs out there.<br>
<br>
Edit: Some random info from the Blood thread which is probably of interest here: 4p t9 works off your melee crit rate. As well, similar to how it "snapshots" your AP with Glyph of Disease and then "rolls" the highest to date, it "snapshots" your crit rate. Aside from a few rare trinkets - Dark Matter, specifically - this doesn't matter a ton, since your crit rate doesn't fluctuate like your AP, but still. Something worth noting. I'm sure there are ways out there to take advantage of it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I haven't looked at the amth on this but every second without diseases on target is a second without Ebon Plagubringer buff (13% to spell damage taken), which would hurt all spell based dps your whole raid delivers during that time. So I'd rather refresh early than late.<br>
<br>
----------------------------------<br>
<br>
I did some napkin math trying to figure out why 7+ points in Blood clocks better DPS than 10+ points in Frost. The difference between the two is Butchery+Subversion+2H-spec vs. ImpIT+RPM+Black Ice. For simplicity I’ll leave Butchery and RPM out of calculations.<br>
<br>
Assuming that Melee is 13%, Scourge Strike is 13% of your DPS, Deathcoil is 13% of your DPS, Blood Strike is 5%, Plague Strike is 4% and Icy Touch is 4% of your DPS the breakdown would be following:<br>
<br>
ImpIT + Black Ice (Icy Touch) =  1,15*1,10*0,05 = 1,325% dps<br>
Black Ice (Scourge Strike) = 1,10*0,13 = 1,3% dps<br>
Black Ice (Deathcoil) = 1,10*0,13 = 1,3% dps<br>
TOTAL 	3,925% dps<br>
<br>
2-H Spec (Melee) = 1,04*0,13 = 0,52%<br>
Subversion+2-H Spec (Scourge Strike) = 1,09*1,04*0,13 = 1,737% dps<br>
Subversion+2-H Spec (Blood Strike) = 1,09*1,04*0,05 = 0,567% dps<br>
Subversion+2-H Spec (Plague Strike) = 1,09*1,04*0,03 = 0,4% dps<br>
TOTAL 	3,224% dps<br>
<br>
Unless my math is badly off in some point (for example if Blood Strike is actually a lot more than 5% of total dps) the difference must be lying not in Subversion+2-H Spec but the fact that they aren’t that so much worse than Black Ice that it would make up for the dps increase of Bladed Armor+Dark Conviction scaling to our pets and Dark Conviction also gives more wandering plague procs.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1383999"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->As to a point from Desolation to Bladed Armor, I was considering that. Although it is, quite obviously, a single target dps loss (currently simming how much), like you said, it is an AoE damage gain (so long as it's worth BBing over BSing), and if the whole reason you're going 16/0/55 over 11/0/60 is because of the slight loss in single target damage for AoE damage, it's quite likely you'll just want to go 17/0/54. <br>
<br>
Loss of about ~6 dps (relative to 16/0/54) and ~14 dps (relative to 11/0/60).<br>
<i>(7508 with 17/0/54 and 7514 with 16/0/54. Looking back to my post yesterday, 7508 is actually what I got for 16/0/54, meaning the two are within the RNG margin of another. )</i><br>
<br>
The AoE gain is difficult to calculate since it all comes down to how many targets, but it is definitely a gain in any situation where you BB over BS. Most likely a fairly decent gain (when compared to how little you lose).<br>
<br>
Just one caveat, obvious as it may be - 17/0/54 (and 16/0/55) essentially require 4pt9. Although they are still AoE dps gains without it, the gain is much smaller, while the single target loss is much larger, so I doubt many would consider it worth it until the set bonus. Until then you will want to go either 11/0/60 (with 4 points in Bladed Armor, not 3 in BA and 1 in Dark Conviction) or 12/0/59 (maxed BA, 4/5 Nec), the former being slightly stronger for single target, the latter winning for AoE.<br>

</div>As I said, just was curious, nothing more or less ^^. Just was wondering if it's possible for GoSS to be an upgrade in any disease refreshing/extending manner, or if it's going to always lose out until they go in a completely different direction with it. I know it is what it is, hence all of the previous sim results which didn't even entertain the possibility.<br>

</div>The sim handles it as a priority, and the exact same priority as you would have without the glyph (Blood Plague &gt; Frost Fever &gt; DC if RP capped &gt; SS &gt; BS &gt; DC &gt; Horn). That does mean that diseases fall off before you reapply, most likely (at least BP), but that's no different than without the glyph, so it wouldn't favor one spec over the other.<br>

</div>All the possible variations of the BI spec I tried failed to compete. That said, I didn't try Epidemic-less builds for the AoE reasons - even so, if going the Epidemic-free route is ideal on a single target, it would still be better to 'minor' in Blood. Black Ice simply doesn't scale as it used to.<br>
<br>
Edit: Currently working on 17/0/54 stat weights, as I see that being the spec most people will use in BiS. Once those are done, I'll also do 11/0/60 and 12/0/59, as the latter seems best pre-4pt9 in AoE (with only the single digit dps cost on a single target), and the former seems best in single target (although only slightly so at the cost of AoE, as already discussed a bunch of times). Those are probably the three specs I'll be including in any depth come patch day on the OP, unless something changes, someone sees a possibility which everyone else missed, or someone has a real good argument for including something else.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
On the plus side, crit is up in value, but that's more due to diseases critting than anything else, and as such isn't too SS/patch specific (although SS's larger crit modifier does help). On the down side, ArP is (obviously and expectedly) way down in value, and haste loses a bit of it's attractiveness (due to no Necrosis). <br>
<br>
Nothing surprising, really. I'll probably be done with the other stat weights later this afternoon/some time this evening, but if anyone wants to calculate a BiS set, these are the numbers you (probably) want to be using, at least for the time being.<br>
<br>
In other news, in the blood thread they've been doing some 4p t9 testing, and WP (what WP has to do with Blood is past me, but whatever!) will do double damage if the tick it procs off was a crit. Which makes WP all that more essential and all that much more of a dps boost. The sim was already making this assumption from what I could tell, but regardless, confirmation is always a plus.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Curious. Even without the 9s restriction, you would still have to refresh diseases eventually, I suppose, which would explain why it's still not worth it. At 5 (assuming you don't have to IT/PS) SSes per 20 seconds, you're only extending it by 15 seconds, meaning you're losing time on the debuff regardless. <br>
<br>
Any which way, even if they made the glyph give 6 seconds to your diseases without a cap (or, for simplicity's sake, just make it work like Glyph of Disease - except it would be better due to not causing you to lose a BS every 20 seconds), thus allowing you to never have to reapply IT/PS, it would still have the AoE issue (which I so overlooked at first glance). Going the GoD route would be interesting, though, and could have potential... <br>
<br>
Speaking of that, I'ld be curious (if you have the time and/or inclination) if you could calculate what sort of dps that would be - if GoSS essentially read something along the lines of, "Your Scourge Strike ability now refreshes disease durations on your primary target as well as any target within 10 yards back to their maximum duration" where it followed the exact same mechanics of GoD, except with the 10 yard addition to get rid of the pesky AoE issue the current glyph causes.<br>
<br>
Another alternative would be if they caused GoSS to simply refresh Blood Plague to max duration (and BP alone). What that would cause you to do is then substitute a PS for a Ghoul Frenzy every 20 seconds. With a slight change to Ghoul Frenzy (lower the duration to 20 seconds, slightly buff the haste - or cause the haste to also apply to you, perhaps, to a lesser degree? - or make the haste also increase the rate at which the Ghoul regenerates energy), it would actually make GF worthwhile, while also giving GoSS its place. <br>
<br>
At any rate, the GoSS change was simply a means to an end, and the end was reached regardless. Although it being viable would be nice, it's not all that big of a deal, as there are plenty of worthless (or suboptimal - one in the same, to most people) glyphs out there.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Changing GoSS to work like GoD will add some DPS due to the "high-proc disease rolling" effect (including RoR for BP), which, in addition to the higher effective disease uptime, may end up being pretty close to GoUB in practice. The SS substitution aspect of the glyph will still be a bust, though. The problem isn't so much that the glyph doesn't let you make enough SS substitutions; the problem is the SS substitutions themselves just aren't worth that much (if anything at all).<br>
<br>
With the numbers for Bensch78's gear selection from his last post, without the higher effective disease uptime, substituting SS for PS+IT+5rp is actually a DPS loss <i>before even counting RoR</i>. With different gear selection, you can get a very slight gain per SS substitution (instead of a loss in Bensch78's case), but the most you can get is 1 substitution per 20 sec, so unless the gain from 1 substitution is substantial (which it isn't), you just won't get much of a gain.<br>
<br>
I don't know what "the end" is for Blizzard. If it's to get Unholy not to use OB, then it's reached; if it's to do so without netting a DPS loss for 2H Unholy, then it's still a good glyph away as far as I can tell. If you give Blizzard devs the benefit of the doubt and assume they aren't bad enough to overestimate a flat change like adding SS to Subversion, then judging from Ghostcrawler's comments, they are aiming for the latter, but overestimated the gain from the new GoSS.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>In terms of clearing trash ya it was nice, but these forums aren't about trash clears. On boss fights it's essentially useless as there is generally no available corpse to explode but your own ghoul. It's been proven in the past that exploding your ghoul does not make up for the DPS loss of having no pet while you wait for the CD to summon another one. Also for consideration is the fact your ghoul will have been buffed before a boss pull which means your next ghoul will do less damage since it doesn't have the buffs. Virtually all DKs skip this talent because the situations where it might be useful are so far and few between that the point is better served elsewhere. This could change for Icecrown, but since we know nothing about it yet speculation is not worth the time.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Really though, although you are free to take it (take the point from the same talent you would take points for IUP/GF from), it's obviously not a boost on single target, and I don't consider it to be one on AoE, as AoE outside of bosses is largely irrelevant. Trash is cool and all but it's nonexistent in the current tier of raiding (and even were it, the spell simply has too many limitations for little of a gain). Fun it may be, but optimal in the vast majority of situations it is not. <br>

</div>Desolation &gt; Necrosis &gt; Bladed Armor (for single target)<br>
Bladed Armor &gt; Necrosis &gt; Desolation (for AoE situations)<br>
<br>
In a situation where you aren't completely AoEing but you are simply using Pestilence (meaning you are not bothering with DnD or Blood Boil. Probably something like Faction Champions) Desolation easily pulls ahead of Necrosis, and may pull ahead of Bladed Armor (depends on your gear level).<br>
<br>
I put in a "food chain" for those three talents (plus Dark Conviction) in the OP, for both single target and AoE situations, so people experimenting with specs have an idea where each talent lies in relation to one another and why some of the trade offs are made. I also added the remainder of the stat weights to the OP (the ones I posted + the weapon dps/speed results + the set bonus results). <br>
<br>
I double-checked the specs, and there should be no errors in them; they're exactly what has been being talked about. I'll probably change around the spec section tomorrow. The best way to think about speccing in 3.2.2 is as going 7/0/53 with the remaining 11 points being spec in the various combinations depending on your gear (whether or not you have 4p t9, essentially) and whether you want to min-max your single target damage as much as you can for the AoE loss(es). <br>
<br>
Also added in the new BS nerf, although it hardly affects us (4 -&gt; 3 charges baseline, 2 -&gt; 1 charge from the glyph).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Looking at this numbers you are gaining roughly 50 dps... don´t have any trouble with Blood Tap destroying your rotation... ARP will be a little bit more valuable... 2PCT9 will proc more often... <br>

		<div id="post_message_1387425"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->With the way Death Runes and Blood Tap work right now Blood Tapping after Blood Striking will drop the Death Rune back to a Blood Rune. After doing an FU strike with Death Runes while all your runes are on cooldown is the best time to refresh bone shield for sure.<br>
<br>
You'll also want to cancel Blood Tap after you use it, if the Blood Tap buff fades after a Blood Strike, the upcoming Death Rune will get thrown back to a Blood Rune.<br>
<br>
It wasn't always like this, Blizzard has made quite a few unannounced changes to the rune system from time to time. For example, having a Blood Strike avoided used to instantly create a Death Rune, but that was "fixed" some time ago.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1388000"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->When both my Death Runes are up (and before any Unholy runes refresh) I hit Bone Shield and then Blood Tap. Obliterate. Macro to cancel the Blood Tap buff (so it doesn't cause any of those random yet irritating blood/death rune issues). Smoothest way I've found to handle things without it messing up your rotation (which this shouldn't - it takes a GCD to refresh Bone Shield, but that's just how BS works regardless of when you use it, and you should have the extra to spare anyways).<br>
<br>
Anyways, unfortunately, all of that talk is soon to be quite irrelevant. <br>
<br>
Bensch is indeed right. Doing 17/0/54 with and without Reaping, as well as 11/0/60 with and without Reaping, Reaping definitely loses. No question. The average SS is approximately ~6500 (depending on which spec and such) while the average BS is ~3200 (once again, depending on which spec). Three talent points for an extra 100 damage every 20 seconds (5 dps) just isn't worth it. And it is really that simple since SS and 2 BS both generate the same amount of RP, and we have the extra GCD to spare so the latter isn't any hassle in that regard. 3 points in Necrosis/Desolation/Bladed Armor/Dark Conviction (which they go in all depends on which spec you are, and whether you are pre 4p t9 or post 4p t9) easily wins out. My sim (of which I did many) results were showing it to be more like a 60-70 dps increase instead of a 50 one as Bensch was getting, but either way, it's definitely a single target dps increase. It's also an AoE one as Reaping has zero value in that regard already, but whatever talent you take will at least give you something.<br>
<br>
I can rerun the EP values tomorrow (as well as the ones for other specs, which I keep pushing off), but it should increase the value of ArP by about ~15%ish. Still makes it a horrible stat, relatively speaking, but at least it will beat out agility and post-melee-pre-spell-cap hit. Crit may change slightly in value too, but nothing which will affect gearing. Everything else should be the same, more or less.<br>
<br>
Has the side effect of giving Desolation better uptime (which, simmed, won't show, but in reality, will certainly help) and, as said, giving 2p t9 slightly better uptime as well (not terribly so because of the ICD, but still, higher is higher, so a definite plus).<br>
<br>
I've editted the OP to reflect all of this (since I don't really see it being disproved. The math is very basic and very easy. If anything, I'm kinda surprised how no one thought of it before - or at least thought to prove it and then post of it. Disappointed in myself!). Barring any actual changes to the PTR, this is probably (hopefully) the last thing which will change the specs.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I feel it has the right balance between AOE talents (bladed armor / dark conviction) and ST dps talents (Desolation, which will have a better uptime now and make more use of the t9 2set bonus). Though im still debating whether or not to put points in necrosis, as it really is a good talent. The obvious answer would perhaps be IUP, but having farmed ToC for a while now, i still argue it is an excellent talent (especially so for hard modes).<br>

I guess that we'll see how much Blizzard thinks we should use Death runes, and if it's ok for us to dps without utilizing them. As long as the talents stay as they are, it seems we'll have to spec either way depending on the strength of SS at the time. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100227100017im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg"><!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Blood's DRM and Unholy's Reaping both have never given dps benefits beyond making Death Runes, so the devs likely feel satisfied in how they are working.  The devs are scared to buff SS even more (due to PvP, the 9% crit talent likely will not be taken by PvPers), so don't expect a Reaping buff.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>As it was stated before Reaping is NOT a broken talent, as its main function is to make death runes, and it will still do that.  1x SS still hits harder than 2x BS on average, but its the three talent points you gain that push it over the edge.  All PvP builds will still continue to take Reaping.  <br>
<br>
Playing without Reaping in PvE doesn't mean its a broken talent, and isn't something major that needs to be addressed.  If anything I'm quite happy to have an extra 3 points freed up.<br>
<br>

<br>
On another note I have an idea here that maybe you can check out Consider (can't run sims atm, on a macbook).<br>
<br>
Using GoDD, GoGhoul, and GoD with a rotation like so after diseases are up with all procs:<br>
<br>
SS - SS - BS - BS<br>
SS - SS - BS - PS<br>

My quick napkin math says its a stretch to be viable, but its worth a shot.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
While not quite as glaring as the Enhancement Shaman situation (i.e., SS/LL/ES) that contributed to the /castrandom change in 3.2, no Death Runes takes Unholy one step closer to the whole "press whatever isn't on cooldown for maximum dps" problem. There are several clear signals and some explicit statements that Blizzard wants more thought required/skill involved in optimal effectiveness, which makes the Reaping change odd/notable.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Much like Unholy using Obliterate over Scourge Strike being weird, Reaping being a mathematically undesirable talent for raiding isn't terribly game breaking, but it is unintentional. Reaping is a more active talent than most, so it will probably be adjusted. I could see it being baked into another talent like Outbreak or something.<br>

		<div id="post_message_1389402"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Not taking Reaping is not nearly the same thing as not taking Scourge Strike. That is a flawed comparison in many, many ways. Reaping is a dps increase - a very small one. If you had the choice between 3 talent points in Reaping and 3 talent points unspent, you would be best off placing them in Reaping. Scourge Strike, currently, is a dps decrease. If you had the choice between 1 talent point in Scourge Strike (just assume Outbreak is maxed out or w/e) and 1 talent point unspent, you would be better with the 1 talent point unspent. That was (well, is, until 3.2.2) the issue - Scourge Strike is inferior to nothing (well, to Obliterate, which costs us nothing to be able to use). Reaping, on the other hand, is simply inferior to other talents, which is perfectly acceptable - some talents have always been and will always be stronger than others, that's simply how it is. <br>
<br>
Thus drawing parallels between the two is just impossible. If two Blood Strikes outdamaged one Scourge Strike, there would be an issue, but that isn't the case. <br>
<br>
The talent still has its place in PvP - where death runes are much more valuable, partially because the gap between SS and 2x BS widens, and partially because being able to CoI and junk off a blood rune can be priceless. <br>
<br>
Unintentional it probably is, but a major issue (I would argue) it certainly is not.<br>
<br>
Unholy will use the same priority system it always has, so I don't see the above mentioned "press whatever isn't on cooldown for maximum dps problem" any more of a problem then as it is now. Skill will come down less to how you handle your rotation (which, let's be honest, has always been pretty simple for Unholy. And for Blood, for that matter) and more to the little things - maximizing AMS for RP, keeping your Ghoul alive, timing your Gargoyle as optimally as possible, knowing how many targets it's worth pesting on, knowing how many targets it's worth flatout AoEing on, knowing when to pop a potion, starting a fight with max RP, so on and so forth. It's all those little things which will - and always have - separated the good Unholys from the bad, not the rotation.<br>

</div>That wouldn't actually change SoV uptime from what it is in the OP. For SoV uptime to increase you would have to separate your first SS and your last by a larger period of time, which those rotation doesn't do. SoV will still have a crazy high uptime, anyways, just not quite as high. Also, due to its CD, changing the rotation to what you suggest wouldn't actually change 2p T9 uptime.<br>

I was still at work when you posted this, and am now currently running EP values (I had set them to finish while I was gone but apparently my laptop wasn't plugged in and it died =S), but I can do so later this evening if no one else has. Not taking Reaping doesn't actually have any affect on the value of a Pest build though. If a Pest rotation is viable with Reaping, it's viable without - or the opposite. With the introduction of the simulator being able to do X hours worth of Y second fights, it was previously shown that going the GoD route was not worth it, but that was in 3.2. Perhaps the presence of talents like Bladed Armor and such will shift things. I'll give it a go later, although I am somewhat skeptical - especially when you consider the nature of a lot of TotC/TotGC fights. Still, if it's a dps increase, it's a dps increase.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1389524"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->In regards to Glyph of Disease builds, I had a chat with one of my guildies (Zek, author of X-perl) somedays ago about making a mod that would track the "power" of current diseases on your target (to ease knowing if you should refresh with Glyph of Disease before the end of duration, or cast new ones). Well, he made a mod called BleedingHearts. It tracks what your AP was when you last cast diseases, as well as have a meter for what your current AP is. It's made for disease rolling, and with freeing up a glyph spot as well as fixing T9 4 piece in 3.2.2, people might wish to give it a try. Link provided below;<br>

As predicted, ArP went up by almost exactly 15% in value (/pats self on back).  Everything else was roughly the same (or if it was different, the difference was explainable - such as with the t7 set bonuses) except for expertise and hit - they both went down (slightly) in value, and I'm not completely sure why. If anything I would have expected the opposite, as you have less free gcds. I'll run the numbers again to see if it was just some sort of fluke, I suppose, but still; I don't think it is - these numbers should be pretty accurate - but I just can't think of an explanation for it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Not really. Even without Reaping, you still have a free GCD a minute, so it's actually a buff if you aren't getting extra RP from AMS/Revitalize/etc, as BT + BS does generate 20 RP (and 20 RP + 0 damage &gt; 0 damage!). If you are getting extra RP from one of those various sources, you would still be better off BT + BSing over HoWing (as 20 RP &gt; 10 RP). Unless you are getting so much RP that you can drop every Horn from your rotation, it's a buff. A slight one, but definitely a buff. <br>
<br>
Not that it was probably intended as such. Not that it was probably intended as a dps nerf, either. I'm sure it was a purely tanking-oriented change, and they figured it would have so slight an effect on dps (if one at all) that it wouldn't matter. And it hardly does. But that oh so slight effect was positive, no doubt.<br>
<br>
They also changed the wording on GoSS, but I think it's simply a tooltip clarification to show that it will extend Ebon Plague as well.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Looking at this numbers you are gaining roughly 50 dps... don´t have any trouble with Blood Tap destroying your rotation... ARP will be a little bit more valuable... 2PCT9 will proc more often... <br>

Perhaps someone can do the sims on his own to prove my statements or to show me, how foolish i am...<br>

</div>I don't know if anybody still remembers the 13-GCD rotations discussion from way back. The gist of it is, unlike Frost, Unholy can realistically have 2 free GCDs when raid-buffed if you design your rotation properly and you do not have high effective latency. When I manually modeled Reapingless builds like the one you posted, I found them to be around 150~200 DPS loss compared to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100304130157/http://www.wowhead.com/?talent#jfVMVZZfzhI0cdg0ux0uIqo:LsbMmV" target="_blank">GoIT 17-0-54</a> type builds running 2xIT rotations along the line of:<br>
<br>
SS&gt;BS&gt;BS&gt;dc&gt;PS&gt;IT<br>
SS&gt;dc&gt;SS&gt;dc&gt;PS&gt;IT(&gt;dc)<br>
<br>
The use frequency of the final DC is close to 100%, because the rotation is able to carry a full DC worth of RP in reserve to drain 2 RP at a time without going over.<br>
<br>
Timing tests on dummies from way back showed that, with 150 haste rating and raid buffs, the effective latency threshold for executing 7-strike-6-spell rotations was around 155-160 ms. However, I have yet to see an existing tool capable of modeling this correctly. For example, I don't know if it's a rune timing/rotation modeling issue or something else I am missing, but Kalorie's sim calculates the effective latency threshold for executing 13-GCD Unholy rotations to be about 25-30 ms as far as I can tell.<br>
<br>
You can get around that problem by simply setting the sim to run at 25-30 ms latency or lower. However, there is an additional problem with the way it models disease tick timing. When I used the sim as a cross-check for my own numbers, the sim would inexplicably lose ~3-4% of disease ticks when running 13-GCD rotations even when set to below the threahold (50-60 ms effective latency is about as low as I can go personally in practice, and even at that effective latency I am nowhere near the point where I can go below 6 ticks per 20 sec).<br>
<br>
I can't think of an easy way to get aruond the second problem when using the sim; figuring the phantom disease tick loss in manually puts the sim about 60-70 DPS off of my numbers.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

It isn't as if the strikes are on a cooldown separate from the rune refresh. As soon as blood tap goes off, all the single rune strikes become available.<br>

</div>We seem to be having this discussion on 2 forums now.<br>
<br>
But on live, right now, I use that Blood tap and that free GCD to slot in an extra Blood Strike on single mobs, or a BB on an AOE pack. That also generates 20 RP.<br>
<br>
So now I have to waste 5 runes every 5 minutes instead of 1 rune every 5 minutes. 4 unholy runes = 4 PS which is at least 4k damage lost every 5 minutes. 4 death runes lost every 5 minutes is much worse. At least it is 4 Blood Strike lost, which is closer to 8k damage lost every 5 minutes.<br>
<br>
I am going to ask again. for all those folks that are using Blood Tap and Bone shield to generate 20 RP. Why the hell wouldn't you use that Blood Tap death rune to Blood strike? Please explain.<br>
<br>
TLDR, BT+Blood Strike = 20RP+2k damge &gt;&gt;BT+Bone Shield =20RP +0 damage<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1389908"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Clark, remember that Bone Shield grants a 2% damage buff while active, and while I don't know how much that would add up to on average, I'm fairly sure it's 2k or more over the course of a fight per minute. If you never used the Blood Tap to use it, you'd lose that or else lose damage keeping it up without the extra blood Tap rune (via destroying a SS cast).<br>

Granted if Bone shield ends very fast in a specific fight with lots of AoE, possibly the Blood Strike would be higher. But if that is the case, perhaps something could be said for the low maintenance you are in that kind of scenario.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1390007"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The Epidemic-less results are interesting, but the problem is AoE. On a single target, it's essentially a matter of PS + IT verse SS, and similar to 2x BS, although the SS wins out, it isn't by much, and the extra talent points/RP apparently push the first option over. But on multiple targets? No epidemic also comes at the cost of additional pestilences as well, pestilences which could be blood boils or parts of DnDs.<br>
<br>
For clarification, the problem isn't the same problem as with GoSS and no epidemic. There, on top of this issue, you also had GoSS becoming useless. GoIT obviously still functions when AoEing.<br>
<br>
Like anything regarding AoE, it's a pain to actually work the numbers, since it all comes down to how many targets. That said, if your numbers are accurate (which I'm not questioning, simply haven't done it for myself yet) it might be worth the trade off as the gain is larger than the miniscule 11/0/60 gain. Although, speaking of such, the more points you take out of stuff like Epidemic and Reaping, the more identical the two builds become. The difference between 11/0/60 and 17/0/54, assuming Epidemic and Reaping become no-gos, is a single talent point. There becomes almost no point in differentiating the two. <br>
<br>
Then again, perhaps the two builds of choice won't be 11/0/60 or 17/0/54 but, instead, 17/0/54 with Epidemic and 16/0/55 without Epidemic. You take the latter and you gain 60ish dps on single targets at whatever the AoE cost is or you take the former. Might be the best way to present the choice in the OP. Decisions, decisions.<br>
<br>
Any which way, such a rotation also has the side benefit of being the shortest - which means that stuff like switching targets, having to run out/back in, so on and so forth become less painful as there's a smaller window for it to mess things up (and if you have to restart your rotation from scratch, there's less dps loss since the rotation is smaller).<br>
<br>
Also, despite using the most GCDs, the spec is probably the most latency/error/etc friendly since the disease duration is longest relative to how often they're applied.<br>
<br>
Does hurt the value of SoV a bit more than the lack of Reaping did, but that doesn't matter that much.<br>
<br>
____________________________________________<br>
<br>
I didn't realize that macro no longer worked, my apologies. I simply took it straight from the previous thread. Consider it removed.<br>
<br>
____________________________________________<br>
<br>
Edit:<br>
<br>
Running the sims, the gap I got between the two specs was actually somewhat larger (I used my own current gear as opposed to the default 2H set, which could explain some sort of scaling difference between the two, which would actually be a good thing. I dislike the default 2H set due to the high amount of AP and low amount of Str, personally, which is why I usually don't use it. Not to mention the fact that most people are getting more and more TotC gear by the week, so basing spec choices on a previous tier's gear level is kinda silly. Although it's odd that you're numbers are individually higher than mine. /shrug).<br>
<br>
17/0/54 without Reaping, with Epidemic, with Glyph of Unholy Blight: 7860 DPS<br>
17/0/54 without Reaping, without Epidemic, with Glyph of Icy Touch: 7952 DPS<br>
<br>
Closer to a 100 dps difference. Worth the 1 BB per 20 seconds you lose on AoE? A personal choice but, the more I think about it, and the more I look at my various parses, I'm going to have to go with yes. There's only one fight in CC where you even use Blood Boil - hard Anub - and even then, you aren't using it constantly. Looking at my 30ish wipes on the fight last week, BB seemed to average between 2.5% and 5% of my overall damage. If no epidemic cuts the number of Blood Boils you do in half (which it very nearly does), that's 1.25% to 2.5% of one's damage on an AoE fight like that lost. In return you gain ~100ish dps which is an approximate 1.5% gain on a single target and a 1%ish gain on an AoE encounter. So you gain ~100ish dps on a single target and lose ~100ish dps on an AoE encounter. Seems worth the trade off to me.<br>
<br>
Also, irrelevant but amusing - without Epidemic and Reaping, Scourge Strike drops to less of our overall damage than Blood Strike. <br>
<br>
Actually, looking at it, 2x BS does outdamage 1x SS, in either spec. I'm not sure if that's because of the different weapon (when I previously did the sims I was using an ilvl 232 - Aesir's Edge - now I'm using an ilvl 245 - Lothar's Edge - which is quite a gap in weapon damage) and BS simply scales better or what. Odd. So much for Reaping simply being a small dps gain as to a dps loss.<br>
<br>
For those curious about the specifics, 1 BS was 3367-3377 damage, on average, between the various parses of the various specs. 1 SS, on the other hand, was ~6634 (almost exactly every time).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1390053"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hm...<br>
<br>
Let´s look at the possible AoE-dps-loss without epidemic.<br>
<br>
Let´s look at 5 Targets... possibly a good example, because of Anub´arak 25 Heroic. There are 4 adds and anub himself.<br>
<br>
<br>
Napkin Math:<br>
<br>
Would you only do one pestilence in 20 Seconds like you do now, you just lose one tick one every target. (the 18th second-tick). Because of that, you would lose 8 ticks (4xFF, 4xBP) and the Raid would loose the 13%. Not an Option.<br>
<br>
<br>
Now let´s do a pestilence every 10 Seconds... you would lose one BB on 5 Targets... would be roundabout 10k dmg... 500 dps loss in an AoE Encounter like Anub. That´s a pretty static AoE Encounter. <br>
<br>
<br>
But when you face a AoE Encounter like Thorim, you would have to use Pest more often. You won´t lose anything while dropping epidemic. You would have to switch target very often. Perhabs it would even be a dps gain. <br>
<br>
<br>
I think it all comes down to personal preference.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1390065"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->HM Anub actually isn't all that static of an AoE encounter. You won't be AoEing during burrow phases, yet you will be dpsing then (scarabs). As well, assuming your dps is as it should be, there will probably be gaps between when one set of adds die and the next get in range, during which time you obviously won't be BBing. It is certainly an AoE centric fight, but it's not merely AoEing from 100% -&gt; 0%.<br>
<br>
Yogg+0 is probably the best AoE fight in the game - the most mobs, the mobs never die, you never have to move (as a melee dpser), etc - and even there, looking at the top parse on wmo, Blood Boil is only 5% of the guy's total damage, which was the upperbound of my estimate. /shrug<br>
<br>
I do agree on it being personal preference although, for me, I'm thinking it's an easy decision ^^.<br>
<br>
Any which way, I'll update the OP once again, as soon as I decide how to present the different specs.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

You won´t lose that much AoE-Power while dropping Epidemic, but you will have a single-target dps increase, simplicity of the rotation and much room for error.<br>

Edit: With Anub stationary i just pointed out, that you have to AoE for a while. (The Adds outlast 10 seconds). Just forgot about Yogg + 0<br>

This would be another Single-Target-dps increase. <br>

The question however is, do you really use D&amp;D every 15 seconds in AoE-Encounters, then it would be a AoE-dps-loss.<br>
<br>
Or do you use D&amp;D every 20 seconds to fit better into your rotation? Then you would notice no difference in AoE at all.<br>

		<div id="post_message_1390188"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->It seems to me that players who tend to get a lot of RP from revitalize/rapture and those who use AMS frequently (there are plenty of opportunities in TOC, just like ulduar) will find less of a dps discrepancy between an Icy Touch-no epidemic build than those who don't.  The RP from outside sources when I raid seems to fill about half of my rotations with enough RP to skip HOW and fill in a DC in its place, and if I manage to AMS soak it can actually take a minute or so to bleed off the extra RP in our free GCDs.<br>
<br>
When that is taken into consideration, it seems that the extra RP in an epidemic-free IT glyph *almost* becomes moot.  However, that is my experience, the mileage this setup provides may vary.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Has anyone found a macro that makes Raise Ally work right anymore? Cause rezzing someone midfight was one of my favorite things to do pre-3.1 and I have no idea why they can't fix it like it used to be.<br>

</div>I found the easiest way to deal with Raise Ally is to forget it exists because it has a 15 minute cooldown now.<br>
<br>
Er, wait, I mean use raid frames. Ever since Freya's Detonating Lasher adds, I've had the default UI raid frames out on one side of my screen so I could see the health of everyone else in the raid in case I have some sort of influence over their survival. With raid frames up it's easy to click on whoever is dead and use Raise Ally, assuming the frames don't bug out and not let me select players like they do sometimes.<br>
<br>
I'm not a big fan of how they dealt with Raise Ally in arena by giving it a 15 minute cooldown rather than just flagging it as unusable in arena. It really impacted the fun of the spell by the frequency it could be used in PvE. The 5 minute duration of the ghoul doesn't much make up for it because in most situations they don't live that long. Faction Champions in the only fight I can think of where someone I've ghoul'd has lived to the end of the fight (rather, they Corpse Exploded on the last champion left up).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>If you are running Kalorie's sim, remember that it underestimates the DPS of the 13-GCD Reaping/GoIT build at those settings. In practice, a properly designed 13-GCD Unholy rotations will only incur a time loss <i>the first time</i> it goes over 12 GCDs under the above conditions (standard Ulduar haste rating, 150 ms effective latency, and raid buffs). After that, the rotation will continue to run at no time loss. This effect was tested and confirmed to work when we had the 13-GCD Unholy rotation discussion way back.<br>
<br>
As far as I can tell, Kalorie's sim imposes the first-time loss on every rotation, not just the first. You can get a good idea of what the rotation can do if the sim could model the rotation properly by setting the latency below 25-30 ms. You need to be careful, though, because at that effective latency setting the sim will inflate the numbers for the "no-Reaping/no-Epidemic" spec/rotation you simulated beyond what it can actually do (14-GCD rotations won't compress to lossless under realistic conditions except when under Bloodlust).<br>
<br>
 - - -<br>
<br>
The spec I linked in my previous post has 1/2 Epidemic. I find that to be the best general option.<br>
<br>
In extended AE situations, the second point in Epidemic doesn't really do much for you. Running D&amp;D on a 15-sec cycle and PE on a 20-sec cycle for extended AE, you will run into collisions where both D&amp;D and PE needs to be refreshed on the same half rune set, and you will lose uptime on one or the other. The solution is to run PE on a 15-sec cycle (of alternating long-short refreshes with the long refresh being 16 to 17.5 sec and short being 30 to 31 sec minus the long depending on the rotation design). This does not require a second point in Epidemic.<br>
<br>
With the 1/2 Epidemic Reaping build you can switch to 4xSS with only RoR loss for 1 disease and 1 PS in situations where you have RP coming in from external sources. With 0/2 Epidemic Reaping/GoIT, you will lose 2 disease ticks if you go 4xSS, which incurs more than 3x the DPS loss of the 1/2 Epidemic build (of course, if you don't have Reaping, you don't have the option of getting a GCD back in those situations at all). While going 0/2 Epidemic is a small single-target DPS gain, personally I think the advantages of 1/2 Epidemic far outweighs that gain.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Clark, remember that Bone Shield grants a 2% damage buff while active, and while I don't know how much that would add up to on average, I'm fairly sure it's 2k or more over the course of a fight per minute. If you never used the Blood Tap to use it, you'd lose that or else lose damage keeping it up without the extra blood Tap rune (via destroying a SS cast).<br>
<br>
Granted if Bone shield ends very fast in a specific fight with lots of AoE, possibly the Blood Strike would be higher. But if that is the case, perhaps something could be said for the low maintenance you are in that kind of scenario.</div>

	</tbody></table>
</div>I do remember that Bone shield grants that 2% buff while active, but it does that on live with a 5 minute duration. It isn't as if I were losing that 2% buff to blood strike. I only use that rune to recast Bone shield once every 5 minutes.<br>
<br>
On live, I get that 2% damage buff but I use only 1 rune every 5 minutes, as a DPS with nothing beating on me.<br>
<br>
With a 1 minute duration, you have to spend 5 runes every 5 minutes. <br>
<br>
That is a net loss of 4 runes/5 minutes.<br>
<br>
The point is that people are mistaken saying dropping the duration to 1 minute is a DPS gain. It is definitely a DPS loss over Live.<br>
<br>
And please stop saying you would cast Bone shield with Blood tap every 1 minute on live to generate 20RP as if it were a good idea.  That Blood Tap death rune could be used to cast Blood Strike or any other single rune damage ability and Blood tap + 1 strike would still generate 20 RP for the exact same global cooldown.<br>
<br>
I can see how someone might think that lowering Bone shield cooldown is a net RP gain, but it isn't, because that U rune, or death rune that you used to cast Bone shield could just as easily be used to cast blood boil or Blood Strike for the same RP gain.<br>
<br>
Anyone who is recasting Bone shield 1/minute on live by using Blood tap is generating the exactly the same RP as casting Blood tap+Blood Strike 1/minute. You get 20RP per minute. I get 20RP +2k damage/ minute.<br>
<br>
TLDR VERSION: Blood TAP + Blood Strike &gt;&gt; Blood Tap + Bone shield. Nerfing the duration to 1 minute is  a DPS LOSS.<br>
<br>
again, if I am wrong, please tell me how. Aren't your Blood Strikes and Blood Boils macroed with Blood tap for that extra attack once a minute?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

So while yes it definitely is a dps nerf to Bone Shield, the new rotation will more than compensate for it (or at least that's what the last page or 2 of posts sugests) resulting in a net DPS increase over the old rotation.  Of course we won't know for sure untill the patch goes live as there might be more changes on the way.<br>

</div>No, his point is if Bone Shield were to stay up for a full 5 minutes, you could then use Blood Tap on another ability such as Blood Strike for 4 of those 5 minutes.  Instead you now have yo use blood tap for bone shield every time just to keep up bone shield for your 2% damage increase.<br>
<br>
Now, if your bone shield doesn't last 1 minute, then yes, the duration change doesn't affect you, but if it lasts 2 minutes or longer, Clark is correct in that this is a DPS loss.  Again, this is assuming you use Blood Tap for something other than bone shield, and that bone shield isn't knocked off in less than 1 minute due to Boss AoE.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1390808"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I think a lot of people are missing Clark's point.  He's not saying not to use bone shield in favor of blood strike, just once BS becomes 1 min, it has to be cast a lot more frequently, assuming no damage removes it, which requires runes to be spent.<br>
<br>
In a perfect scenario, Bone Shield will last the full 5 mins and only needs to be cast 1 time.<br>
<br>
When it goes to 1 min, it now has to be cast 5 times in that same 5 min time period.  <br>
<br>
Instead of casting bone shield those extra 4 times, you could use blood tap to get an extra Blood Strike 4 times.  Assuming you'd want to use the tap on the bone shield for the 2% boost, it's effectively a dps loss, because you have to use Bone Shield instead of Blood Strike.<br>
<br>
Now, whether it is better to use tap + bone shiled or tap + blood strike is something that requires a bit more thought, because you'd have to assume you get the full benefit of the bone shield.  If we're using Farno's numbers, then it's 8.4k damage a minute, so over 5 mins it would be 42k damage for tap + bone shield.  For tap + blood strike, it would be a 3.2k blood strike 5 times or 16k over the 5 mins, easily putting tap and bone shield in the lead.<br>
<br>
I'm pretty sure he's just trying to say that in live vs 3.2.2, there is a loss of rune usage that could be put to better use, not that he's comparing tap + shield to tap + blood strike once 3.2.2 hits.<br>

Exactly. And in PVE situations on LIVE, you almost always get the full 5 minute duration. I've never noticed losing charges to boss AOE.<br>
<br>
Edit: to confirm. I have 2 accounts. I set up my mage on the second account to blizzard my DK. Blizzard tics do not reduce bone shield. Arcane explosion does remove bone shield charges. Living Bomb does not remove Bone shield charges. Flame strike will remove 1 charge with the inital damage portion, but the dots do not remove charges.<br>
<br>
In PVE boss encounters this behavior is similar. Most boss AOE is environmental in the form of a DOT, and these do not remove charges. Occasional singe damage pulse aoe will remove charges.<br>
 iIRC, this behavior has been there since beta. Only direct damage attacks reduce bone shield charges.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>this discussion's gotten a little silly.  i think people have explained what clark's post meant quite thoroughly.  1 min duration on boneshield is primarily a wash, and probably a very small DPS loss compared to if it were 5 min.<br>
<br>
off the top of my head, there are really no talent points (that you wouldn't have taken anyway) that added to the 20rp and bloodstrike every minute are going to give you the DPS gain of boneshield, considering most talent points are &lt;= 1% dps.  not to mention the damage mitigation should you actually get hit.  we went over this discussion a month ago in the old thread.<br>
<br>
i think it's time to focus on epidemic and whether it's worth dropping.  furthermore, if maybe there's a helpful way to go about testing things on the PTR when it's up.  i do have confidence in the simulator but these discussions of latency settings, not to mention the whole GoDisease conversation, have certainly pointed out that it does indeed has its biases.<br>
<br>
edit:  haha, caught myself right as you posted.  i'm not going to argue with you, it's a loss.  it's just a loss of &gt; .5% dps, and more annoying than anything else.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>If you think the bone shield nerf is a wash then you did not understand my post. This discussion is not silly and it is NOT a wash. Losing 4 runes every 5 minutes is a loss. Assuming you use those 4 runes for 4 BS for 4k each average, then it is a 53 dps loss. It may be small, but we are here to optimize, no?<br>
<br>
Napkin math<br>
<br>
4 runes = 4 Blood Strike for 4k each =16000 damage every 5 minutes that you are losing refreshing Bone shield,<br>
<br>
16000/300 seconds =53.3333 dps lost.<br>
<br>
Addendum:<br>
<br>
Obviously I picked 4k as an arbitrary number for Blood Strike damage. On live, with my gear I am getting more like 2-3k. But the point remains. It is a significant DPS loss. We quibble here over 10 dps differences. Even if blood strike hits for 2k, it is a 26 dps loss.<br>
<br>
Addendum 2:<br>
<br>
I agree, it is damned annoying too. And losing the blood tap to cast bone shield is annoying as well. It was always there to save your rotation in case you flubbed something. And if you got the rotation right, it was a nice dps gain. This basically makes blood tap useless.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Fair enough. I am frustrated because it is such a pointless change. Unholy did not need a dps nerf, even a minor one. And it is a really annoying change from a quality of life perspective. It isn't as if Unholy dk's need more buttons to push.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Edit:<br>
<br>
I more thing. There are some otherwise good theorycrafters who are mistakenly advocating using bone shield and Blood Tap every cooldown on live 3.2 to generate RP. This is really suboptimal for reasons amply stated before. Some folks who don't know any better come here and take everything written here as gospel. That is one of the reasons I have been belaboring this point. <br>

		<div id="post_message_1391043"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Clark is right. Most people - and I'll be honest, I'm one of them - don't remember to use BT + BStrike due to plain forgetfulness/saving it in case BShield falls off early/messing up one's rotation if used improperly. That doesn't mean it's not optimal, to use on cooldown, however - because it is. ERW is another one people often forget or use suboptimally, but whatever.<br>

Scales with stats much better than the previous build with epidemic and that build scaled better than its predecessor did with both epidemic and reaping. ArP is actually so-so, and not plain bad. Haste is pretty decent. Crit is strong (thanks to 4p t9, not really anything spec specific). So, yeah. The BiS lists won't change as much as they would have originally.<br>
<br>
To some other various points: Even if you don't actually use DnD every 15 seconds, no matter how quick you are after toggling it to target a spot on the ground and cast it, it does take time. Even if right now it's only casted every 20 seconds, if it had a 20 second CD, it would be casted less than that - maybe just a second or two later, but still. What more, you have to remember that despite rune refreshes being 10 seconds after the initial go around they will be refreshing quicker than that (by how much depends on latency/how many gcds you actually used previously/etc) due to previously discussed "grace" mechanics. Thus, yeah, taking a point out of Morbidity is definitely a loss in DnD uptime, even in the most perfect of scenarios. I can present it as an option but, honestly, I would never do it myself. The single target gain is negligible - hardly noticeable at all and, in reality, it's probably a single target loss (as you will always do more DCs in game then the sim does, due to revitalize/AMS). The AoE loss, although not staggering, is pretty modestly sized when you consider how potent DnD is. <br>
<br>
Also, your live conditions thing is completely faulty since the sim - even the older version of it - assumed 4pt9 worked. It obviously doesn't at the moment. That's going to cause it to overvalue Bladed Armor and particularly Dark Conviction by way more than they actually are, at the moment. <br>
<br>
As to no-epidemic+IT-glyph being less valuable if you already get a ton of RP from AMS/Revitalize - that isn't the case. With such a build/glyph, DC is actually your single highest damage move. As such, you can freely dump RP if you're capped, even if you have runes waiting. It will be a net dps gain. The only case in which it wouldn't is if your disease were to fall but, with a 15 second duration and with them being applied every ~10 seconds, you have plenty of time.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1391124"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->5rp per 5 seconds is a better way to artificially undo the dirge nerf. 10rp per 10 seconds is slightly worse, and slightly less accurate, for fairly self-obvious reasons.<br>
<br>
Anyways, using the default 2h Ulduar gear set (which I still dislike for a variety of reasons, but that's neither here nor there) I got 7210 dps for 0/17/54 Oblit (with said 5 rp per 5 seconds to cover Dirge) and then 7242 dps for 17/0/54 SS/Epidemicless. That's a 32 dps difference. However, you then have to factor in Subversion manually, as you say. SS having 9% less crit will mean you will do approximately 6% less damage with SS (57% crit rate would go down to 48%). SS did 8.4% of the sim's overall damage. Thus, 7242 x 0.084 x 0.06 = 36.49968. So, 17/0/54 comes out behind, and that's ignoring the AoE aspect and such.<br>
<br>
If one wishes to respec just to get a hang of what playing in 3.2.2 will be like, or because they're already dropping ArP in preparation (not that you will need to drop as much as previously though, as discussed in previously posted stat weights), then that's cool, of course. The difference is minute. But it is a negative difference all the same.<br>

		<div id="post_message_1391170"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Yeah, I was considering the reasoning behind why it would show that. I am fairly positive it has to do with the GCD clipping aspect of it. <br>
<br>
With 17/0/54 and no Epidemic, you are typically using 15 GCDs per 2 rune refreshes (~20 seconds) which is obviously putting you over 20 seconds (and this is ignoring anything from AMS/Revitalize). The fact that you go over 20 seconds doesn't matter from a disease cut-off point of view, due to diseases being refreshed every 10 seconds, but what does matter is the fact that the lower GCD means you can condense those 15 GCDs from the base 22.5 seconds it would take, and each fraction of a GCD haste cuts off is a direct dps increase as you will already be sitting on the resource for your next ability, so if you can do the next ability that much sooner, it's a win. This isn't the case now since we run with free GCDs and have to typically wait for our next resource. When you are, in part, GCD limited, however, lowering that GCD becomes quite good. <br>
<br>
It's hard to compare to another class as other melees don't actually benefit from the spell GCD reduction (7 out of the 15 GCDs we'll be using are spells, btw).<br>
<br>
This, on top of the already decent value the stat has thanks to Necrosis and the Ghoul, makes it seem logical to me.<br>
<br>
It's also the same reason why 0/17/54 currently values haste more than 3/13/55, simply to a larger extent.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1391263"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The thing you have to remember is that as 17/0/54, we will not be rune constrained. If runes refreshed in 9 seconds instead of 10, it would actually make no difference for us. If they refreshed in 11 seconds, it wouldn't make a difference.  Not with the GCD the way it is.<br>
<br>
(If they refreshed in longer than 11 seconds we would then have empty gcds so haste would lose value. If they refreshed in less than 9 seconds, another spec would win out anyways, so this would become moot). <br>
<br>
Since runes are not a limitation - they already refresh as fast as we could want - the comparison to Paladin doesnt quite work out. If they get haste, yeah, they can use more abilities more often. However, they cannot use all of their abilities equally more often (if that makes sense) due to the individual cooldowns. With us, however, we can - 5% haste would increase how often we end up using all of our active abilities against a single target by X% (X% being 5% times the fraction of our total gcds which are from spells, essentially) equally. If you ignore RP from AMS/Revitalize, anyways.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure if I'm quite making any sense or getting across the point I'm trying to get across. Think of it this way - with a paladin, they are more cooldown limited than gcd limited. Haste doesn't allow them to use their hardest hitting abilities any more often because of those very cooldowns. Us, on the other hand, are not cooldown limited (if you consider runes our cooldowns, which they kinda are). Our hardest hitting active ability - DC + UB - will be able to be used more often if we are able to do everything else more often (and all of that stuff we do more often will help as well).<br>

I did the sims with 3-13-55 OB (7181 dps) and not 0-17-54 OB (7210 dps). The difference is bigger then to 17-0-54. (7247 dps - 0,5%(Subversion) = 7211 dps).<br>
<br>
And i don´t really buy your argument about the AoE loss. WP has more chances to proc. Don´t forget that you have 5% more crit. Only two more procs in 20 seconds (which is possible with 5% more crit) would close your AoE-gap.<br>
<br>
Anyway, i just wanted to point out, that you could change specs right now, if you want to get back to SS as soon as possible. My own gear has far more haste, for me changing right now is pure win.<br>

How would you change that rotation with D&amp;D on 15 Seconds-CD? You would destroy the entire rotation. You could not target D&amp;D before the necessary runes come off CD. So the point about the delay does not really fit. <br>
<br>
You won´t win anything really with the shorter CD on D&amp;D. With 15 Second CD on D&amp;D you could D&amp;D in second 23 instead of 24,5. Winning only 1,5 seconds, but delaying and destroying your further rotation.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

_________________________________<br>
<br>
IUP is not a dps boost. Using UP automatically brings your GCD to one, which kills half the (presumed) reason haste is so relatiavely valuable now. What more is the fact that although 17/0/54 uses more GCDs than can fit in Blood normally, it doesn't use enough for Unholy - in Unholy Presence, you would have empty ones, which kinda kills it. I tried various sims with UP/IUP and couldn't get it to be a boost, and there's really no reason it should.<br>
_________________________________<br>
<br>
As I said, the difference is very slight either way with the current specs. The reason I used 0/17/54 in my comparison is simply because it was the first option from the drop down menu and because at the gear level of the 2H ulduar set, it would indeed be superior, and if the idea was to see if switching now was a dps gain, that's the comparison one would want to make. As I said, there's nothing wrong with switching specs now, and it is indeed quite viable, but it's not a dps boost (well, with your numbers, I guess it's a boost of 1, but a margin that small is just going to be covered up by RNG one way or the other).<br>
<br>
The WP gain wouldn't be enough to undo the already discussed Blood Boil loss. Not quite. Does narrow the gap though.<br>
<br>
You can DnD in your chart at 19 seconds. And then at 34 (you can simply apply/spread diseases afterwards, and they won't have dropped), etc, etc. So on and so forth. You can certainly make use of that extra 5 seconds off, so I am not quite understanding what you are getting at. You can DnD every 15 seconds without running in to the problem of it coninciding with diseases needing to be applied/spread - because you have a 5 seconds window in which to apply diseases after when you normally would have (since diseases have the 15s duration yet are normally applied every 10 seconds). Hence if you used DnD at 34 because you had previously used it at 19, you would then PS/IT/Pest on 35.5/37/38.5 (your last pest was at 23 seconds, meaning that diseases fall off at 38. So long as you have even the slightest bit of haste on your gear, plus the haste you get from raid buffs, it will make that cut off. Even if it were not to, you could just delay using that pest at 23 until 24, as it would have made no actual dps difference since your DnD doesn't come off cooldown until 34 anyways).<br>
<br>
So, yeah, Morbidity = you can use DnD five seconds sooner then you otherwise would, giving you a 33% increase in DnD damage over an infinite period of time (10/15 seconds over 10 / 20 seconds = 1.33). In reality, it's obviously not that large of a gain since fights are not of infinite length, but to say that third point is meaningless is quite incorrect. You do get something out of it: exactly what it says, the ability to use DnD five seconds more often (something which is completely doable without losing dps, so long as you actively think about your rotation). <br>
<br>
With Epidemic, yes, making full use of that last point of DnD becomes difficulty because you don't you have little leeway as to win you refresh your diseases normally and when you would if it gets pushed off. Without Epidemic, you don't have that problem since you have a 5 seconds - 3 gcds, the perfect number - window each and every time.<br>
_________________________________<br>
<br>
I tried using a PS + IT build, but couldn't quite get it to work. The reason why being disease clipping (which will be a bigger loss than ever with 4p t9), Sigil of Virulence (you would lose its proc in such a spec), and gcd limitations (you can switch to UP, yes, but then that entails its own tradeoffs). I did not try PS + IT with DRM, but that's pretty much going into the old IT x6 rotations of Frost, practically. Although it may be viable, it would almost certainly be better to do it DWing, since the only abilities being affected by weapon damage would be BS/PS.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>That´s wrong sorry. If you D&amp;D at second 19.5, this runes used will be available at second 27.5. Doing nothing from 23 on... wait 4.5 seconds for the runes to come back (2-second-window). Then let´s do a SS and BB. This runes will be again available at 37.5... to start your diseases again (Just did a D&amp;D at 34.5). 37.5/39/40.5. You lose disease uptime on every target for 2.5 seconds. Second 38 to 40.5. If you are the only UH-DK not really an Option. <br>
<br>
If you want to use D&amp;D in 15 second-intervalls without Epidemic, you are not really able to use BB. <br>

		<div id="post_message_1391642"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Another thing to keep in mind is the fact that if GCD availability is the primary benefit of haste for Unholy in 3.2.2, it'd be good to determine the exact point where it no longer provides needed GCDs and what it's EP would be after that point.<br>
<br>
Basically we have 22.5 seconds currently worth of spells in the Reaping-less rotation, so the question is, considering not all of the abilities we'll be using are spells, how much haste would it take to chop 2 GCDs off the rotation?<br>
<br>
8 of those GCDs are melee attacks, and 7 are spells.<br>
<br>
So we need to chop probably about 2 GCDs off to make room for latency/user reaction speed.<br>
<br>
So we'd want, what, about 29-30% haste then, optimally, no more?<br>
<br>
Edit:Actually, I'm only coming up with 12-13 GCDs per rotation, not 15, what am I missing?<br>
<br>
IT PS BS BS SS DC (1 second gap) SS BS BS SS DC DC is 12 GCDs+1 second, 13 GCDs when RP overflow allows a second DC during the first runeset in the 1 second gap.  That's 19.5 seconds, just barely within the 20 sec rotation.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
In the case you're talking about, you can instead spread diseases at 34.5 and DnD at 37.5 (which is 18 seconds from your previous one. Still a gain over 20 seconds. If you wanted to keep going, it would essentially fall like that - 15 seconds between DnD and DnD, then 18 seconds, then 15 seconds, etc). Although perhaps not the full gain, it is most certainly a gain. It just doesn't make a for a "clean" rotation. Priority system ftw?<br>
<br>
Also, beside the point, but you should SS before BBing. SoV proccing and all.<br>
_________________<br>
<br>
I was trying to figure that out earlier. With 15 GCDs, you're at 22.5 seconds. You could bring that down to as little as 19 seconds (7 spell gcds, minus 0.5s each). Optimally, you would bring it down to 20 seconds.<br>
<br>
However, if you bring it down to 19, you have an extra second (which is an entire spell gcd at that point), which would allow you the perfect place for Ams/Revitalize -&gt; DC dropping. So, yeah, going all the way to the spell gcd cap should be fine. I doubt you'll get all the way there in BiS, but it does mean you shouldn't worry about getting too much of the stat. There just isn't that much of it on good gear and, unlike hit and the like, it isn't worth going out of your way to cap or anything like that.<br>
<br>
You have the rotation wrong, which is part of where you are missing GCDs. Remember, no epidemic and no reaping. Thus:<br>
PS IT SS BS BS DC Horn DC // PS IT SS BS BS DC DC = 15 GCDs and not a single RP remaining.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

PS-IT-SS-BS-BS-DC-DC every 10 seconds. (gaining 79 RP every 10 seconds without HoW)<br>
<br>
You have to use IT and 2x DC in 4 sec. Therefore needing a GCD of 1,33 sec with no Latency.<br>
<br>
1.50 / 1.33 = 1.1278  You need would need about 13% Haste without Latency.<br>
<br>
Factoring in Latency (150ms) - Seven abilities - 1050ms - Let´s say one additional second.<br>
<br>
So you have to use IT and 2x DC in 3sec. (4GCD for melees = 6 secs, 1 sec Latency, 3 sec remaining)<br>
<br>
You need an GCD of 1sec to do this. Therefore needing 1.5/ 1 = 1.5 -&gt; 50% Haste<br>
<br>
I don´t think, that you will ever reach that number as Consider mentioned.<br>
<br>
@ Consider<br>
<br>
You forgot the the RP gain from Butchery. I think that HoW will be a dps loss (One HoW every 100 sec would be enough). But i am not sure. <br>
<br>
As a BloodElf you could even produce 15 RP every 2 Minutes without ever using HoW and therefore you won´t lose that GCD.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Because it does less damage than the alternative? =p. That's really all there is to it. You spend 10 points to get 15% IT damage, 10% Frost damage, and 10% shadow damage. Alternatively you can spend those points in Blood and get 9% SS crit, 9% BS crit, 2 RP/5 seconds, 4% weapon damage, and however much AP 3 points of Bladed Armor gives. The latter simply wins out. Scourge Strike and DC aren't as large a portion of dps as they were in 3.1 (especially when you factor in no reaping and no epidemic rotations), and thus Black Ice doesn't scale as well.<br>

</div>Well, doing things the old fashioned way:<br>
Greatness = 90 STR passive + 300 STR proc x 33% uptime<br>
Greatness = 90 (3.05) + 100 (3.05)<br>
Greatness = 579.5 AP<br>
<br>
Comet's Trail = 240 AP passive + 726 Haste proc x 20% uptime<br>
Comet's Trail = 240 (1) + 145.2 (2.29)<br>
Comet's Trail = 240 + 332.5<br>
Comet's Trail = 572.508<br>
<br>
Doesn't quite win out, although due to the fact that the gap is so incredibly small, depending on how Zerack's calculates the uptimes, the latter could be slightly on top. But then you have to remember is that if all of that haste (which is quite a chunk) plus your haste on gear plus haste from a ret paladin/moonkin/etc is enough to put your gcd where it needs to be, with that point depending on your latency and such although Bensch showed the estimate abopve, it will begin to lose value.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1392108"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->IF my math is right, then it would take ~1378 haste (42%) with Wrath of Air and Boomkin/Ret aura to reach the GCD cap for our spells in blood presence.  I don't see this even being remotely feasible really.<br>
<br>
That said though, getting to 1.33 GCD would require 410 haste, or only 148ish with Boomkin/Ret aura.  1.25 requires 656 or 394. Finally, 1.16 would be 937 or 675 haste.<br>

1.25 (technically 1.28) would safely allow another spell to be cast assuming 6 in the regular rotation (or just shorten the rotation by 1.5 seconds), so haste is certainly looking good.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1392208"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Thanks to the people who clarified where the extra RP comes from, shame on me for not catching that.<br>
<br>
Now as far as rotation can anyone confirm if this would be the optimal cycle<br>
<br>
(Horn at start)  <b>PS - IT - SS - BS - BS - DC - DC</b> x5<br>
                          <b>PS - IT - SS - BS - BS - BT - Bone Shield - BT cancel - DC - DC</b><br>
<br>
<b>Repeat</b><br>
<br>
Since Bone Shield more than supplies the extra 10RP needed every 100s you won't ever need to pause to reapply Horn (especialy if someone else is doing it or you have shammy totem)<br>
<br>
In which case the only question is what's the best place in the rotation to break for Gargoyle and use ERW. I'm guessing right after the second BS pop Garg then burn ERW then restart the rotation from the begining.<br>

</div>Threat issues aside, throwing up IT as you run in is almost certainly the way to go post-patch, and likely on live as well.  Doing so effectively buys you one extra GCD, and it is hard to think of a way to spend that GCD that will do less damage than 10% on the IT and 5 ticks of Frost Fever.  Given the way runes come off cooldown, it is very easy to switch back to PS first.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1392840"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Personally, I start with IT on ranged pulls, then as Diospadre says, switch back to PS first once I'm stationary, as that tends to be optimal, and hence why that's how it's handled in the OP. One GCD &gt; 10% IT damage, however once you're still you lose that extra GCD from IT first, so 10% IT &gt; nothing. In a perfect rotation with no extra RP from AMS/Revitalize/Etc and no lag, it wouldn't matter, as you would always be reusing both before FF/BP fell off, but yeah - that might be how it is on paper, but in reality it isn't.<br>
<br>
Also have to remember that on half the fights in TotC you can start in melee range, due to how the boss encounters start, so it becomes a simple decision.<br>
<br>
________________________________<br>
<br>
<br>
So, since it was brought up by Bensch, I've been doing some more live testing of 17/0/54 in comparison to 0/17/54 Oblit and 3/13/55 Oblit - running a lot of sims and doing some good old paper math. <br>
<br>
Apparently I was quite wrong (as I'll be the first to admit) in being so quick to discard the possibility on live since it's seemingly more than just a possibility.<br>
<br>
Using my own gear (minus the 4p t9 bonus, which I set as not having, as it essentially does nothing currently) instead of the default 2h Uld set used in the previous tests by myself/Bensch (this is the key point, as when I/Bensch used the 2h Uld set it was shown to be a neutral dps change or, at the most, a single digit difference from live. That gear set, however, is rather weak compared to what most people have, and I myself am nowhere near BiS or anything amazing), I am getting a much larger gap between the two - over 100 dps (~7515 average for 17/0/54 as opposed to ~7400 for 0/17/54)*. Factoring out the Subversion change since it's obviously not live (Dirge was covered for 0/17/54 by adding 5 RP per 5 seconds), the first still comes out a solid 50-75 dps ahead. What more is that when I changed the tests to using the X fights of 350s length, the dps gap went up to ~170 dps, which would put it ~125-150 dps ahead.<br>
<br>
Without some actual parses/more sims of other people, I wouldn't (yet) go so far as to call it optimal and definitely worth speccing in to - but it is pretty interesting stuff and enough (for me, anyways) to switch and see how it performs in an actual raid. So long as your gear is superior to the 2h Ulduar set in the sim (which it probably is for most raiders, as that set is fairly 'bleh' at this point), it has a lot of potential. <br>
<br>
As such, I went ahead and added 17/0/54 to the "live server" part of the OP. Currently it's just in the specs, but I'll also add in the stat weights/rotation/glyphs/etc to all of those areas. Simple enough to do since I merely have to drag the text down from the Changes section and then slightly edit it as appropriate. I'll do it in the morning, assuming I don't forget.<br>
<br>
*Live spec aside, these numbers also show that going forward, we'll scale better with the new 17/0/54 build than we would have with either of the Oblit builds, which is always a plus.<br>
<br>
After playing with it for a bit, I will say this though; the spec certainly does take some getting used to - refreshing diseases when they have 5+ seconds left, and not having a single empty gcd (even with only HoWing every 100 seconds) is quite odd feeling.<br>
<br>
I think the best part about all of this is that, assuming it is true and that 17/0/54 is currently a dps wash at worse or a dps gain more likely, that means a SS build (and thus SS) has been viable this entire time. And apparently no one - GC and the devs included - caught the possibility of it until these patch notes. So we never had to touch Obliterate, they never had to buff Subversion or nerf Dirge (although both of those changes are good for the long run, regardless). The list goes on. Very, very amusing. Haha.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">After playing with it for a bit, I will say this though; the spec certainly does take some getting used to - refreshing diseases when they have 5+ seconds left<br>
<br>
And apparently no one - GC and the devs included - caught the possibility of it until these patch notes. So we never had to touch Obliterate, they never had to buff Subversion or nerf Dirge (although both of those changes are good for the long run, regardless). The list goes on. Very, very amusing. Haha.</div>

</div>I thought Unholy used a priority system of refreshing diseases when they are about fall off, so the 3.2+ SS build instead uses a rotation where you clip diseases?<br>
<br>
Edit:  Due to a 15 second diseases in the SS build, you have to refresh diseases earlier.<br>
<br>
EJ has a large influence, people copy/paste stuff here in other places.  Whatever is posted here is usually taken as gospel, even if it is isn't totally accurate.  While the Oblit build may have been unnecessary, I like that Subversion was buffed because of it, since it encourages people to go to the Blood tree which rewards people wearing Plate via Bladed Armor (I like if Plate is always better than the same item level Leather/Mail).<br>

</div>We did many sims with or without reaping, with or without epidemic, with or without SS and this new 17-0-54 showed up as the winner. Even now on live-servers. <br>
<br>
You don´t actually lose any disease-ticks. In a 20-second-rotation the diseases tick 6 times (3,6,9,12,15,18). In the 10-second rotation now they tick 3 times. Making a total of 6 ticks in 20 seconds as before. (3,6,9,13,16,19). Because of this clipping is no problem.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
You actually do lose some disease ticks (which is why 4p t9, although still incredible, has a lower EP value in the stat weights), or at least the simulator believes you do - and I'm inclined to believe. A better way to think of it is not how many disease ticks you have but how many you lose - in a 20 second rotation, you apply them once, losing somewhere between 0-3 seconds of diseases ticking (even if they wouldn't have ticked during that time). In a 10 second rotation you apply them once, losing between 0-3 seconds of diseases ticking, thus it happening twice as often, meaning you're losing more time. The reason why simply looking at the number of ticks doesn't work is because where Oblit builds do have a clean 20 second rotation, SS does not - it's over 10 seconds (which makes it over 20), as previously discussed in terms of haste.<br>
<br>
Anyways, some pic proof:<br>

(The reason the numbers in these two are both about 50 dps higher than the ones I previous offered was because draenei aura was turned on. They both gained almost the exact same dps from it, so it wouldn't have changed anything in my previous post)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1393135"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I did some simulations and on-site testing using 0/17/54 (Obli UH) and 17/0/54 (SS UH). I couldn't really be bothered to get any raid buffs so I just went into the live test by whacking at target-dummy selfbuffed. In order to reduce the random element I stopped meters at few points, run them again and made sure I used gargoyle exactly as many times in both specs. Results on sims and live are:<br>
<br>
Simulated DPS, "Ulduar Set" 0/17/54: 6984<br>
Simulated DPS, "Ulduar Set" 17/0/54: 7025<br>
Difference ~40 dps<br>
<br>
Simulated DPS, "My currect gear" 0/17/54: 7021<br>
Simulated DPS, "My current gear" 17/0/54: 7063<br>
Difference ~40 dps<br>
<br>
Live testing DPS, no raid buffs, "My currect gear" 0/17/54: 3633<br>
Live testing DPS, no raid buffs, "My currect gear" 17/0/54: 3762<br>
Difference ~130 dps<br>
<br>
So yeah, as surprising as it seems Scourge Strike spec look viable even at current live realm as long as you use the PS - IT - SS - BS - BS - DC - DC rotation.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
PS - IT - SS - BS - BS - BT/Bone Shield - DC - DC -- Here, the rune you use for PS comes off cooldown before you can cast Bone Shield, so it gets consumed instead of the death rune.  Then, the unholy rune you used for SS comes off cooldown before you can cast SS, still leaving you with that death rune.  This results in a very odd set of runes that gets pretty confusing.<br>
<br>
Note that this rotation works just fine on the very first set of runes you use, but subsequent cycles will produce the cooldowns that screw everything up.<br>
<br>
PS - IT - SS - BS - BT/Bone Shield -BS - BT/Bone Shield - DC - DC -- This uses blood rune 1, then turns blood rune 2 into a death rune, allowing you to use Bone Shield before your unholy runes come off cooldown, avoiding the problems in the above set.  However, this causes you to lose a blood strike.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Is how I handled it. All it does is cause you to lose a gcd (which is no different than any other spec), but it doesn't mess up your rotation in the long term - I wasn't having the rune for PS come off cooldown before BT/BShield, even beyond the first, although it is admittedly a very small window. You have about 0.5 seconds (depending on your haste/latency/etc), which is plenty of time for an instant cast.<br>
<br>
That said, there is a potential solution if you have that problem for lag or whatever reason: Simply switch IT and PS, as previously discussed. With neither disease ever falling, even with a ton of RP from AMS/Revitalize, it would make zero difference in this spec.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Just another question. I´m actually simming the new unholy DW-Topdog. But where should i post my results?<br>

Both threads or only the DW one?<br>

I´ll just give a hint. The new unholy-rotation will actually be the best one for DW Unholy. On live and when 3.2.2 hits respectively.<br>
<br>
3-13-55 (don´t having 4PCT9)  / 15-0-55 +1 (only with 4PCT9) - whenever you break 4PCT9 3-13-55 will again become better.<br>

		<div id="post_message_1393471"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I've yet to play with the sumulator since I do most of my reading/theroycrafting at work so I'm curiuos about some actual figures here.<br>
<br>
I have 1 complete rotation clock at 10.5s on paper (latency not accounted for, 0 haste)<br>
now to add latency, say 200ms which seems to be average for me I have .02x7 = 1.4 s <br>
so total is just shy of 12s<br>
<br>
Now for the Rune CD grace period. I was under the impression that the way it works is <br>
<b>Full Rune CD (10s) - Time off CD</b> and for this rotation the you wont have anything off CD for more than .5s + latency so then runes should CD at around 9s?<br>
The reason why I'm asking is because I'm trying to understand how Unholy rune might overlap with BT/Boneshield as I'm seeing them at 2s apart (that's with PS before IT)<br>
<br>
I'm still curious about the optimal Gargoyle use as well, since using Garg instead of DC1 and EWR instead of DC2 seems like a waste of EWR, you might as well wait for the next rune to come off CD (maybe throw in a Horn) and continue with your regular rotation. In which case EWR just doesnt provide any added benefit in terms of burst DPS as the rotation is already completely full and would be saved for a serious messup or AoE.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

This would proc Desolation, possibly 2pt9, and also has a decent chance of proccing trinkets and/or FC meaning that your diseases would hit harder for that rotation in addition to the extra (1 or 2) SS...all you lose is the disease damage scaling from the first BS.<br>
<br>
Additionally you could use Blood Tap immediately after using that first BS meaning that your two Blood runes are now Death runes for an additional SS in the first rotation, making your opener:<br>
<br>
BS BT PS IT SS SS DC HoW DC<br>
<br>
then return to standard PS IT SS BS BS DC HoW DC<br>
<br>
This would only be effective on the first rotation as you need to use Blood Tap after this for keeping up BS from that point on.  Thoughts?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The new Unholy build does not get Reaping, so no death rune from BS.<br>
You could try it, since you refresh diseases with this build pretty often, it doesn't seem worth doing.  <br>
<br>
Note on a random thought, if you didn't have the T9 sigil you could do a PS IT BS BS SS DC DC rotation instead for more dps (due to no sigil strength proc and 2x BS doing more damage than SS).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Gargoyle can be used the same as ever, replacing a DC. You seem to make some connection between when you use Garg and when you use ERW - there really isn't any. ERW (not EWR =p) is certainly tricky to use, however. The best time is probably after your second Death Coil, at which point you should Scourge Strike (twice, if you can, although the runes might only be up for it once), pop ERW, Death Coil, and then continue with the beginning of your rotation (PS - IT - etc, etc, etc). That would be a slight bump in burst dps - gaining an SS and DC in the time during which you would have just been doing PS/IT, although that PS/IT is pushed back, not replaced - and one which wouldn't mess with your rotation long term. Still, it's negligible, and best off saving for a serious messup/AoE, imo.<br>

</div>It depends on which pieces you are swapping out for, and whether they are 232, 245, or 258. Simply multiply out the EP values to figure it out - or just plug the stat weights into wowhead for it to automatically generate the scores for you.<br>

				I have tried out the 17/0/54 build on live a little bit and I noticed that there are times when you can use an extra SS or 2 BS's in your rotation without your diseases falling off. Is this still a dps loss to just refreshing PS-IT immediately after you RP dump?

</div>It's not worth doing. PS + IT comes very close to the damage of SS (within like 200ish), except for that fact that those two abilities generate twice the runic power. Now you might be thinking "Why don't we just skip SS altogether then", but you don't want to do that for three reasons: 1) GCD constraints, 2) Sigil of Virulence (how they plan to top SoV in Icecrown is a mystery to me. It's just so incredibly strong), and 3) Increased Disease Clipping.<br>
<br>
As to extra BS's, there should never be an opportunity where you can BS twice before diseases fall <i>as well as</i> do your two DCs before diseases fall. And DCing without diseases hurts. Bad. Not to mention you might end up losing more disease damage do the time the mob would sit without them then you would just clipping them early.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1394025"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I did some simple math but I might be wrong ofc. Used the values from OP.<br>
<br>
Since I have 2pct8 bonus atm which is 118.64 EP and I was considering swapping T8,5 head for t9 ilvl 245 head.<br>
Using wowhead and values from OP the stat differences are:<br>
<br>
26str * 3,05 - 79,3<br>
11crit * 2,1 - 23,1<br>
74exp * 1,65 - 122,1  (this wont cap my expertise)<br>
<br>
-49ArP * 1,30 - -63,7<br>
<br>
total: 160,8 EP<br>
(there is also the gain of 101 armor but I didn't include that since I'm not entirely sure how the mechanic works. Is it 5 AP per 180armor and next 5 AP when you reach that next 180 or does it also work without the 'full chunks'. example: 100 armor = 2,777.. AP ?)<br>
<br>
which is a gain of 42,16 EP from losing tier8 bonus and gaining a new shiny helmet with awesome stats.<br>
<br>
Is this right? I know that EP depends on my current gear etc but roughly it should be a gain rather than lose in DPS?<br>
<br>
Also since 4pct9 is based on melee crit does the agi/3% inc dmg meta gem beats crit rating/3% meta gem or is there still any value considering IT, DC, BB and DND? I guess the difference is minor.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1394119"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The thing you have to remember is that as long as you can get a 4 str (or stronger) socket bonus from using a <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100305012024/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=40146" target="_blank">[Fierce Ametrine]</a>, you will want to use that <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100305012024/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=40146" target="_blank">[Fierce Ametrine]</a> over a <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100305012024/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=40111" target="_blank">[Bold Cardinal Ruby]</a> regardless of meta-requirements, thus you make a mere 1.5 AP sacrifice to use Relentless (if you are using <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100305012024/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=49110" target="_blank">[Nightmare Tear]</a> to get a 6 str bonus, as 6 str + 10 agility is 1.5 AP behind just 10 str) as opposed to not having to worry about meta requirements. <br>
<br>
On the other hand, if you are using Chaotic, you have to use that <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100305012024/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=49110" target="_blank">[Nightmare Tear]</a> (which with a 6 str bonus is a 1.5 AP loss over a raw str gem, as already shown), and then a blue gem (which with a 6 str bonus is a 4 str - or 12.2 AP loss) - thus you lose a total of 13.7 AP. That's a difference of 12.2 AP. <br>
<br>
The difference between Relentless and Chaotic, pre-working-4p t9 is 13.23, meaning that you would gain 1.03 AP (13.23-12.2) with the latter.<br>
<br>
However, that requires you to have at least two separate pieces of gear, each of which have exactly one blue socket (and then zero yellow sockets - unless you aren't hit capped, in which case yellow sockets are fine - and any number of red sockets), and each of which give socket bonuses of 6 strength (or greater).<br>
<br>
So, yeah. I was a bit hasty, I suppose. It does depend on your gear. If you meet that rather specific gear criteria - which I personally don't, but it is certainly possible to do so - then Chaotic wins out. By 1 AP =p. The gap does grow greater next patch (with 4p t9 working) but not terribly so.<br>
<br>
I have contemplated adding a gem section to the OP (one of much more depth and clarity than this post, of course), especially with the value of haste going up so much, meaning that you'll actually want to use yellow sockets on Fierce Ametrines fairly often, instead of just skipping them over for reds. I might still do it, it's just that the meta-situation is <i>so</i> gear specific, that it's a pain to explain and to cover every scenario.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Using too many GCDs isn't quite the same as being GCD constrained, if that makes sense. DC + UB is our hardest hitting ability, meaning it's what you want to do the most of - you are better off DCing over using runes so long as diseases are up and you're RP capped (or the next ability will overcap you or you are on an empty gcd anyways). This is contrary to how it usually is in two ways:<br>
1) Rune abilities have usually hit harder for most specs, or<br>
2) We haven't had that many extra non-rune-gcds before we had to use runes to refresh diseases, which this spec, despite not having epidemic, has. You have a 5 second gap after runes refresh in which diseases are still on the mob. With epidemic and a 20 second rotation, you only have a 4 second gap after every other rune refresh. That means it's less than half as much.<br>
<br>
Thus when you ignore that factor - since it isn't a factor - it comes down to 1 IT + 1 PS or 1 SS. The latter might hit 100-200 harder, but the former generates almost twice the RP (35 as opposed to 20), which more than covers that gap, thus making it win.<br>
<br>
As said in a previous post, however, you can't drop SS completely because of SoV (which really is that huge), disease clipping (which you want as little as possible of) and because of GCDs (going over 10 seconds in gcds per rune refresh is fine, but going over 15 per rune refresh would cause issues, and dropping SS completely could lead to that potentially).<br>

</div>Not really. When you clip diseases in relation to the entire duration of the disease doesn't matter. What does matter is when you clip diseases in relation to how long the diseases had until it was to tick next. <br>
<br>
That said, using IT + PS more does increase the latter, which is why our total disease damage will be somewhat lower next patch. However, it is still worth doing:<br>
<br>
If you do what you're suggesting (which is PS - IT - SS - BS - BS - DC - DC // SS - IT - PS - BS - BS - DC - DC), what do you do on the third rune refresh? SS - PS - IT - BS - BS - DC - DC? Then you only notice that extra SS the first time around, as you can't keep doing it (since those BS's won't convert to death runes meaning you can't go SS - SS - PS - IT - DC - DC. And you don't want to go SS - SS - BS - BS - DC - DC, because diseases will fall off before that last DC). So, yeah, it isn't something you can do repeatedly, and thus disease clipping isn't an extended issue. You can do it once per the entire fight (or per phase change or whatever it would take for you to completely restart your rotation) and that's it. And the 20 extra RP covers that one time 100-200 damage loss - thus meaning you don't even want to bother doing it that one time.<br>
<br>
If any of that made sense.<br>
<br>
Feel free to use the sim and try to make it work, but I couldn't get it to myself, and these are the reasons why it seems logical to me that I couldn't.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I have contemplated adding a gem section to the OP (one of much more depth and clarity than this post, of course), especially with the value of haste going up so much, meaning that you'll actually want to use yellow sockets on Fierce Ametrines fairly often, instead of just skipping them over for reds. I might still do it, it's just that the meta-situation is <i>so</i> gear specific, that it's a pain to explain and to cover every scenario.</div>

</div>I never thought about that but seeing it made me do some math again just to see the values:<br>
<br>
20str - 20 * 3,05 = 61<br>
<br>
socket bonus 8 str - 8*3,05 = 24,4<br>
10str = 10*3,05 = 30,5<br>
10hst = 10 * 2,29 = 22,9<br>
total = 77,8<br>
<br>
socket bonus 6 str - 8*3,05 = 18,3<br>
10str = 10*3,05 = 30,5<br>
10hst = 10 * 2,29 = 22,9<br>
total = 71,1<br>
<br>
socket bonus 4 str - 8*3,05 = 12,2<br>
10str = 10*3,05 = 30,5<br>
10hst = 10 * 2,29 = 22,9<br>
total = 65,6<br>
<br>
<br>
best place to get bonus for chaotic seems to be Chestplate of the Frostborn hero which has RBY sockets and +8str socket bonus. Using +10 stats/+20str/+10str+10hst. EDIT: Best for me since that piece of gear isn't going to change for a while for me.<br>
<br>
Also t9,5helm has +8str bonus and yellow socket. T9 gloves has yellow socket and +4str bonus, T9 pants has yellow socket and +6str bonus . It seems strange to swap out so many +10str for +4str/+10hst etc but math doesn't lie I guess.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Have you run that through Zerek's gear optimiser? As when I run the full 245 sets (25 man + 10 man heroic) I get shoulders, chest, gloves + legs for the 245 set, with <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100305012024/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=48015" target="_blank">[Sunreaver Champion's Faceplate]</a>. I'm sure it depends a lot on whether or not you can run 10 man heroic though.<br>
<br>
Edit: Did some more runs through the gear optimiser, seems the difference (for humans at least) between having the helm and the legs as the non-set piece is only 3 AP, so getting what you can would probably be best in that situation.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">As I understand it the priority is basically the standard IT/PS - SS - BS - BS - DC - (HoW) - DC -&gt; repeat; I use that to start but I find myself falling into a SS - IT/PS - BS - BS - DC - DC priority for the subsequent ones as sometimes I just don't have luck with Virulence. It doesn't look or feel like it's a dps loss as those 2 FU pairs are subsequently used, so am I fine going about it like this?</div>

</div>I was wondering about it too at the beginning. If we don't look at disease ticks, doing SS before re-applying diseases would be a dps gain since SS&gt;IT+PS and SS procs things. However diseases tick each 3 seconds and if you do your SS first you will reapply Blood Plague at 13.5 seconds which is a 1.5sec loss in disease damage while doing PS/IT before SS will re-apply diseases at 12seconds so you'll get your 12sec tick and you'll re-apply just after.<br>
<br>
Personally (and I miss the T9 4pc bonus) I get in average<br>
<br>
SS : 6084.8<br>
PS : 3122.1<br>
IT : 2283.4<br>
FF one tick :  1139.6<br>
BB one tick :  1108.8<br>
<br>
SS-PS-IT =679.3<br>
and half (1.5/3) of a tick for both diseases = 1124.2<br>
<br>
So I'm gessing maximizing the disease ticks should be the priority. Maybe we should always try to refresh at 12 seconds. For example, if you do not HoW in first line, it means you have to SS before refreshing.<br>
<br>
So either I'm doing something wrong or maybe the priority system is not exactly what we should aim for. Or, lets say, use the usual priority system but always refresh diseases at 12 seconds.<br>
<br>
EDIT : as Grigori points out down there, it becomes more complex when you factor haste in that...<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I thought if anything was different with SS first it would be something like that, but I completely missed the tick synchs. You're right that especially with 4t9 that disease delay might be bad. Also it's likely just a matter of habit, after all the chance of SoV not proccing is pretty small. Also, I think the SoV proccing is only slightly weaker during the first segment anyway, since subsequent ones incorporate 1+1 SS total at least till the duration is up.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Conclusions:<br>
<br>
-	As expected the epidemic builds yield a little bit more AoE dps, but you are restricted to apply your diseases every 20 seconds. Do it more often and you will lose your advantage of epidemic. (Spec E+F, RotaAE3 + RotaAE4)<br>
<br>
-	Using D&amp;D every 15 Seconds is not really a dps increase. It is a dps loss, because you are either loosing disease uptime (AE5+AE6) or you lose uptime on Virulence-Buff from SS and clip your diseases (AE7). I actually tried to sim it with a priority file, which yielded around 10200 dps. It would be even more complicated to get it synced with epidemic and longer diseases. Do you guys really have the time in combat to perfectly do a 40 Second-AoE-Rotation without any error and additional spawning adds? I don’t have this time. I will just stick to RotaAoE1, because it is what it is: Just plain simple.<br>
<br>
-	Doing AoE without the Buff from Desolation. (5% actually) is a dps loss. More Targets just increase the gap. We had actually thought, not to use BS in an AoE Situation. But you have to use BS when you don´t have the Buff from Desolation and only BB when you already have it. (RotaAE1 uses BS, RotaAE2 uses BB). Without epidemic you will NEVER BB again. RotaAE3 does one BS in 20 Seconds and one BB, RotaAE4 only does 2xBB in 20 Seconds resulting in a dps loss.<br>
<br>
-	BUT there is 4PCT9!<br>
<br>
     o	Doing the sims with 5 Targets and 4PCT9 and RotaAE1: <br>
        	Spec A: 19883dps / Spec C: 19878dps / Spec G: 19984dps<br>
<br>
     o	Doing the sims with 1 Target and 4PCT9 and RotaSingle1:<br>
        	Spec A: 8421dps / Spec C: 8420dps /  Spec G: 8419dps<br>
<br>
-	For me Spec A is the overall winner, because you will have it before 4PCT9 and you will have it, when the new Tier10 Sets are coming (0.5% of my damage in an infinite AoE Encounter does not push Spec G ahead.. Flexibility and easy switching in AoE Encounters do easily undo the 400 dps gap fighting against three targets or the gap of 900 dps against 5 Targets (one BB more instead of one Pest per 20 seconds). I will just drop one point in Dark Conviction and be fine with it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Not sure if this was identified earlier but this post started a large misconception that Bone Shield will only last 1 minue from now on.  However based on the official patch notes there is absolutely no mention of reduction in the Bone shield duration, only the cooldown which is effectively a buff for tanking and dps by allowing more frequent application (helps with shield loss due to aggro pulls during AOE)<br>
<br>
<u>Patch Notes Quote</u><br>
Bone Shield: This ability now has 3 charges instead of 4. Cooldown reduced to 1 minute.<br>

	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>When you PMed me with those two pages of sim details and asked me to point to the culprit last week, I only had the time to include a cursory explanation in my reply. Since the 13-GCD rotation is revelant to the 2H Unholy DPS discussion, I will explain it in more detail here.<br>
<br>
The theoretical "lossless" threshold for 13-GCD rotations is ~115 ms with 5% haste from rating in raids, although some people can supposedly execute the rotation losslessly at in-game latency up to 40 ms higher (timestamp log on a target dummy to see if you can at your own latency and haste rating).<br>
<br>
Using the following numbers for simplicity:<br>
<br>
1.5 strike GCD<br>
1.33 spell GCD<br>
0.11 effective latency<br>
<br>
Starting with HoW using the following 13-GCD rotation:<br>
<br>
SS&gt;BS&gt;BS&gt;dc&gt;PS&gt;IT<br>
SS&gt;dc&gt;SS&gt;dc&gt;PS&gt;IT&gt;dc<br>
<br>
The first half of the rotation has a minimum length of 9.32 sec and the second half of 10.59 sec. The first time the rotation is executed, the two-rune-set rotation is effectively 20.59 sec long, because the runes used for the first SS won't be up yet until 10 sec after it has been used. However, on the third rune set (first half of the second rotation), the leading SS runes will be used 0.59 sec after they have already cooled down due to the second rune set being 10.59 sec long, so now the 4th rune set can start 0.59 sec earlier (instead of idling and waiting for the FU runes to activate like the second rune set) and the second rotation's effective length becomes 20 sec.<br>
<br>
Rotations after that will be 20 sec long (as the 2-sec leeway is based on delay, your theoretical average rune CD cannot go below 10 sec without IUP; whatever CD you gain from one rune set has to come out of another). In other words, some runes are by design to be used early and late alternately (~9/~11) in order to use idle time from one rune set to cover spillover from the other.<br>
<br>
The catch is that the grace period use for the "short-long shift" has to line up with the asymmetrical rune usage in the rotation (in this case, the Blood rune in BS+BS/SS). For example, unlike the rotation listed above, the following rotation cannot be executed losslessly without excessive haste because the "short-long shift" doesn't line up with its asymmetrical rune use, and you end up waiting on a Blood rune:<br>
<br>
SS&gt;BS&gt;BS&gt;dc&gt;PS&gt;IT&gt;dc<br>
SS&gt;dc&gt;SS&gt;dc&gt;PS&gt;IT<br>
<br>
 - - -<br>
<br>
Now, even when I use the sim in continuous mode (as opposed to many-short-sims mode), the sim results in significantly fewer rotations with...<br>
<br>
SS&gt;BS&gt;BS&gt;dc&gt;PS&gt;IT<br>
SS&gt;dc&gt;SS&gt;dc&gt;PS&gt;IT&gt;dc<br>
<br>
...than it does with...<br>
<br>
SS&gt;BS&gt;BS&gt;dc&gt;PS&gt;IT<br>
SS&gt;dc&gt;SS&gt;dc&gt;PS&gt;IT<br>
<br>
...even though in the long term both rotations take 20 sec to execute. The 13-GCD rotation continues to lose rotations compared to the 12-GCD rotation until a latency setting of ~25-30 ms (which is sufficient to shrink the second rune set in the 13-GCD rotation to 10 sec).<br>
<br>
You can get a rough idea of what the 13-GCD rotation can do if simmed properly by setting the latency to ~25 ms, but this results in disease tick loss. The disease tick loss is consistent with that latency setting, which shrinks the first rune set to below 9 sec, thus resulting in disease tick loss (however, this ought to occur only if the sim starts the long rune set early and I'm not sure it does given the above).<br>
<br>
At the above stats, 13-GCD Reaping GoIT will beat 14-GCD Reapingless GoIT by about 100 DPS by my calculations. At 0.15 theoretical latency, 13-GCD will reach that margin of superiority at ~370 haste rating. 13-GCD will win with most normal latency/haste rating combinations; by how much depends on how close you are to the 13-GCD latency/haste rating sweet spot (the biggest margin of superiority occurs when the two halves of your rotation add up to exactly 20 sec).<br>
<br>
14-GCD wins with either a combination of high latency/low haste rating or a combination of low latency/very high haste rating (or Bloodlust). Since your effective latency depends on you as well as the latency displayed in-game, you will probably want to determine your own haste threshold by time-logging some dummy tests yourself with raid spell haste from others (or yourself if you multi-box). 13-GCD often wins even when the rotation goes over 20 sec; it depends on how much you go over (or under, but under is harder to test).<br>
<br>
 - - -<br>
 <br>
The disease tick loss with IUP Consider speaks of is real in practice. You can gain back the time lost to tiny rune timing fluctuations with the 1-sec grace period, but you basically have even odds on whether a disease refresh occurs just under or just over 9 sec. This puts IUP very close to 14-GCD builds depending on your haste rating (behind 13-GCD Reaping GoIT with most normal latency/haste combinations).<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">According to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100309182202/http://www.mmo-champion.com/news-2/patch-3-2-2-on-live-servers-this-week/" target="_blank">MMO-Champion</a> the patch will go live this week.<br>
<br>
From the patch notes it seems the changes relevant to SS are still in, even if a working SS rotation is already live. As a side note there is no mention of reduced duration for Bone Shield, only reduced cooldown. There is mention of a 4pT9 fix.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Whether the patch includes the Bone Shield nerf makes a difference in spec choice. In the 1/2 Epidemic Reaping GoIT build, you simply replace a PS with a Bone Shield every minute, which beats using a BT Death rune to insert a Bone Shield every minute (BT is still available with PS replacement, of course). For 14-GCD Reapingless GoIT, it is better to refresh Bone Shield by replacing a BS with, not by inserting, a BT/Bone Shield. Remember, BS is below your rotation average in damage (while a BT/Bone Shield once per minute is above). Unless you have just the right latency/haste combination to <i>consistently</i> increase your effective disease uptime substantially with an insertion over a replacement (generally speaking, you do not), replacement gives you higher DPS than insertion.<br>
<br>
Now, even in 3.2.2, SS is so weak that SS - BS once every 20 sec is significantly behind 3 talent points if you can mitigate some of the RP difference; the Bone Shield nerf lets you do that. You can go to a 13-GCD rotation with a Reapingless GoIT build using 3xBS every 20 sec. This reduces your RP generation enough that you have to skip a DC once every 1+ min. Filling this empty GCD with BT/Bone Shield once a minute, you will beat even 0/2 Epidemic 13-GCD Reaping GoIT with BT/Bone Shield refresh insertion by ~30 DPS. In external RP situations you simply skip additional BS. You would have had to decide whether the small gain was worth the loss in flexibility of having Death runes (and the simplicity of 1/2 Epidemic Bone Shield refresh if you go that route), had the Bone Shield nerf made it to live.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1397463"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Uh, crap. I kinda thought I had another week until the patch went live, so wasn't completely done with my front page update. I still wanted to change some formatting stuff, add a section on Unholy DPS verse Blood/Frost (since that gets asked a million and one times, and since the need for a SS vs Ob section is gone), add in stat weights for the variations*, and so on - in addition to whatever Bensch posted above which I don't quite have the time to read atm. What can you do &gt;&lt;. Have a meeting I have to be at in 15 minutes, so heading out like now, but I'll work on it this evening. I went ahead and redid it with what I have, so it should be relatively decent until then, at least, as it wasn't <i>that</i> incomplete.<br>

*For the curious, I did the IUP spec/rotation/etc stat weights. Haste absolutely plummets in value. Down to 1.26 which puts it below ArP.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1397513"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->@ Bensch : tx for the sims, the fact the BS&gt;BB when desolation is down was unexpected (for me at least). Good to know.<br>
<br>
@ Grigori : tx for your explanations, however it seems hard to apply in practice... depends on lattency (which variates), personal gear...<br>
<br>
Maybe if we had an addon which would tells us when our diseases tick (or maybe when they do not tick), then it would be much easier to reapply disease at the right time (So that we never reapply between two ticks).<br>
<br>
EDIT : I know there are addons to track diseases but they generally only put a timer. It's easy with them to see that diseases are going to fall, but much harder to always look at the timer and say for example : 'ok, I'm at 11.68seconds on BB, next GCD will end at 12.11, I need to refresh at this moment'.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

As detailed on the OP the average stat weight for T9-4p is 647.46. This, along with the relative minor stat gains from the 232 pieces, should make the 4pc a priority for many (if not all) Unholy dps builds.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

When I wrote this observation I was under the impression that Bone Shield would only have a duration of 1 min.  Now that it appears that Bone Shield is going to remain as a 5 min duration the need to "slip" it into our rotations every min is gone.  The technique I was describing goes as such:<br>
<br>
IT - PS - SS - BS - BS - BT - Bone Shield- DC - DC<br>
<br>
By slipping the BT - Bone Shiled in at that time both death runes are on cool down so you're always going to use the death rune created by BT when refreshing Bone shield (Unless your lag is horrible)<br>
<br>
EDIT:  At this time there seems to be some confussion about the durration of Bone Shield (1 min vs 5 min).  If the change has been made to Bone Shield lasting 1 min then the technique I suggested above I have found to be highly effective at keeping Bone Shield up while not messing up your rotation.  In the middle of a (house) move right now though so I don't have the time to confirm Bone Shields rotation atm.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>We just had Diospadre confirm that Bone Shield lasts 1 minute.  If that is the case, then your rotation would probably be the optimal way to fit Bone Shield in with a Blood Tap.  It would allow us to use our two blood strikes, then immediately pop BT and then Bone Shield.  When the time comes for the next set of Blood Strikes, by the time you are done using your first Blood Strike, your next Blood strike should be up (or close to up).  <br>
<br>
The only problem I see with this, and a major one at that, is the C/D on Bone Shield perhaps causing a delay with the C/D of BT, leading to a delay in your 2nd Blood Strike once it is time for that in your rotation.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>This was quoted from a blue post. However I saw on the screenshots Puppi posted yesterday that the shadow part do get partial resists on the "Boss" target dummy.<br>
I believe it could be a non-issue in PvE. After all, spell dmg is mitigated for everyone on bosses, and the current / live version of SS is no exception.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure if anyone on Ptr already got to test it in PvPsituations, but I would like to know if the shadow part get mitigated by magic resistance / -spell dmg talents. I'm afraid it will but the blue poster I quoted above kind of confused me a little.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>How would we put 61 points into Unholy?  The base would be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100226183242/http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?deathknight#flc-5OmcmfrOt,,10571" target="_blank">0/0/60</a>, and that leaves only a few talents open..  Of those only Corpse Explosion and Imp Unholy would have a DPS gain...  As good as the extra movement is, wouldn't Subversion perhaps be better?  If the shadow part of SS can crit separately, couldn't a case be made for Sub instead of IUP?<br>
<br>
For the heck of it, I did some crunching on Black Ice  From your calculations it would go up to 1.5611 times the physical portion, or in the example 6244 for a total of 10244 or so.  This looks to come out to a 4% or so increase to SS alone.<br>
<br>
One last question we might need to confirm is whether SS could potentially double dip from the crit bonus from Vicious Strikes in a future build.  Although unlikely, it might come out to be that given the shadow part should crit by itself, it may also get another bonus should it and the physical strike crit.  If that's the case then <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100226183242/http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?deathknight#8lPGUT2fMpwV,,10571" target="_blank">3/8/60</a> could have some strong results.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>GF would be a loss (or at the very least would screw up a rotation) for us as it would prevent the use of a third SS, which by the looks of it is what we will be shooting for since it will do more damage than PS+IT and hopefully 2x BS as well.  This would put it along the line with Frost's typical rotation of<br>
<br>
IT-PS-BS-(FU)-BS-Dump<br>
(FU)-(FU)-(FU)-Dump<br>
<br>
Where (FU) is the spec's main Frost/Unholy rune combo.  The reason for a BS before the first SS is to proc Desolation.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				</div>
				<div style="font-style:italic">Some simple math, for the time being. Should give people a rough idea until the sim is updated or what have you.<br>
<br>
I assume Black Ice still isn't taken because, if anything, this actually makes BI worse (as the shadow portion of the new SS won't out damage the entirety of the current SS). I also assume the shadow portion of SS is not affected by 2H specialization, as it appears as if it shouldn't be. Last, but not least, I assume the second portion shouldn't be affected by impurity in the fashion it is (reportedly) being affected by it on the PTR.<br>
<br>
Damage the shadow portion deals relative to the physical portion:<br>
0.75 (base) x 1.15 (Blood Presence) x 1.1 (Rage of Rivendare) x 1.05 (Desolation) x 1.02 (Bone Shield) x 1.13 (Ebon Plague) x 1.20 (Outbreak) x 1.03 (Ferocious Inspiration) = 1.41918226.<br>
<br>
So, if the physical portion does 4000 damage (which is, approximately, what it should deal in current level gear with appropriate raid buffs, as shown by one's average PS hit. It would actually be somewhat higher, but regardless, 4000 is a nice easy number to work with), then the shadow portion will deal 4000 x 1.41918226 = 5676. That means one SS, on average, would deal about 9700 damage. And this is ignoring the second part being able to crit. And this is rounding down the damage the physical portion would probably deal.<br>
<br>
In other words, this is an underestimation, if anything.<br>
<br>
That's about a 2700 damage increase over the current SS. Which is almost enough (and probably will be enough after 4p t9 is nerfed/dropped, and if you actually did the 'real' math) to push Reaping over the top. Especially when you factor in 2p t10 and 4p t10, both of which are fantastic if this double dips into them.<br>
<br>
I would put my money on 11/0/60 being the build to be, although 0/10/61 is a possibility.<br>
<br>
Also, even ignoring Reaping, this easily covers the UB nerf (and then some). Our dps, even if we didn't change specs/rotations, would go up.<br>
<br>
Edit: One question this leaves open is how the new SS is affected by SoA. Even with a 'normal' rotation of 4 SS per 20 seconds, it would still take a lot for SoA to be superior to SoV (or to the new Sigil), but if it double dipped, it could be a possibility.</div>

I think you are calculating to much in our favour, Consider.<br>
<br>
As GC mentioned in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100226183242/http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=20433766548&amp;sid=1&amp;pageNo=4#72" target="_blank">this post</a> the shadow part will just be raised by all things, that buff Shadow-Dmg.<br>
<br>
So i think you have to take out Outbreak and Rage of Rivendare.<br>
<br>
4000 Physical will be (4000x0.75x1.15x1.05x1.02x1.13x1.03) = 4300<br>
<br>
Looking at Puupi´s Numbers: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100226183242/http://elitistjerks.com/f72/t72364-unholy_dps_scourge_strike_neverending_dream/p35/#post1423560" target="_blank">Screenshots</a><br>
<br>
He did a 4400 physical crit and (4133 + 406) = 4539 shadow damage.<br>
<br>
4400 Physical (crit) will be 4730 Shadow Damage, but he misses Ferocious Inspiration, so it will be 4730 / 1.03 = 4592 shadow damage.<br>
<br>
There is only a little difference in the numbers. ( Actually 53 Damage) But this differnce could result from the partial resist. <br>
<br>
But looking at his Screenshot, there is another Scourge-Strike listed:<br>
<br>
And now <b>look </b>at this numbers:<br>
<br>
4356 Physical (crit) <br>
<br>
he did 4547 shadow damage<br>
<br>
my calcs would result in (4356x0.75x1.15x1.05x1.02x1.13) = 4546,89 Damage<br>
<br>
He did 4547 shadow damage and i would calculate 4546,89.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
4372 Physical Hit (crit)<br>
<br>
6346 Shadow hit (crit) (404 resisted)<br>
<br>
<br>
If we take Bensch's numbers above (0.75x1.15x1.05x1.02x1.13) we get 1.0438<br>
<br>
If Multiply 4372x1.0438x2(crit) we get 9127 and change, which is far higher than actual results.<br>
<br>
But if you take our 1.0438 Shadow Multiplier, and simply ADD a 50% crit bonus to it, we get:<br>
<br>
4372x1.5438 = 6749.5957955, rounded up to 6750.  Which is exactly what the crit was, when you add in the resist.<br>
<br>
Needs more testing than simply one hit, but my current hypothesis is that the crit on the shadow is simply a straight +50% of whatever the physical was, without any other bonuses (which is doubly wrong, as it should be 100%, and it should be affected by talents).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1425215"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Here is a set of data from the PTR, using the premade DK in a standard 14/0/57 build (no reaping).  I made very sure that Bone Shield, Desolation, and all three diseases were up every time I hit SS.  I've broken the table into four parts: Non-shadow crits with no resists, Non-shadow crits with partial resists, Shadow crits with no resists, and Shadow Crits with partial resists.  For the non-crits, I added in the expected 1.0438 result (rounded off).<br>

From these results, I conclude that the 1.0438 multiplier is spot on as long as there's no partial resist, but whenever there is a resist, something gets lost.  I'll play with the math more and see what I can figure out.<br>
<br>
Edit:  From what I can gather, on Shadow crits we're gaining x1.5 for the crit (which should be x2.3) and x1.03 from somewhere.  I can't think of what would give us a 3% bonus, unless it's Impurity.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

"Another side note, when you see a strike that says, say "Your SS hits X for 4000 (200 resisted)", you wouldn't have originally done 4200 damage, but actually quite a bit more. The (X resisted) is actually before modifiers/buffs/talents/crits, so in reality, if half a strike was resisted, you might actually see something like "Your SS hits for 2.5k (1.9k resisted)". Just some food for thought. I can't tell you how many time's I've seen 5500(900 resisted) when my SS crits that don't resist always break 8k."<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I believe you are correct.  Going back over, I find that the formula ((PhysDmg x .75 x 1.15 x 1.05 x 1.02) - Resist) then x1.13 for EP gives the actual amount done.  <br>
<br>
Though to be honest, it wasn't the resist discrepancy I was concerned about; it's the fact that the shadow portion is using Spell Hit and the x1.5 spell crit formula.<br>
<br>
Of course, the 10-20% resist rate on the shadow portion is also worrysome.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

As you can see in every case you just need to scale the amount resisted up by 13% to keep in line with the non-partially resisted data. So the partial resist is just being calculated before the ebon plaguebringer scaling is applied. It is worth noting that this does not end up costing you any DPS since the partial resist would just remove more damage if it was applied after, it just makes the numbers reported look odd.<br>
<br>

		<div id="post_message_1425441"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Although I can undertand Outbreak not double-dipping, RoR seems somewhat odd. Regardless, actually getting on the PTR, I receive similar numbers - an approximate 1.0438 modifier. <br>
<br>
Which is still a clear improvement over the current SS and, with crit working properly on the shadow half, probably still enough for Reaping. If you assume a 200% crit modifier (which isn't affected by Viscious Strikes), and a 35% crit rate, that brings the shadow half up to 1.40913, which places your average SS at slightly above 9600 (if you use 4k as a base number for the physical portion). If, however, you assume the crit rate of the shadow half is affected by Subversion/Viscious Strikes, putting it at 50% crit, you then get a modifier of 1.5657, which puts your average SS at slightly over 10,000. <br>
<br>
If the crit modifier on the shadow half is supposed to be affected by Chaotic/Relentless and/or Viscious Strikes, that would further inflate the numbers.<br>
<br>
Either scenario would be enough for Reaping to be superior to the <i>current</i> Dark Conviction.  I say current because DC's value will change as well - it will go down a lot with the 4p t9 nerf/drop, and go up some because of the SS change. Most likely down more than up, which would give Reaping an even wider lead.<br>
<br>
Anyways, calculating the value of Black Ice is simple enough, Jackinthegreen.<br>
 <br>
Damage without Black Ice: 1 + 1.0438 = 2.0438<br>
Damage with Black Ice: 1 + (1.0438 x 1.1) = 2.14818<br>
<br>
Essentially a 5.107153% increase in total SS damage.<br>
<br>
2H Weapon Specialization, on the other hand, provides nearly the same bonus (4% exactly, as the second portion doesn't double dip), except for the fact that you lose much less speccing into Blood than you do speccing into Frost (partially because there's nothing in Frost aside from Black Ice and Annihilation, partially because Black Ice is an expensive talent, and partially because you have to go into Blood for Subversion anyways).<br>
<br>
When you consider the UB nerf, fewer DCs being casted (due to the GoIT change, and the fact that even without GoIT, a 20 second rotation produces less RP), and the nerf/eventually loss of 4p t9, on top of it's weaker affect on SS, Black Ice is going to be even less competitive than it is now.<br>
<br>
Edit: It's still too early to calculate EP values, as the sim isn't quite right yet. If I were to guess (emphasis on guess), haste will be around 1.6, ArP will be around 1.4-1.8, and crit (without 4p t9) will be around ~1.8.  Merely guesses, however, based on current/past values.<br>
<br>
Edit 2: The sim is still showing Reaping as a dps loss, regardless of the combination I try. SS simply isn't doing quite as much as damage as I thought (various reasons as to why). Epidemic is definitely a go, however. Black Ice is not worth it, as expected. Without 4p t9 or with it nerfed, BA &gt; DC, point for point.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Crit was 2.1 with 4p t9. Agi was 1.43.<br>
<br>
All seems fine, except haste. There can't be any way that's right. It's even higher than the current value - and without the current GoIT and with Epidemic, we should have plenty of free GCDs. It doesn't make any sense, unless I'm missing something. The other numbers all seem logical enough, however.<br>
<br>
Doing seperate sims, increasing haste (aside from it's normal function of increased white/ghoul/garg damage) appears to increase the number of abilities you do (SS, BS, DC, etc). That shouldn't be the case with Epidemic. PS IT SS BS BS DC DC // SS SS BS BS DC, with 5 RP leftover. That's 12 globals, or 18 seconds. Even if you used HoW on CD, which the sim is likely doing, that's still only 13 - 19.5 seconds. Either way, I don't see how the sim is getting haste to increase yellow damage, which it somehow is - and by doing so, is giving a high haste value.<br>
<br>
If you do three sims (one with X stats, one with X stats plus 100 haste, and one with x stats plus 200 AP), and then manually calculate how much dps the "X stats plus 100 haste" gains over the base "X stats" run <i>from auto attack, ghoul, and gargoyle alone</i>, and then divide that difference by how much the 200 AP gave, you get a much more reasonable EP value of 1.505.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>It's hard to say exactly why you have this issue. A Few possibility:<br>
- There is a problem with the sim due to the recent changes to support epidemic less priority mode.<br>
- High latency.<br>
- Your character haste is giving you a lot of disease clipping.<br>
- the Random Number Generator don't like you.<br>
<br>
 I reproduce it so I will try to take a look at it by analyzing the combat log. However, you are right on what you have done manually, this is how the sim does too but with 50 haste / 100 AP.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

    * 1) Scourge Strike should crit for 200% damage like other DK spell effects.<br>
    * 2) The Shadow part of the damage should never miss if the physical part hits.<br>
    * 3) The Shadow part of the damage should never be decreased additionally to the physical damage. It should not "double dip" from resilience et al. Example: My physical portion that hits for 2000 is reduced to 1000. The Shadow part should then hit for 1000 (modulo bonuses) and not 500 or whatever.<br>
    * 4) The Shadow part of the damage will still be increased additionally by talents and anything else that buff Shadow damage. It will "double dip" in the DKs favor.

<br>
Scourge Strike Damage<br>
Only the physical damage can be reduced. The Shadow damage can only be buffed, since it is essentially already reduced by the physical mitigation, resilience or other defensive effects.<br>
<br>
The intent was just to split the damage into part physical and part Shadow. We didn't want the split itself to be a penalty, if that makes sense.</i><br>

		<div id="post_message_1425857"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I've got a build suggestion that could use some Sim testing, if someone doesn't mind. (I'm stuck at work and can't do it myself)<br>
<br>
Suggested build: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100226183242/http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?deathknight#BTnLhiE6XxEnjZ,Q6F3eO,10571" target="_blank">http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?deat...Z,Q6F3eO,10571</a><br>
Yes, the glyph's selected in this build have been chosen intentionally.<br>
<br>
I waited to hear from GC on the "intended" functionality of the SS changes, to create this build. Based on what GC has outlined; I'm now bringing this to our Unholy DPS community for review, scrutiny, suggestions, and Sim testing.<br>
<br>
This build w/glyphs will extend BP to 24sec and FF to 21sec. Allowing for a longer rotation and more RP to use. this "SHOULD" also give us a sizable dps increase as well; if I correctly understood GC's explanation of what the shadow damage portion of SS will benefit/increase from, as well as correctly built the following rotation suggestion.<br>
<br>
Rotation Suggestion: First Half- PS,IT,SS,BS,BS,HoW,Garg  <br>
                          Second Half- SS,SS,SS, DC DUMP<br>
<br>
This rotation suggestion seems to leave an extra 3RP at the end, so long as my math is correct. Please let me know if it's not; so that I can go through and fix it. <br>
This rotation should be close to 24sec in length, possibly ~1 or 2 seconds shorter. The way I've done this allows you to repeat the rotation over and over, for the duration of a boss encounter. If you do, you will need to substitute the use of Garg in the first half with a DC DUMP. Based on a ~4 to 5min encounter duration you should be able to use the Garg twice. More if the encounter is even longer. <br>
You will have to figure out the timing of when to revert back to Garg use roation, based on each boss encounter that allows for more than one use of Garg. Typically though, you should use it every time it's up while your damage increasing procs/effects are active on you.<br>
<br>
This will allow us to make the most of our PS/IT disease applications without clipping them and reapplying them with ~1 or 2 seconds where the diseases aren't up, allowing a latency of ~160ms.<br>
<br>
I haven't had a chance to test any of this out yet as my work and home life keep me rather busy as of late. I will get some testing of my own done, as soon as time allows and will also post results of said testing. <br>
Happy testing to all you decide to help out with this. My general goal of this, is to have provided a "fresh/different" perspective on possible performance/dps increases that may have previously overlooked. <br>
Best case scenario for me would be that this suggestion does give us the sizable dps increase I think it will. Worst case scenario...LodeRunner or someone else at EJ deems this post/suggestion worthless and I receive the "BanHammer" <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100226183242im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/frown.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":(" class="inlineimg"><!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I've always used the Alliance Unholy BiS gearlist from the optimal gearing thread: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100226183259/http://elitistjerks.com/f72/t55505-optimal_gearing_bis_thread/" target="_blank">http://elitistjerks.com/f72/t55505-o...ng_bis_thread/</a> (Mainly because i consider the spellhit to be a big thing to max dps for anub25hc) - but there are things like the <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100226183259/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=47086" target="_blank">[Chestplate of the Frostborn Hero]</a> which would seem to fall behind when the 3.3 proposed weights go live. It has both hit and haste on it, while the craftable chest by comparison goes up in value quite considerably: <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100226183259/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=47589" target="_blank">[Titanium Razorplate]</a><br>
<br>
I guess what i'm trying to say is, we've ignored armor pen for a long while and now its going to be one of our better off-stats. Has anyone put anymore work into an optimal patch-day gearset from items obtainable right now?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1440325"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Assuming Blizzard doesn't drastically change anything, all three specs should be using the same gear in 3.3, besides the fact that Frost will still use 1handed weapons. This means (after hit and exp cap) you will want gear with crit and armor pen on it.<br>

Edit: I guess you wouldn't be using the current BiS Blood set.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Race change is now a reality.  At one point, it was commonly agreed that Orc was the best race for an Unholy DPS Death Knight, due to its increased pet damage, expertise with our most common weapon, and AP boost off the GCD that we could easily combine with Gargoyle and diseases.  Is this still true?  Is Orc the clear winner in terms of DPS gain?</div>

		<div id="post_message_1441667"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Regarding the new stat weights -<br>
<br>
The increase in the value of expertise seems to make sense. For starters, there will be one more BS instead of pestilence, but the real kicker to me seems to be that we will be much more reliant on PS not being dodged to keep up Blood Plague and Rage of Rivendare without slowing down our rotation.<br>
<br>
As for haste dropping like a rock, I think the key is how tight the rotation is. I haven't been playing around on the PTR, but I remember the old SS w/ reaping rotations, and back then I often had times where I was waiting for rune cooldowns and didn't have the runic power to do anything in the meantime. With our current rotation, I'm <b>always</b> pushing buttons, every global cooldown. That means that more haste is actually speeding up your yellow damge as well, to a certain extent, since it's reducing the GCD of IT and DC at the very least. When you have to wait for runes to cooldown, however, you aren't actually speeding up yellow damage, you're just making it more frontloaded.<br>
<br>
It's the same reason an instacast HOTing druid still likes to stack haste while a ret pally doesn't much care for it. A HoTing druid is constantly spamming abilities so lowered GCD means something. A ret, on the other hand, has spells that get reduced too, but if they are sitting there waiting for ability cooldowns, that reduced GCD doesn't mean anything for yellow damage, and the haste to auto-attack doesn't mean much, even with seal damage (which is much more than necrosis).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>It requires you to be able to roll your diseases for at least 4 minutes (assuming fully buffed diseases) for GoD to beat GotG.  If a fight has any movement that makes your diseases drop in that period, the GoD is a DPS loss.  In addition, it increases the likelihood of ghoul death, which is a huge DPS loss.   Even with the buffed NotD, it's a risky HP loss.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1442266"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I did some sims to try and work out exactly why the GoD was a loss, as you can often get max diseases up in a couple of rune rotations.   One thing that I observed is that the average strike damage was down by up to 7% compared to a non-GoD build.  The main reason for this I found for this was that in the GoD rotation you make 1 less strike per 20 second rotation (including normal attacks you make 14 or so strikes in this time without GoD), which lowers your proc chances and can mean a less uptime.   With fallen crusader and 2 proc trinkets that can add up to a noticeably lower average attack power. I didn't even consider 2 piece t9.  <br>

</div>Yes, it is..  But that of course requires a second target that actually lives long enough to use it on as well as managing the diseases on both of them.

</div>Well actually you would be losing a SS (or at least half a SS) as you'd have to pest twice every 20 seconds on one target or the other, and we have to keep up desolation every 20 seconds.  The reason I ask is because while there are fights where you could conceivably be dpsing a single target for 400 seconds or so, all these fights pretty much have at least the occasional adds.    I guess I was just wondering if we could use the poor-mans GoD under certain circumstances to roll diseases.<br>
<br>
Using the set I linked to in my last post but turning off all set bonuses and trinket procs, and disabling all glyphs, I can get some ball park average numbers for the strikes, and then calculate some dps ball parks for glyphs.<br>
<br>
SS hits for 12305.8, BS for 3666.4, PS for 4145.3, IT for 3105.5.<br>
So the margin for a SS over IT and PS is 5955.0, <br>
<br>
Frost Fever dps (inc WP) was 657.5,<br>
so the glyph of icy touch is worth 131.5 dps.<br>
<br>
Death Coil DPS (inc UB) was 787.9,<br>
so the glyph of dark death is worth 118.2 dps.<br>
<br>
Ghoul DPS without glyph was 791.1, and with glyph was 920.1,<br>
so the glpyh of the ghoul is worth 129.0 dps.<br>
<br>
Glyph of Scourge Strike is rather poor at the moment.  It gives diseases with a duration of 30 seconds and so saves us only one application of diseases every minute,<br>
so the glyph is worth 99.25 dps, at a first estimate.<br>
<br>
If instead it boosted our diseases to 41 or 42 seconds it would save 1.5 reapplications a minute and be up there with the other glyphs at 148.9 dps. This seems pretty much where it should be to me.   39 seconds would be a possibility.<br>
<br>
If it gave us rolling diseases it would give us an extra SS every 20 seconds, and be worth 297.75 dps without considering the rolling.   With the glyph extending duration by 3 seconds and at 5 SS every 20 seconds you can't actually extend it infinitely, in fact after 60 seconds, you'd have 3 seconds left on the timers, and the diseases would vanish about the end of that cycle.  <br>
<br>
The above analysis is actually slightly flawed, because you have to consider how many ticks land before refresh and whether your blood plague gets rage of rivendare applied to it.   If you could actually reapply the diseases the instant after they fall, then you gain a tick of the diseases, but blood plague doesn't get the 10% from rage of rivendare applied to it (this is actually worth it, an extra tick of the two diseases outweighs one doing 10% less damage, if you've got less than 20 ticks or so).  Doing that perfectly is actually worth about 78 dps in this simple setup without glyphs or set bonuses and almost 100 dps with 4t9 and GoIT.<br>
<br>
The margin reapplying using a Pest is 2288.6.<br>
so the glyph of disease is worth 114.4 dps, but of course that doesn't consider the effect of rolling the diseases.<br>
The margin reapplying using 2xPest is -1377.8.<br>
so the poor-man's GoD has negative worth at -68.9 dps.  If there's an internal cooldown on wandering plague then you'd further lose out due to missing WP ticks.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1442769"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->GotG wouldn't really give the ghoul more time to heal itself, just let it heal itself for more. It would still be getting damage at a rate of 450 damager every two seconds. The ghoul, at a base attack speed of 2.0 and not taking into account Claw, will heal 2% of it's health every 2 seconds, which should amount to over half of what Frost Aura deals without taking resistances into account.<br>
<br>
I don't think a small amount of damage like that is going to end up being the death of non GotG ghouls, especially if you end up with a shaman in your group for healing stream and other incidental heals. Even Tail Smashes should be dealing relatively little damage to them.<br>
<br>
Blistering Cold could take out chunks of 3500 HP at a time and would be be biggest burst damage the ghoul sees the whole fight assuming you let it eat the damage.<br>
<br>
I don't see anything that might outright kill the ghoul if it didn't have that extra 40% stamina from GotG. In a fight like Sindragosa it'll need heals at some point if it's going to survive the whole fight, and while I don't think the extra stam from GotG is a bad thing or isn't nice, I think it is being somewhat over-valued.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Anyways:<ul><li>Army of the Dead: The cooldown on this ability has been reduced from 20 minutes to 10 minutes. Army Ghoul damage dropped by 50%. Cannot be used in Arenas.</li>
<li>Raise Ally: The cooldown on this ability has been reduced from 15 minutes to 10 minutes. Cannot be used in Arenas.</li>

Only the first of the three really affects dps. Assuming Night of the Dead is cut in half, that means half the CD and half the damage. Better in some cases, worse in others. Just depends on the fight.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The most likely idea is the cooldown will be reduced by 4 minutes.  Shaman have the same issue with the Fire elemental (cooldown is 10 minutes and glyph is -10 minutes off cooldown).<br>
<br>
I prefer the new shorter cooldown, since as Unholy you can use it between attempts @6 minute cooldown.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1447455"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->DW Unholy isn't truly being gutted.  In fact, generally speaking, it will be buffed by the change to Scourge Strike as well when the dust settles.  The issue is the fact that DW relies on better white damage and more Necrosis and BcB damage (relatively speaking) to make up for the fact that Scourge Strike on live hits like a wet noodle with a one hander.  The changes to Scourge Strike will most likely increase DW Unholy's dps overall- but the change increases 2 Handed more.  The heavier base in weapon damage of the strike favors 2H.  The increased damage from SS favors spamming it, utilizing talents like Epidemic and Reaping, which further separates the two specs.  I've really enjoyed DW Unholy in 3.2, but it will be hard to rationalize not going 2handed, when they will have equal AoE, and 2handed will have measurably better single target dps, all with basically the exact same playstyle, if things go live as they are now.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">The most likely idea is the cooldown will be reduced by 5 minutes.  Shaman have the same issue with the Fire elemental (cooldown is 10 minutes and glyph is -10 minutes off cooldown).<br>
<br>
I prefer the new shorter cooldown, since as Unholy you can use it between attempts @5 minute cooldown.</div>

</div>While that's certainly true, cutting the damage in half does reduce the number of situations where you can use it during the fight and it's impact when used pre-pull.<br>
<br>
In other news, using the new simulator with a startup sequence and then a fixed rotation, I get on repeated short 200 second fights the GoD and the GotG within about 50 dps of each other for both 4t9 and 2t9+2t10 setups, and both death's choice trinkets.  With all the breakdowns looking about right.  I actually think the setup is favouring the GotG slightly as the simulator doesn't actually seem to reset everything properly when using the the many fights option.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Sorry for the slow response: You would be correct. I could have sworn it was already there, but perhaps I deleted it at one point for one reason or another. It's there now.<br>
<br>
Also added the AotD/NotD/etc changes. Tweaked the wording of some areas of the upcoming changes section, as parts of it were somewhat less clear than I would have liked. Probably won't edit again until new changes are introduced or the patch goes live.<br>
<br>
Speaking of AotD, to answer a question: yes, it will be worth using during a phase change. On any fight which lasts less than 6 minutes or has no period of time during which you wouldn't be attacking otherwise, it's a nerf. On any fight lasting over 6 minutes and which has a period of time (phase change, for example) during which you wouldn't be able to be dpsing anyways, it's a buff. In terms of TotGC. that would make it a nerf on Jaraxxus and Twins, while a buff on Beasts, FC, and Anub. A wash overall, in my opinion.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Is Mark of Supremacy really that bad? It's not on Kahorie's sim and I'm not quite sure how to rate it.<br>
My problem is I don't have enough dkp for Deaths Verdict or luck w/ Banner of Victory. <br>

</div>Kahorie's doesn't include 'on use' trinkets because unlike trinkets with procs, it's very easy to calculate their AP value. It has nothing to do with 'on use' trinkets being bad (although, generally speaking, they do tend to be inferior to their proc equivalents, but that's simply due to how Blizzard itemizes them). <br>
<br>
Mark of Supremacy gives 1024 AP for 20 seconds every 2 minutes. 1024 x (20/120) = 170.67 AP. Simply add that, on top of the hit, to your character sheet in the sim, or what have you. <br>
<br>
Assuming you can use all of the hit, MoS is excellent. Considering it gets you about half way to the hit cap all by itself, most people find it excessive, and as such pursue other options. That said, DMC: D is kinda bad, so as long as you can fully utilize approximately 60 or so of that hit rating, MoS will win out. You're logged out in your tanking gear, so I have no clue whether or not that's the case.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Ah, hadn't thought to just add in the avg AP of the proc to the sim. ty<br>
<br>
I don't think DMC: D is represented properly in the sim and/or EP calculator. (or I'm missing something)<br>
<br>
when I run EP values on it i get:<br>
<br>
EP: | DeathChoice | 33939 <br>
EP: | Comet | 26969 <br>
EP: | Greatness | 22727<br>
EP: | DarkMatter | 21515 <br>
EP: | Victory | 19696 <br>
EP: | GrimToll | 16363  <br>
EP: | DCDeath | 10606 <br>
  <br>
However, I'm currently simming @ 8054 dps in my gear w/ DMC: D<br>
When I swap it for GrimToll (and adjust stats accordingly), dps drops to 7976.<br>
<br>
My Armory is displaying dps set now.<br>
<br>
Edit: With the proc and hit rating from Supremacy manually added into the sim, I get 8004 dps. But would probably be higher if I can reitemize to use the excess hit.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">On any fight which lasts less than 6 minutes or has no period of time during which you wouldn't be attacking otherwise, it's a nerf. On any fight lasting over 6 minutes and which has a period of time (phase change, for example) during which you wouldn't be able to be dpsing anyways, it's a buff. In terms of TotGC. that would make it a nerf on Jaraxxus and Twins, while a buff on Beasts, FC, and Anub. A wash overall, in my opinion.</div>

</div>Well, with AotD doing half the damage I'm not sure how much of a buff it really is to manage to summon 2 in some odd fight. I mean, generally speaking, two 3.3 armies would do as much damage as one current, for double the effort.<br>
<br>
Then on Beasts, a common heroic kill would be at 7minutes or a bit less, so I would assume the cooldown would be ready around the middle of Icehowl phase. Maybe the stars would align every odd kill and get a charge close enough to not have to run to but far enough to not have to move out and then you have time to summon till he crashes.<br>
<br>
I don't know, no matter how I twist it, it looks like a nerf in almost all cases. At least it will provide a bit more consistency between progress tries on bosses, since you'll probably have it ready every try and not every second.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1451943"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I think with the damage halved on AotD, that the 6 second cast time is simply not worth it halfway into the fight. Unless there is some special situation of course which disallows you to fight for 6 or more seconds (phase change or melee aoe).<br>
<br>
I think the primary benefit of this change should be seen as the fact we can now use army at the start of each fight. That's when i personally try to use it most of the time (again exceptions exist), as that means I dont lose dps time.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1452345"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->In a sense the outcome of the "Nerf" or "Situational Buff", as ever you personally consider it, will be dependant on the <br>
<br>
fights in Icecrown to be honest. We can perceive it as either a time saver (this may enable us to use it on EVERY fight <br>
<br>
pre pull), or this may slightly hurt us, for example: I use AOTD on Icehowl right during transition from the twin worms, <br>
<br>
which disables me from using it on Jaraxxus. So this change can either translate to being a spread out dps from AOTD <br>
<br>
ballance (AOTD used on ALL fights), OR lets say if we do a boss in IC every 3 mins (Highly unrealistic) then it may <br>
<br>
actually hurt us. In the end, I believe that it may be logical to make a minor compedulum when to use AOTD in <br>

I'm not incredible with the math, but I'm near positive that a simple cast reduction baked into NotD would open a few doors . A 3sec channel on AotD would make that window to summon your second pack not so narrow.<br>

</div>The same for me. Army doesn't help us at Lord Jaraaxus (you could summon it long before the fight starts, but i wouldn't risk a wipe because my ghouls taunt the adds so i don't use it at all in heroic), FC (could possibly destroy some CC, we are supposed to not summon any uncontrolable pets) and Anub just at the end, when we already don't focus the adds anymore.<br>
<br>
I think that the only bosses where you can safely use them w/o any raid members whining is NB and Twins. So i think, this will be a straight and big nerf for TOC. I don't know that many ICC encounters to see any benefit from it. <br>
<br>
If they at least halved the cast time to 3 seconds, it might be considered using it again aside of the beginning of some(!) fights.<br>
<br>
Perhaps they simply don't want it to be another DPS cooldown.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1453115"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Indeed you can control them as unholy if you have the ghoul out with MoG, but like fmorrison said you really need to spam the key if so because they are 'designed' to attack strays somehow, or else maybe they go for anything that can be taunted first.<br>
<br>
When I use it, I'm not really concerned about what dps they can do. Sure it's good if they actually help out with it, but the primary use to me is if I can use it as a extra damage mitigation Cd, since it mitigates spell damage as well unlike parry and dodge on their own. the only thing to watch out for in the Anub case is that the freezing slash ends the channeling, so if you want it to mitigate that, use it so that you just have a moment left on the channel as that hits.<br>

See, if you put them side by side, there is a similar kill time, same number of Autoattacks, same number of Wandering Plague hits and around the same disease ticks.

Could someone explain what it is about ilvl which would make a lower AP-equivalent set of items better, just because they have a higher ilvl?<br>

The post stated afaik that there is a 40 DPS gap between 4p T9 and 2P T10. 1 AP = 1 DPS thus Consider took the 40 DPS difference as 40 AP to overcome to make a switch worthwile.<br>
<br>
He further referred to an overall stat upgrade that would occur by ugrading one Tier thus easily achieving those 40 AP to make a switch to 2P T9+2P T10.<br>

		<div id="post_message_1454726"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Considering the Army of the Dead changes I took a look at my last AotD logs and made some math. Seems that at the moment, in live, my AotD is usually worth around 60k damage. When you take into account the 6 second channeling time, this translates to AotD channeling being worth 10 000 dps. This is pretty much always a dps increase. Hwoever, if 3.3 will see 50% drop in damage with no effect on channeling time channeling AotD midfight becomes questionable. <br>
<br>
If you could have kept doing damage with regular rotation during the 6 seconds using AotD is probably dropping your raids total damage due to the risk of Ebon Plague dropping of even for a few seconds. If there is even a few seconds when you can't dps, starting to channel then and losing "only" 3 or 4 seconds of of regular dps time might be worth it and using AotD pre-fight is still as much "free dps" as ever.<br>
<br>
The one thing to consider is that while you are channeling you are doing almost zero dps (barring diesease and UB DoTs) but after the Army is summoned your dps goes up for the duration of the Army. This means starting channeling AotD a few seconds before Anub'arak goes into P3 or other similar situations might actually be worth it still. While its not a dps increase over the whole fight it "pushes" some of the actual damage to later phase of the fight where you'll need it more.<br>

</div>The new Scourge Strike "double dips" into crit - that is, both parts of the attack can crit <b>independently</b> of each other as far as I'm aware. <br>
<br>
This drastically improves the effectiveness of crit - especially a flat out 5% increase to *everything* that can crit (including Blood Plague assuming 4pT9 in 3.3).<br>
<br>
As Scourge Strike will make up the bulk of our damage, the increase this 5% crit gives is far larger than an increase to Death Coil damage (especially considering the halving of UB damage) whilst Necrosis has simply been dropping in relative value since the start of WotLK.<br>
<br>
At least that's my interpretation - at work so couldn't run a sim with Morbidity/Necrosis.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Considering the Army of the Dead changes I took a look at my last AotD logs and made some math. Seems that at the moment, in live, my AotD is usually worth around 60k damage. When you take into account the 6 second channeling time, this translates to AotD channeling being worth 10 000 dps. This is pretty much always a dps increase. Hwoever, if 3.3 will see 50% drop in damage with no effect on channeling time channeling AotD midfight becomes questionable. <br>
<br>
If you could have kept doing damage with regular rotation during the 6 seconds using AotD is probably dropping your raids total damage due to the risk of Ebon Plague dropping of even for a few seconds. If there is even a few seconds when you can't dps, starting to channel then and losing "only" 3 or 4 seconds of of regular dps time might be worth it and using AotD pre-fight is still as much "free dps" as ever.<br>
<br>
The one thing to consider is that while you are channeling you are doing almost zero dps (barring diesease and UB DoTs) but after the Army is summoned your dps goes up for the duration of the Army. This means starting channeling AotD a few seconds before Anub'arak goes into P3 or other similar situations might actually be worth it still. While its not a dps increase over the whole fight it "pushes" some of the actual damage to later phase of the fight where you'll need it more.<br>

</div>Im a bit nosey so i took a look at your actual dps for the fight just for comparison and i noticed your dps is kind of low. I figured maybe you were a bit undergeared but then i took a look around and noticed you have 8 expertise rating. Instead of the actual 26 you need to be cappd and not messing up your rotation. Is that on purpose or......<br>
<br>
It would probably benefit you greatly to get your expertise rating up to par. Youre also grossly above hit cap. good luck.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>If you compare my dps on those logs and my current Armory gear they just don't match. Several nice drops from that run (including heroic version of Reckoning which is even alone a huge dps upgrade) which now show in Armory weren't there when those logs were recorded. Yes, I am above melee hit cap, but not spell hit cap so that additional hit is not wasted as you seemed to imply.<br>
<br>
I will check my gemming again and see if I can improve it. However, statweights suggest that gemming for pure +STR is more effective on point-for-point basis than gemming for +EXP.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1465080"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Okay I went and found a few bugs in the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100312034112/https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AvlB2Y7ry8mcdFRHUEJseVFWcnhGZm13MlRpQlUybHc&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">spreadsheet</a> that I was using to calculate the benefits of various glyphs and the results kind of surprised me a little bit.<br>
For these calculations I'm using base run in the sim using short fights with the unholy 2H T9 profile and GoDD, GoIT and GotG, and then theorycrafting for the GoSS and the new mechanism for GoD.<br>
<br>
GotG remains at <b>155 DPS</b> value.  This value isn't affected by set bonuses other than the 2PT9 and scales better than the other glyphs with Strength, and with haste, however it is the only glyph that doesn't scale with crit rating.<br>
GoIT has about <b>132 DPS</b> value, when measured with 18 disease ticks per minute for the standard rotation.  This value will scale with melee crit due to wandering plague. (But needs about 21 ticks to beat the Ghoul).<br>
GoDD has about a <b>132 DPS</b> value, however it depends on how much extra runic power we can get, that value was for 9 DCs a minute.<br>
<br>
The value of the GoSS and GoD glyphs comes through two source, firstly there's the extra damage from the extra DoT ticks.  For the GoD it's pretty simple, you get 20 ticks per minute.  For the GoSS the diseases run out the instant you're going to reapply them, so I assume you reapply before the tick 50% of the time and after the other 50%.<br>
The other benefit is that you get to replace some disease reapplications with more SSs.  For this reason both these glyphs get some additional benefit from the 4T9 and 2T10 set bonuses.  This means that they scale with ArPen in addition to crit and strength<br>
<br>
<table class="stg_table tborder"><tbody><tr class="alt2"><td>Glyph</td><td>No set</td><td>4T9</td><td>2T10</td><td>4T10</td></tr><tr class="alt1"><td>GoD</td><td>148</td><td> 175</td><td> 210 </td><td> 258</td></tr><tr class="alt2"><td>GoSS </td><td> 120 </td><td> 121</td><td> 141</td><td>145</td></tr></tbody></table><!-- table generated by StG's vB Code [table] v.0.1.6.0 (stable) o.95 --><br>
Note: I'm just considering the set bonuses rather than changing the gear around (and the base numbers were measured using 2T9).  The GoD rotation has 3 attacks less per minute (about 5%) so the proc rates for all melee trinkets etc are a little bit down.  This doesn't have that much effect in general.  More importantly the extra attacks are  blood strikes a minute so the 2T9 bonus is up quite a bit less (15% vs 21% ish).  I've assigned a 50 dps penalty for the first 3 situations for this reason, and a 10 dps penalty for the 4T10 value. (The GoD also pushes the value of the GoIT up to around 150 dps).<br>
<br>
These would suggest that running GoD, GotG and GoIT probably makes sense for the majority of single target situations, at least initially.<br>
<br>
Of course we'd have to simulate the situation once the sim is fully setup for all the 3.3 changes.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I don't get what you are saying. <br>
<br>
Let me explain this differently: If I get 14 AP, then my white DPS will go up by one, assuming my target has no armor and no other stats are involved. Similarly, if I the DPS stat on my weapon increases by one, my white DPS will increase by 1, again assuming no armor and other stats. Therefore, we can conclude that in the case of white damage, 1 weapon DPS is the equivalent of 14 AP. In other words, if damage was purely white, the stat weighting for weapon DPS would 14. Since we know that not all of our damage is directly the result from weapon swings, we must therefore multiply this value by the percent of our damage that is directly the result of the weapons DPS rating (our white hits+necrosis etc). This will give us exactly the stat weighting for weapon DPS.<br>
<br>

</div>Let's demonstrate the concept with a simplified 2-component system:<br>
<br>
Auto: 1 DPS per weapon DPS + 1 DPS per 14 AP<br>
Disease: 1 DPS per 7 AP<br>
<br>
At 200 weapon DPS and 2800 AP:<br>
<br>
Your DPS is 800 (400 from auto and 400 from disease).<br>
<br>
50% DPS from auto<br>
50% DPS from disease<br>
<br>
Your DPS delta per AP is 3/14 (+1/14 DPS from auto and +1/7 DPS from disease).<br>
<br>
~33.33% from auto<br>
~66.67% from disease<br>
<br>
To figure out the weapon DPS stat weight from the AP stat weight, you need to use the percentage of DPS delta per AP that is "white" (3/14 * 14 * 1/3 = 1), not the percentage of DPS that is "white" (3/14 * 14 * 1/2 = 1.5).<br>
<br>

For your second question, I was referring to inaccuracies which arise from using an additive stat weight method on stats which are not strictly additive.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1466454"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->As Grigori points out it's pretty obvious that you can't just do a straight conversion of weapon DPS to AP because there are attacks that don't use the weapon DPS in any form.  However this is true of pretty much all stats.   Strength is the only stat that actually applies to all our attacks (pets, diseases, spells, strikes), but even it doesn't apply to them all equally.<br>
<br>
The use of AP as the baseline for relative stat values is actually an arbitrary choice, in some way DPS would make more sense.  When you run EP values in the simulator it's actually using DPS deltas to estimate partial derivatives of DPS with respect to the various other stats.  It does this by adding a fixed value of a stat to a given gear baseline and then rerunning the simulator.   The value for AP is then used for determining the other values. <br>
<br>
There are several important things to remember.<br>
<br>
Firstly no stat is measured in a vacuum, the baseline is important.  There are no attacks where the contribution of an individual stat can be directly inferred from a damage breakdown.  If you understand the complete mechanics you might be able to look at a detailed enough log and calculate the contribution, but that is pretty impractical.<br>
<br>
Secondly stats have varying sensitivity and influence on the event sequence.   Things like AP, Weapon DPS, Strength ArPen, just change how much various attacks hit for, and so it is reasonably easy to estimate their value using the sim, and their weight will be consistent from run to run.   Other stats like hit, haste and weapon speed however can greatly effect the sequence of events which can make it rather hard to estimate their value.<br>
<br>
Perhaps, most importantly, the quality of the output EP values depend greatly on how good a simulator it is.  Does it have the mechanics right?  Is the situation its modeling reasonable?<br>
<br>
ETA: FWIW, I hacked the simulator source to use the new GoD mechanics, and it confimed my estimate of the values of the different glyphs I mentioned in my last post were in the right ballpark.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
<i>The most optimal spec will become 17/0/54. Taking 1-2 points out of Bladed Armor and putting them into Necrosis is a slight (literally 4-8) dps gain, but when you consider Bladed Armor easily pulls ahead on any fight with multiple targets, most would consider it the obvious choice. Still, Necrosis isn't necessarily wrong if you are trying to eke out each and every drop of single target dps you can.</i><br>
<br>
In this spec, points are put into Reaping. The build has changed a lot since I last looked at it. However....<br>
<br>
<i><b>Why is Reaping no longer considered mandatory or, at the least, optional?</b><br>
Reaping is a raw dps loss. No question. Epidemic at least has some upside in terms of AoE - Reaping is nothing but bad. Two Blood Strikes outdamage a single Scourge Strike at most gear levels, thus you lose dps speccing into Reaping as opposed to just not spending three talent points. That's the dictionary definition of a wasted talent.<br>
Even at gear levels where Scourge Strike will still out damage Blood Strike, you still gain more dps by spending those three points in Bladed Armor and/or Dark Conviction.</i><br>
<br>
I've been taking the build from before apart and putting it back together again, just to see how it ticks, y'know?<br>
I come back to take one more look at it out of game and find that it has changed and there are points in Reaping, which has been stated as a <i>raw dps loss</i>.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1471180"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Those two statements are from two totally separate sections of the OP, one labeled for 3.3.0 and one labeled for 3.2.2. Reaping will be worth it because of the massive (50%+) buff to Scourge Strike. Until that time, however, it's not. I'm not sure how much clear I could make it.<br>
<br>
There is no error... except, possibly, in your ability to read section headings!<br>
<br>
As to Unholy DW builds, yes, comparatively speaking, they will be substantially (5-10% behind) the 2H counterpart in 3.3. This isn't because DW is getting nerfed - it's getting slightly buffed, actually - but because the magnitude of its buff is much, much less than that which 2H is receiving. It's simply a matter of relativity.<br>

I do very much appreciate the detailed work people put in here, particularly as it applies to Unholy spec'd DKs and optimizing DPS.  I try to read most of it, and do tend to follow the recommendations closely, especially those commonly seen at the beginning of these threads.<br>
<br>
With that in mind, I have what may be seen as a simplistic question.  With yet another respec and change to the UH rotation I count 19 key strokes to the new "single target" rotation.  Even then it doesn't repeat from the beginning if I read correctly.  How is anyone actually able to remember this rotation, as a practical matter?<br>
<br>
I do enjoy playing my DK as my main, but I have to say that after so many changes to spec'ing and rotations this past year, my frustration with the ever increasing complexity to basic "play" has made me take a fresh look at my hunter.  Can anyone offer some alternative to the new rotation, without diminishing DK abilities too considerably?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yeah, I kinda got there with the last rotation, and was able to improvise a bit even in given situations.  That said though, and I hope I'm not the only one, runes have always been a bit of a mystery to me, despite having read up on them more than once.  At some point I kind of intuited the mechanics, but not because I ever really understood the explanations I read (at WoWHead, WoWWiki).<br>
<br>
Thanks a lot for this.  It will help a lot.  I found the new rotation daunting, to say the least <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100310014526im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":)" class="inlineimg"><!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1484646"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->All of the 3.3 items are on Armory now. I've been trying to make some gear sets and its pretty weird. Basically, the highest single target DPS sets you can make consist of 4pc set (minus legs) and leather/plate Arpen gear up to 1400. <br>
<br>
However, for AoE fights, this obviously isn't going to be the best. There's going to have to be a decision on the players part if they want to do 5%~ more damage on a single target at the cost of a pretty significant AoE portion. This will probably depend on which encounters are the most challenging. <br>
<br>
Of the stuff released so far, I feel like the Arpen set would have performed better on all of the fights except the gunship battle.<br>
<br>
Looking into future encounters, it doesn't really seem like theres a heavy AoE fight like we saw with Anub. I'm leaning towards stacking Arpen for an ideal set for ICC.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1484649"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The Armory still doesn't include Arthas loot, actually.<br>
<br>
That aside, I'm still not getting how gearing changes so radically between AoE and Single Target (<i>ignoring gemming</i>) Stacking ArP on gear doesn't come at the expense of Str, but of haste (or possibly crit, but rarely). That's all. Haste is no better for AoE. Worse, actually. <br>
<br>
Yes, there might be some slight differences in str/crit, of course, but it really shouldn't be anything that large, and I still can't see a single target BiS list drastically differing from an AoE BiS list (Assuming 4P T9 wouldn't still be necessary for the latter, and ignoring the aforementioned potential for gemming ArP). Perhaps a piece or two, but that'ld be about it. <br>
<br>
But, at any rate, I would agree - ICC certainly has a much smaller emphasis on concentrated AoE (although incidental AoE is as omnipresent as ever). Simply don't believe that will largely influence our gearing decisions - ArP may be great, yes, but if we don't take it for AoE, what stats do we get in return? Nothing of greater value for AoE, in the vast majority of cases.<br>
<br>
Anyways, as to the different rotation Diospadre, like you said, that's really the same thing - simply swapping the BS/Pest with the following SS. The difference is that SS getting the benefit of Desolation or diseases (and BS) getting the benefit of your sigil/possibly an additional trinket proc. It's slight either way - even smaller than IT/PS. Personally I prefer what I listed due to the fact that on most fights there are adds (or simply stuff like spines on Marrowgar) which means that you then have to factor in the additional dps of diseases being spread sooner. To each their own, however. Quite minor.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Now, Ive tried to insert the usage of this macro either at the end of a UFUFBB or a UFUFDD, when all runes are on cooldown, and my blood/death runes were used most recently.<br>

When i use it at the end of UFUFBB, my next set of runes obviously comes up as UFUBD (because the rune was now used on Bone sheild and not pest or BS), And i lose a SS in that set.<br>
<br>
When i use it at the end of UFUFDD, then my next set is UFUFBD, No problem, ill use the D on my pest or BS.  But the set after that shows UFUDD initially, but because the Bloodtap buff is now expiring, as i approach the third SS in that set, one of the D runes goes B and I cant SS!  Im not really sure i understand why it does this.  The Blood taped rune was already used, and the two runes B and D were used on BS and pest, this creating death runes.<br>

</div>Yeah. That's the way those macros work. There is an explanation somewhere in this thread if you're really interested why. Basically it's because /cancelaura isn't affected by GCD but Blood Tap/Bone Shield are so when you're spamming it you'll cancel the aura before you can cast BS.<br>
<br>
It was solved with 2 macros. I guess you can make it with 1 but then you can't spam the macro and must wait for the GCD.<br>

</div>This is an issue I posted about a long while back for DW frost as well.<br>
<br>
DW frost has the same issue with Unbreakable Armor and Blood of the North.<br>
<br>
The best way to do this is as follow:<br>
<br>
1. Make these 2 macros:<br>
<br>
#showtooltip Bone Shield<br>
/cast Blood Tap<br>
/cast Bone Shield<br>
<br>
#showtooltip Blood Strike<br>
/cancelaura Blood Tap<br>
/cast Blood Strike<br>
/startattack <br>
<br>
(the last line is just so that i start auto attackign something in case the rune is on CD, its an old habit of me)<br>
<br>
Now let me explain why you do it this way.<br>
<br>
You can use the Bone Shield macro in 2 situations:<br>
- Either at the end of FUFUBB; in this case you DO NOT want to cancel the blood tap aura though, after all you want 2x death runes (a blood tapped rune stays deathrune for 20 seconds btw).<br>
- Or at the end of FUFUDD; in this case you do want the blood rune to go back to blood, because otherwise it gives you some trouble later on. (The buff will run out at the wrong time giving you a blood + death rune)<br>
<br>
So the way i dealt with it is to simply put the cancelaura to blood strike, that way you always blood strike on blood runes and not deathrunes. And you keep your death rune if you are going to use 2 of them for a scourge strike.<br>
<br>
I'm not 100% sure this still works as it should with reaping. But i've used this methode in patch 3.2.2 as well, since it's pretty solid and covers all unwanted scenarios. So I'm pretty sure it will. <br>
And i always refresh after all my runes are on cooldown, things really get messed up if you use the bone shield macro when there are other runes up sometimes.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Based on the latest EAP values, the sheer increase in ArP value pushes both Deathbringer's Will over even Heroic Death's Verdict, even if haste (a very much worthless stat now) procs.  While I am adamant in my belief that DW is on a 105s CD based on numerous 3rd party trials, I am still uncertain of the proc selection, however according to a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100310014526/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=50362#comments:id=912531" target="_blank"><font color="Blue">recent post</font></a> (as of the time of writing this) on Wowhead, players are finding that the procs vary based on their current spec.  While Unholy, the trinket is proc'ing STR/Crit/Haste and while Blood it procs STR/Crit/ArP.  This information, while furthering the probability that the three proc types are hard-coded by Bliz based on your spec, is still not conclusive.  In the mean-time, as of 12/10 and until more concise stat weights emerge, accept with a grain of salt that both DW are currently BiS trinkets.  This also assumes that you can receive and benefit from both procs of DW and DW(H) within one ICD.  Otherwise, currently, Crystal Fanged Skull(H) becomes the second BiS trinket.<br>
<br>
I will leave below an equation, rather than my math, for calculating the value of DW.  It is up to you to stay up to date on stat weights and apply them.  I hope this will allow people to stay more up to speed with their trinket selection.<br>
<br>
600*(Str EAP+Crit EAP+Haste EAP)/3*(30s/105s) + 155*ArP EAP = SCORE<br>
<br>
For comparion, DV is simply:<br>
<br>
450*Str EAP*(30s/90s) + 256*AP EAP = SCORE<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1484979"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->One other point to consider when comparing GoD with GoDD is that the GoDD rotation doesn't require 2/2 Epidemic-- in fact, as I quickly discovered back on the PTR, the second point is wasted since the final tick is clipped. 2/2 is necessary for the GoD rotation, but you get the same number of disease ticks per 20-second rotation since you have to refresh before it falls off-- the total disease damage remains the same. So, with GoD you need 2/2 Epidemic to sustain it and can only afford 2/3 Morbidity, but with GoDD you can use 1/2 Epidemic and 3/3 Morbidity. The damage difference in DC between the two glyphs/specs is then slightly higher.<br>
<br>
I did napkin math on a WoL parse from last night (Deathbringer Saurfang, I stayed on the boss the majority of the time) and roughly calculated that the potential gain from having used GoD rotation/spec there (~75 dps) was outweighed by the potential damage loss to DC (~170 dps), at least for a single target situation. While this is only napkin math from one parse based on average damage of the appropriate abilities, I think taking the correct spec into account in the comparison will find GoDD and GoD closer than is being estimated by some.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1485016"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The total disease damage does not remain the same, as BP is then being applied without RoR. As well, if you are the sole provider of EP in your raid, the damage from that dropping is much too high to even attempt to calculate.<br>
<br>
On Saurfang you would want to use GoD whether or not you would normally, so that's a poor fight to try and make your argument! That said, GoD gives more than a 75 dps gain - far more. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100310014526/http://www.wowmeteronline.com/combat/detail/276930174#damageout" target="_blank">My Saurfang</a> from last night, in which I didn't even use GoD optimally or perform well in general. With an average SS of 12125, an average BS of 3715, an average PS of 3796, and an average IT of 2144 equates to a 2470/20 = 123 dps gain from GoD right there. Factor in the increased disease damage that it provides, and it goes much higher - GoD increases one's average disease damage by about 10%, usually. By contrast, if I had used GoDD + a point of Necrosis (better than Morbidity) I would have gained 2.2% dps, or 210 dps... at the cost of however much disease damage I gained from GoD as well as the cost of my BP never benefitting from RoR. <br>
<br>
Even being generous in the disease damage numbers, napkin math would support GoD, not GoDD.<br>
<br>
Besides, one of the strengths of GoD is how well it scales (since it's scaling is heavily tied in with that of SS). GoDD simply doesn't scale near as well, especially since DC becomes a smaller portion of our DPS as we progress through ICC (while SS becomes larger).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Short version: Using my previously linked parse (simply because I'm too lazy to drudge up another one), my average DC was 5818 (+ UB = 6400). Dirge gives 2.5 RP per SS per 20 seconds per talent point, or a total of 12.5 RP (31.25% of a DC) per 20 seconds. That's 6400 x .3125 = 2000 damage per 20 seconds, or 100 DPS per talent point. That's more than Necrosis (which typically gives about ~.7% more dps per point on a single target, which is obviously less).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1485162"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Glyph of Disease currently does not refresh diseases with the benefit from Rage of Rivendare.  To gain the benefit from RoR, diseases must be applied manually while Blood Plague is on the target.  Once diseases are applied with the benefit from RoR, they can be rolled with GoD and still retain the benefit.<br>
<br>
Another note of interest, if your diseases on your primary target have the benefit of RoR and are passed to secondary targets via Pestilence, the diseases on the secondary targets do not retain the benefit of RoR.  If diseases are still active on the secondary targets and are passed again using Pestilence, they will gain the benefit of RoR.<br>
<br>
This leads us back into unfortunate contortions for maximizing disease damage.  Perhaps this would be a good alternative method for opening?<br>

Firstly, am I correct in thinking that diseases no longer "roll", as it were, so I don't have to worry about my AP when initially applying diseases?<br>
<br>
Secondly, I'm having trouble with the GoD rotation, as whenever I go to Pestilence, my diseases always have &lt;1 second left on their duration, meaning that any variation (Movement, CCs, etc) in a fight mean that my diseases drop off. Is this an issue, DPS-wise, or do I just go back to the initial rotation and start again?<br>

<br>
Second I would like to discuss the attack rotations and my experiences with them.<br>
<br>
Using Considers recommended 17/0/54 build, and staying in BP, I have set each attack rotation "stage" in seperate castsequence macros. I will hit the frist macro 7 times, the second 6 (assuming there is enough RP for DC), and the third 6. If I "spam" these macros to ensure the fastest timing possible I still get to Pestilence with &lt;1 second to spare on Frost Fever.<br>
<br>
While sparring on a dummy, pestilence is easily met in time to recast FF, but while in a raid, pvp, ect... it seems difficult to pop Pestilence within the short amount of time needed. <br>
<br>
Is there any way to rearrange the second stage to include pestilence near the end of the rotation, or to place it sooner in the third attack stage? Theoretically I'd like to leave a buffer time to ensure maximum dps from Frost Fever, as we are using Glyph of IT.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1485473"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I've found that switching BS and Pest around in the third part of the rotation (3rd part of your starting rotation, 2nd part of the rotation you repeat) will generally give you enough time to refresh your diseases. Seems like a simple solution, but it does stop them falling off. So the rotation is as follows<br>

		<div id="post_message_1485481"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->That's an interesting issue with the functionality of pestilence.   I wonder if its happening without GoD as well. I presume it no longer clones the diseases to the secondary targets but puts up new ones with your current stats.  The single target behaviour seems a little bit odd, as I just assumed it would in essence reapply the diseases.  <br>
<br>
In terms of an initial rotation it probably makes sense to go<br>
<br>
IT PS SS BS BS<br>
IT PS SS xx SS<br>
xx SS SS BS Pest<br>
<br>
And just accept that the first 10 seconds will be with lower diseases.<br>

</div>True, I hadn't considered the effect of Rage of Rivendare (although, apparently there isn't one in that instance). I also didn't think of Necrosis, which would indeed be the better point allocation vs. a third Morbidity point or second Epidemic (clipping for 10% more BP dmg).<br>
<br>
I chose Deathbringer Saurfang since it was an encounter where I was pretty consistently on the target, only switching off occasionally to dps down a high health add. I didn't consider it an AOE encounter for Glyph of Disease because of the significant penalty to AOE and disease damage on the adds.<br>
<br>
My point was simply to note that comparisons between the glyphs should take more favorable specs into consideration. Obviously neither of our parses are conclusive (my average PS and IT did nearly 1k more damage than yours, so the difference between the average SS and BS+PS+IT was a bit closer, for one) and I wasn't trying to argue that one glyph is always better-- I prefer to use them situationally.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I'm using Bone Shield at the end of UFUFBB or UFUFDD like most of us I guess. How to do it with macros is explained on previous page.<br>
<br>
I'm still using Rune Strike macroed to my melee abilities. It's 20RP vs 40RP for DC and does considerably more damage so even if you lose 1 DC from the rotation it's not a damage loss and it wont screw up your rotation.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1485621"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Okay using my spreadsheet for comparing glyphs and talents and assuming you PS before IT, then only one point in epidemic is about a 60 dps loss from no RoR on BP, but with 4T9 it's about an 80 dps loss, and that's assuming you don't make any specials in the 2 seconds before your PS.<br>
The extra point in morbidity is worth about 50 dps at 9 DCs per minute. (ignoring the DnD boost).  <br>
Finally for reference a point in necrosis is worth about 70 dps (in the ToC unholy gear set).<br>
<br>
Which supports Consider's conclusions.<br>
It would be possible to keep up ebon plague with such a rotation, if you split the diseases.  Such a rotation has a few benefits, you can use your Death runes for putting up the diseases, and if you set it correctly and have 5-15 seconds between when you apply diseases you'd have quite a bit (up to 5/4 times the normal) uptime on the 2T9 bonus.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Are you positive that the combat log is actually agreeing with what you are seeing ingame? I've noticed various mods are not yet prepared to handle the new scourge strike. Certainly there could be a bug, but it would be good to get some combat log evidence to rule out the possiblilty it is a faulty mod reporting the numbers. <br>
<br>
I'll make sure to submit my loggerhead log to my raid leader tonight, just to see if I can find some evidence to support this bug. if someone else could do the same it would be nice, so we have multiple points of data to make a determination on the issue.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>If there aren't any diseases on the target, SS doesn't do any shadow damage (that part of the spell doesn't even happen). Lowest crit on SS I had was 5k-6kish with no procs up, going as high as 15k crits as the fight progressed (talking about shadow part of SS). The behavior you are describing is something I have experienced myself, and considering the nature of new SS it feels correct (yet strange). Don't forget there is a crit multiplier on SS (+30% from Vicious Strikes) and that currently shadow SS is doubledipping from all benefitial modifiers (I recall reading this when GC was describing how new SS is supposed to work) while it doesn't doubledip from negative modifiers (specificaly resilience).<br>
<br>
On another note, I have been lucky enough to pick up <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100308083604/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=50709" target="_blank">[Bryntroll, the Bone Arbiter]</a> tonight, and I must say that I am very impressed by the proc of the weapon. During a course of heroic dungeon (HoL), I have used 67 Death coils, and the axe procced 65 times, accounting for 4.9% of my overall damage. On a single target fight like Sarufang I have seen number as high as 7.5%. <br>
The proc deffinately scales with stats and debuffs, because average hit of the ability was 3000. Sadly enough, the proc doesn't crit, but I believe it deffinately makes up for faster-than-average weapon speed and lack of stats on the weapon.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">The new scourge strike appears to behaves like necrosis when it comes to val'kyr twins and empowered darkness/light. This can lead to some very <i>interesting</i> double crits. Recount shows my max scourge strike was a whopping 111,213 damage, and due to the way recount records the damage that's ONLY counting the shadow part of the damage, so the actual number from that 1 attack was probably closer to 130,000.

		<div id="post_message_1486084"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->It's not really a decision between the two so much as "Use GoD unless you are rather undergeared (which is increasingly difficult to be with gear being increasingly accessible) or have latency issues, in which cases use GoDD". Aside from that, GoD just seems superior in every way, even when you consider the specific nature of the individual ICC encounters.<br>
<br>
Anyways, as such, I'm not quite sure I agree it deserves to be presented as a viable alternative and a matter of preference/playstyle. I will gladly add a subsection for its use, but only while stating that it is suboptimal unless you fit in the two aforementioned scenarios.<br>
<br>
In other news, preliminary BiS list generated (thanks to Bjados), although very preliminary - it doesn't include Arthas loot (as it's still unknown), and it will change in other areas, potentially, for various reasons. I'm working on new stat weights for various gear levels, which should be as accurate as can be generated. Once those are out, a more perfect BiS list should be able to be found, although I wouldn't expect any huge differences.<br>
<br>
On another note, the dps difference between the current gear level and absolute BiS is just ridiculous. We'll scale more in this tier then we have during the past two combined.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

It's understandable, tho. I was on 16.7k dps on Twins HM without getting a single SS crit during Empowered Darkness (my best hit was actually higher than my best crit, 49k vs 48k) and that raised some eyebrows. Heck, I had almost 15k on normal without a single Empowered buff.<br>
<br>
While UH dps seems excessively high at the moment, I don't see Rogues having anything to complain about, as they were leap and bounds ahead of other pures that would have easily beated them last week. Our best rogue topped mages on Jaraxxus. <br>
<br>
What I found more interesting is that the loss of 4p9 didn't really affect me on AoE - I still managed to break 16k on Champs during the initial disease spread, which sort of surprised me.<br>
<br>
I still feel the standard rotation has some edges to smooth - like the RoR issue. However at the moment I wonder if it's worth even trying to touch the 5 SS per 20 second formula. My experience last night and a brief tour of WoL shows SS being 30% of our dps and upwards - it was 39% on Twins.<br>
<br>
A last random thought (I'm not very productive today) is that SS feels incredibly random. It can hit anywhere between 6 and 20k, which is sort of similar to what happens with OB for Frost at the moment - however the different crit chance and scaling of the shadow part, and the interaction with the other buffs put from raidmembers make it feel even more unpredictable.<br>
<br>
Last thing I'd like to mention is Unholy Blight. If you check your logs and WoL, it seems to me that it's definitely less than a 1% dps increase per talent point - it's bloody hitting around 50 for me. If we need to find points to move elsewhere, it looks like a major candidate.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1486094"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Of course, but there isn't any point in speculating. It is what it is right now, and there has been no actual sign (simply common sense and logic) to indicate anything will change. Don't worry though. I'll be thrilled when I come home one day, open up MMO-Champion, and find I have to redo the entire front page again.<br>
<br>
Speaking of 4P T9, from what I could calculate, it will <i>not</i> be used in "AoE" BiS. It's still incredibly potent, of course, but so is 4P T10, and the greater stats push things over.<br>
<br>
On another note, as my mind is going in many different directions at the moment, crit (almost) overtakes strength in BiS. It becomes very, very close. Unlike ArP (which, yes, does overtake Str, as previously discussed, but by such a slight amount, I still can't see it being worth the multiple target loss), crit is a different color, and crit benefits AoE. As such, it will change gemming a lot. <br>
<br>
As well, agility similarly grows in strength - breaking the magical 2.0 number. <br>
<br>
This likely means the recently posted BiS list will shift a moderate amount, although the current list should give people a rough idea if they're looking ahead.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1486107"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Weights in generalized gear, for some thought below. Everything is logical enough when you look at previous weights, factor in increased disease ticks (from GoD), 25% more Scourge Strikes (from GoD), Scourge Strike's ridiculous scaling with Crit and ArP, and ArP's ridiculous scaling with itself. I'm rather exhausted at the moment, but I'll toss these in the OP (and make the appropriate changes in other areas of the thread) tomorrow, and try and get a new BiS list to throw up as well. I should also have the set bonus weights available, although how those shift should be predictable enough.<br>
<br>
Assuming, of course, there isn't anything blatantly wrong about them which I'm missing. Part of the reason why I'm going to sleep instead of immediately throwing them into the OP right now is specifically to let people chew on them for half a day to see for errors. I don't expect them to find any, but I'm certainly not perfect, and it is late. The variations in stats all make sense with the various gear levels, set bonuses, and the introduction of GoD instead of GoDD.<br>

Edit: Just to be clear, the previous stat weights which are still in the OP <i>were accurate at their time</i>. Those were done pre-GoD, which changes things a lot (more than many realize), and weren't particularly differentiated in terms of gear, just set bonuses, due to the underestimation of scaling.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

On another note, as my mind is going in many different directions at the moment, crit (almost) overtakes strength in BiS. It becomes very, very close. Unlike ArP (which, yes, does overtake Str, as previously discussed, but by such a slight amount, I still can't see it being worth the multiple target loss), crit is a different color, and crit benefits AoE. As such, it will change gemming a lot. </div>

</div>This sounds shocking considering it breaks one of the few rules about DKs that survived all incarnations of the class, but I'm not surprised; last night mashing on the totem pole I kept thinking "I need more crit because the shadow part isn't critting nearly enough". You really feel the dps skyrocketing with crits now.<br>
<br>
As an unrelated note, is there any combat text addon out there that manages to merge the 2 hits from SS? Parrot merges them when both crits, but it keeps individual hits and crits separate.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Weights in generalized gear, for some thought below. Everything is logical enough when you look at previous weights, factor in increased disease ticks (from GoD), 25% more Scourge Strikes (from GoD), Scourge Strike's ridiculous scaling with Crit and ArP, and ArP's ridiculous scaling with itself. I'm rather exhausted at the moment, but I'll toss these in the OP (and make the appropriate changes in other areas of the thread) tomorrow, and try and get a new BiS list to throw up as well. I should also have the set bonus weights available, although how those shift should be predictable enough.</div>

</div>Ironic how as usual to make "arp attractive to UH too" they made it a godstat.<br>
<br>
Looking at those numbers, I wouldn't regem to ArP since the difference is too thin and overall probably a loss once you factor AoE, but still it's a shocking change. In a way, it's also the perfect balance - once you consider ArP is going, probably the ideal situation is it giving a tiny edge on single target to compensate the aoe loss.<br>
<br>
I'm suprised to see Haste so low, but I'm confident that it's also due to us dropping Necrosis.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Ugh, please don't lump me in with people making some BS argument about "playstyle". When I say "I prefer to use it situationally", I'm talking about making a decision as to whether I'd be able to use GoD optimally in a given encounter. GoD is an unusual glyph in that if it can't be used to its potential (frequent target-switching, disrupted rotations, avoiding CC though that doesn't seem to ever be an issue anymore), it can become an empty glyph slot. To me, this makes it a choice based on what I need to do in a fight.<br>
<br>
GoD will clearly get better as gear and especially weapons get better in ICC, there's no debate-- the extra SS will more heavily outweigh the alternatives.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Short version: Using my previously linked parse (simply because I'm too lazy to drudge up another one), my average DC was 5818 (+ UB = 6400). Dirge gives 2.5 RP per SS per 20 seconds per talent point, or a total of 12.5 RP (31.25% of a DC) per 20 seconds. That's 6400 x .3125 = 2000 damage per 20 seconds, or 100 DPS per talent point. That's more than Necrosis (which typically gives about ~.7% more dps per point on a single target, which is obviously less).</div>

</div>My experience tells me the opposite.<br>
<br>
I used to play as Frost DW with a Subversion build since didn't need me to apply IIT, and thus playing with a GoD rotation. The playstyle is very similar to UH's current rotation, but the problems you refer to were extremely prominent - I was often tempted of going UP to be able to dump all that RP.<br>
<br>
In the current UH rotation, I've yet to stumble into the problem. The rotation is much smoother, RP generation is lower (but we need to factor the GoIT change) and landing Pests is fairly simple - sometimes you'll have to use the first Blood rune coming, but that's about it. And every 3 rotations I came to a point where I had everything on cd and not enough RP for a Deathcoil.<br>
<br>
What is undoubtely true is that Necrosis is a passive effect; as such, if you're on learning progress and you're forced to focus on fight mechanics more than pulling off the perfect rotation, then Necrosis could have an edge on Dirge.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1486458"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->We have plenty of free GCDs. Using every DC we can is not difficult, not in the slightest. You just have to know when and when not to use them, and when diseases need to be refreshed would be one of the latter situations.<br>
<br>
Awareness does surpass Virulence, but only if you actively gem ArP and are in BiS, and even then they still come within ~10 dps of one another, with Awareness just barely edging out. <br>
<br>
Having two sets is, of course, ideal, but it's not that simple. One can't snap their fingers and magically have two of each item. Although, over time, one will get various pieces which they can swap in and out, it does take a lot of time, generally speaking, and at the end of the day there are some items which you'll never get a second of. Besides, you're going to have to prioritize one set or the other. The lead ArP has on a single target isn't all that potent, and just doesn't outweigh Str's performance whenever there is AoE - incidental or otherwise - which is still the case with most bosses.<br>
<br>
But, yes, given unlimited gear, two sets is easiest. There is a point in time, however, where you have to stop with theory and look at reality.<br>

</div>The problem with the standard GoD rotation is that Blood Plague will not get the benefit of Rage of Rivendare (and if you open with Icy Touch, neither will Frost Fever).  Your diseases only gain the benefit of RoR if you apply them on a target already affected by Blood Plague.  (This doesn't have to be your BP, however).  Once your diseases have the benefit from RoR, you can roll them with Pestilence and they will retain that buff (though they will still adjust to any changes in your AP or Crit).  <br>
<br>
(This behavior is similar to Shadow Priests with Shadow Word: Pain, where refreshing SWP will adjust the value of the ticks to their new spellpower and crit values but will not cause SWP to gain the benefit from increased stacks of Shadow Weaving or Scorch.)<br>
<br>
I ran the numbers on some parses from last night, and the loss of RoR from Blood Plague is about 65 DPS (this with 4pT9).  The rotation I listed in my post above will get both diseases rolling with the benefit of RoR in the first rotation and shouldn't cost any Scourge Strikes, but has the downside of being awkward and somewhat difficult to re-create if diseases fall off.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">A late quote, I'm sorry for it.<br>
Regarding dirge vs necrosis with GoD.<br>
<br>
Since the GoD timing is tricky, we may not be able to use every DC we can, not to loose the diseases on the target.<br>
That not mesurable with sims and that's the matter.<br>
<br>
Considering that point, maybe necrosis could be better ?</div>

</div>GoD timing is not tricky at all, it just forces you to be on your toes and think and takes some getting used to.

</div>So the issue would appear to be that when you use GoD to reapply diseases it takes a new snapshot of your AP but for some reason it "saves" whether or not the diseases already on the target are getting the benefit of RoR, rather than adding that benefit (as it logically should) because you are reapplying diseases with BP already on the target (activating RoR). <br>
<br>
This would mean that your initial BP, since it started RoR, but did not get the benfit of it, will be reapplied without RoR's damage if you use GoD. If you use PS to reapply it whilte BP is still on the target, though, that new BP gets the benefit of RoR and will maintain it from then out with GoD, as long as it doesn't drop off the target.<br>
<br>
I haven't played with it yet, so don't take my word as fact, but hopefully this helps you understand what they are saying.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1486619"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Hi everyone,<br>
<br>
I have two questions/concerns about what the OP suggests in terms of Optimal spec.<br>
<br>
Here's a log of my fight against Saurfang yesterday :<br>
<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100305135838/http://www.worldoflogs.com/reports/rt-nec4oq1hsq8ou8ss/details/2/?s=7580&amp;e=7912" target="_blank">World of Logs - Real Time Raid Analysis</a><br>
<br>
I was using the recommended 17/0/54 spec with Glyphs : Dark Death/Ghoul/Pestilence.<br>
However, I stopped using Pestilence to refresh diseases after a while because I took aggro on the blood beasts (hence, my high number of PS/IT).<br>
<br>
First question : <br>
Death Coil is 12.2% of my total damage, and Frost Fever is only 6.3%. Even if I clipped the diseases a little due to not using Pestilence to refresh them, I don't understand how gaining 20% damage to FF (GoIT) could be superior to gaining 15% damage to Death Coil (GoDD).<br>
Another DK in my guild (Husnan, you can check his parse on the same WoL page) was using GoIT, GoDD, and Glyph of the Ghoul, and his Death Coils were 12.8% of his damage, while Frost Fever is only 6.9%.<br>
<br>
My second Question is about Necrosis :<br>
Looking at my parse on Saurfang, and even though I was using GoDD and very little ArP, my melee damage is 22.5% of my total damage, and Death Coil only 12.2%. How can Morbidity (+5% damage to DC per talent point) be better than Necrosis (+4% damage to Melee per talent point)?<br>
Or is the recommended spec including 2/3 Morbidity to ease AOE rotations with a lower DnD cooldown?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<!-- message -->
		<div id="post_message_1486661"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->GoIT also affects approximately half of your Wandering Plague damage. The two glyphs are almost exactly the same on a single target, and as such using a single parse to try to argue one or the other doesn't quite work, as getting even one extra DC crit or having FF fall off for even 5% of the fight can skew things one way or the other. The other parse you mention proves this point - he used GoDD but only did 5% more DC damage. When things are essentially equal, you can't really use individual parses to much effect.<br>
<br>
With them being near equal, GoIT is taken as it gains dps when you can pestilence to adds.<br>
<br>
As to Morbidity, that was brought up a couple pages back. Yes, it's due to the DnD reduction, which is essential for fights where you use DnD. For those who run two specs/swap specs, a single target spec with Necrosis instead is slightly more optimal. I'll probably mess with the OP some to decide how to phrase the issue. Don't think it's worth listing another whole spec when all* that shifts is Morbidity to Necrosis, and that's it. Yet relegating it to the optional talents section doesn't quite seem right, as it's not like GF/IUP (which <b>are</b> flat out inferior to everything else). <br>
<br>
*While on the subject, BA overcomes Necrosis even on a single target, for the curious. In ICC, that is.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Considering that ARP scales with the more you have. Is there any way to factor that in to EP values seeing as it surely not a constant. For someone who has lower ARP within their gear, the EP values would assumably be lower. Likewise someone who is able to pick up gear that incurs more ARP the value would seemingly increase. Not sure how this could be factored and a constant value still seems like only way to deal with it.<br>
<br>
I was just curious if the EP value of 3.01 is considering 100% ARP or considering a starting value of 0%.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1486737"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->It's not just ArP which ArP scales with. It's also weapon dps and strength/AP. Although a chart which shows ArP being worth X at Y value of ArP, Z value of weapon dps, and Q value of strength/AP would be amazing, it would also be amazingly difficult and time intensive to generate, if possible to do at all.<br>
<br>
I do recognize the issue, but it's not one with an easy solution, unfortunately. It's not one with a moderately difficult solution, for that matter. The best I could do for the time being is have the stat weights by tier, but the main problems lies in the fact that ArP's growth spurt occurs almost completely in ICC. I'm not really sure what I can do about it. If anyone has a potential fix, I would love to hear it. Most frustrating &gt;&lt;.<br>
<br>
The ilvl 264/277 stat weights were generated using an ilvl 264/277 set - which means it had about 800 ArP. I forget off the top of my head what percent that is, but neither 0% or 100%.<br>
<br>
Edit: Also, on a completely different note, after some playing with numbers and such, I think the sim got the spell hit values right, it simply made them negative instead of positive.<br>
<br>
Edit 2: To the below, since I'm about to run out the door and don't have time for a full post: 277 weapon (325 dps), ~2600 str, ~800 ArP, ~1250 CritR. Hit/Exp caps (alliance). Next to no haste. T10 bonuses. So on. I can post the specifics when I get back, although that should give a rough picture. The ilvl 245/258 set was simply 3.3 BiS from TotC - ~2200 str, ~350 ArP, 285 dps weapon, and such.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">The blood tap buff should remain up and keep that rune as a death rune, so you should still be able to SS.<br>

Haven't tested in game though, and I have seen blood tap behave oddly before, so can't confirm for sure.</div>

</div>Agreed, the rotation I listed above doesn't work.  That's my fault, I made a mistake on BT mechanics, and I've edited my previous posts to avoid confusion.<br>
<br>
This may just need to be a hit that GoD builds take on Blood Plague.  The way SS scales, the extra SS you get out of GoD has to out-weigh the small DPS loss from lowered BP damage (and keep in mind that my 65 DPS figure is with 4pT9).  However, it does mean that we should open with Plague Strike instead of Icy Touch, even if starting at range.  <br>
<br>
Of course, all this is meaningless if you can get another DK to put Blood Plague up before you do.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I do recognize the issue, but it's not one with an easy solution, unfortunately. It's not one with a moderately difficult solution, for that matter. The best I could do for the time being is have the stat weights by tier, but the main problems lies in the fact that ArP's growth spurt occurs almost completely in ICC. I'm not really sure what I can do about it. If anyone has a potential fix, I would love to hear it. Most frustrating &gt;&lt;.</div>

</div>ArP is not a linearly scaling stat, but due to AoE being everywhere (seems worth using on Sarfang even with the 70% damage nerf) you would never want to gem it.  However, you do want to pick it up naturally with gear, so just listing that caveat should satisfy that issue.<br>
<br>
Regarding ArP, 1 ArPen Rating ~= .07% Armor Reduced, so that is 57% armor ignoring (1401 is the hard cap).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1486960"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Forgive me if this has already been answered, but I am considering how to gear myself and I am trying to take your "set bonuses" information from the first post and apply it to my build.<br>
<br>
<i>These are the average weights of the set bonuses for Unholy DKs. As you can see, T10 is absolutely incredible for Unholy (and Blood/Frost, for that matter), and the sooner you can attain it, the better. Both bonuses are very strong, and worth successors to the ridiculousness of 3.2.2 4P T9.<br>
<br>
Set Bonus  <br>
Weight <br>
2T7	 329.23<br>
4T7	 355.38<br>
2T8	 89.23<br>
4T8	 663.08<br>
2T9	 86.15<br>
4T9	 495.38<br>
2T10	 507.69<br>
4T10	 470.77<br>
</i><br>
<br>
Statement 1:<br>
I do not have enough dkp to get the trophies, so I am stuck gearing towards the 232 tier 9 set.  I have enough triumph badges to get the set though.<br>
<br>
I am bewildered at how much of a dps increase from 2t9 to 4t9 is.<br>
#1 question - Did you already remove the crit chance to Icy Touch from your calculations (if you have, a small note in the main thread might help?)<br>
#2 question - Does that mean I should replace my 245 Legplates of Ascension and my 245 Frostforged Helm with the other two 232 pieces in order to get that 400+ dps increase? (We can assume I am hit capped)  I was doing calculations on comparing these 245 pieces to the 232 pieces and the dps loss in stats does not add up to over 400... so you are saying it would be a dps increase to go for the four piece bonus..... right?<br>
<br>
#3 question - Is that tier 9 bonus based on the 232 gear, the 245 gear, or the 258 gear?<br>
<br>
For what it's worth here is my armory currently today:<br>

So following up on our posts from before - there still is a delay (I have to wait for CD) in the above rotation and it really puts a damper on the DPS. I am pinpointing it now. Let me look...<br>
<br>
<b>(snippped for brevity)</b><br>
<br>
I'll post more or answer any questions for sure. I am just trying to adopt the most efficient DPS rotation for my spec and figure you might be able to spot some holes. <br>
<br>
On a side note - Pestilence always gets cut SO close in the current rotation. It WILL fall off in the current rotation if you make any mistake or delay (literally).</div>

	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>There should be a free GCD immediately after HoW and no other major gaps. Remember that the interface has never been good at displaying rune ability cooldowns (so don't wait for the interface) and that you are mixing melee GCDs with spell GCDs. Those two factors together can make it seem like there are significant gaps, but there is no design flaw in that rotation that unnecessarily increases its length.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">About the glyph of Disease clipping. I've always noticed a strange occurrence.<br>
In theory you only have 1 second left to refresh diseases with GoD, because diseases last 21 seconds, and a rotation takes 20 seconds.<br>
When I use glyph of diseases however I often notice that I have more than 1 second remaining on diseases when I use pestilence (usually about 2). I don't use GoD that often, so it might just be an odd occurrence. But I noticed that last week when I was tanking ToC (Didn't change my glyphs and normally I have a pvp spec as 2nd spec, which includes GoD).<br>
<br>
Maybe it's the rune cushioning acting weird, although that shouldn't keep happening.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>That is supposed to happen in theory. Remember that GoD resets the number of ticks on the disease to its maximum without altering the timing of the disease ticks, so when a glyphed Pestilence refreshes a disease, the disease's "duration" is "reset" to between just over 21 sec and just below 24 sec (assuming 2/2 Epidemic). Since diseases are on 3-sec cycles and the rotation is on a 20-sec cycle, your Pestilence refresh time fluctuates on a 60-sec cycle. The two diseases are on separate cycles, so in practice you are usually on the short end of the refresh leeway for at least one disease on any given Pestilence refresh. Of course, there are a number of ways to manipulate the tick timing further (for example, tabbing to a secondary target and infect your primary target with Pestilenced ticks; all of these things also have consequences on WP, of course).<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Okay using my spreadsheet for comparing glyphs and talents and assuming you PS before IT, then only one point in epidemic is about a 60 dps loss from no RoR on BP, but with 4T9 it's about an 80 dps loss, and that's assuming you don't make any specials in the 2 seconds before your PS.<br>
The extra point in morbidity is worth about 50 dps at 9 DCs per minute. (ignoring the DnD boost).  <br>
Finally for reference a point in necrosis is worth about 70 dps (in the ToC unholy gear set).</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Where does your spreadsheet put the last point in Morbidity for AE purposes?<br>
<br>
Some pages back somebody concluded that the last point in Morbidity was pointless for AE purposes based on Kahorie's sim putting 20-sec AE rotations slightly ahead of 15-sec AE rotations. My own calculations has always put 15-sec AE rotations substantially ahead of 20-sec AE rotations. I didn't get a chance to look into the discrepancy until recently when I was doing rotation tests on DnD/2pT10-based Frost and Unholy tanking specs I was experimenting with for 3.3.<br>
<br>
Realistically, the average rotation length for 3/3 Morbidity DnD rotations is around 15.25 sec, targetting click and all. However, Kahorie's sim rates 3/3 Morbidity DnD rotations at ~16.75+ sec. This is not like the 3.2 Reaping issue where the sim is a couple hundred miliseconds off and you eventually graduate to Reapingless anyway when you get near BiS haste. Kahorie's sim is 15 to 17.5+ hundred miliseconds off here. To make it worse, the increased rotation length also happens to turn very favorable disease refreshes for the 3/3 Morbidity DnD rotations into unfavorable ones.<br>
<br>
It's hard to justify dropping a point in Morbidity When you weigh the substantial sustained AE DPS loss against the wee single-target DPS gain.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1487228"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I have a several questions regarding rotations and gcds. Obviously 3.2 made unholy fairly simple to play. Prior to that the only version of unholy I played was the multiple dw it spam builds (32/39 20/51). So the rotation was always up as in there was rarely any waiting for runes. With the current setup I seem to have some time at various parts where I"m basically just waiting for runes to come up, I'm wondering if this is a normal occurrence for this build or if I'm doing something incorrectly. On that subject.  I have around 100ms typically during raids. It's literally impossible for me to do the rotation in the OP as my disease fall off. The other issue is, I saw the post a few pages back that switched the pest from the 2nd half of the rotate from bs-&gt; pest to pest-&gt; bs. This works although still leaves me very little time to refresh, so if a mob moves for more than 1 second I'm basically screwed and have to start all over. I'm just concerned that I'm missing something that I shouldn't be.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">That is supposed to happen in theory. Remember that GoD resets the number of ticks on the disease to its maximum without altering the timing of the disease ticks, so when a glyphed Pestilence refreshes a disease, the disease's "duration" is "reset" to between just over 21 sec and just below 24 sec (assuming 2/2 Epidemic). Since diseases are on 3-sec cycles and the rotation is on a 20-sec cycle, your Pestilence refresh time fluctuates on a 60-sec cycle. The two diseases are on separate cycles, so in practice you are usually on the short end of the refresh leeway for at least one disease on any given Pestilence refresh. Of course, there are a number of ways to manipulate the tick timing further (for example, tabbing to a secondary target and infect your primary target with Pestilenced ticks; all of these things also have consequences on WP, of course).</div>

</div>Ah in that way. Well we just cleared ICC25 today with our guild.<br>
<br>
I use Forte Xcorsist for my DoT timers, which adjust the timers based on the dot ticks, so that might be why it seems there is still some time left.<br>
Had not much problem keeping Pestilence rolling on Saurfang, but obviously this is a tank and spank fight for melee. I think it dropped off once, but thats just something to take for granted and reapply your diseases. The RoR + GoD issue is a bit annoying though, because it means you have to refresh your diseases twice every time it falls off. (or at least plague strike)<br>
<br>
In a tough fight I assume it's better to just go with the non-GoD rotation (IT&gt;PS&gt;BS&gt;BS&gt;SS // SS&gt;SS&gt;SS), and possibly reglyph to GoDD.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1487251"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I have 200ms at best and the rotation is fine. Regardless of whether your opening rotation is PS/IT - BS - Pest - SS or PS/I - SS - BS - Pest, you need to use your 2 death runes from the BS+Pest <u>without delay</u> when they come up so that you have enough time left on diseases when they refresh again as 2 blood runes for the BS - Pest. A common mistake that may happen is that you dump deathcoils just before your death runes become ready and put yourself a gcd behind. <u>Only</u> dump deathcoils when you know you have no runes (even FU) coming off cooldown within the next 1.5s. The reason i say also for FU runes is that delaying your FU scourge strikes may delay when you finally land a scourge strike that uses the 2 death runes. Keep in mind dodges/misses on your scourge strikes may cause similar delay on rune consumption.<br>

		<!-- message -->
		<div id="post_message_1487282"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I have a few things to note here:<br>
<br>
Recount does not seem to show currently show Scourge Strike accurately. The highest I've crit (according to Recount) in 3.2.2 ToC gear is 12k, with the average being around 6k and the minimum being under 1k. Ingame scrolling text shows me hitting for double 12ks at times.<br>
<br>
But how people are seeing 49k NON-CRIT strikes blows my mind. I realize I'm geared a bit for haste and have little arpen to speak of, but I just can't see ~24k strikes turning into double that without something being very very wrong.<br>
<br>
As far as the rotation, I'm having the same trouble as everyone else. Well, sort of. Instead of trying to follow it religiously, I've gotten to a half-priority system:<br>
<br>
IT/PS to put up diseases<br>
BS to proc Desolation<br>
Pest to refresh/spread diseases with the Desolation buff attached<br>
SS as core damage, and in my case, to proc SoV<br>
DC to dump RP<br>
HoW to build RP/fill GCD time<br>
<br>
It gets to the point where I'm simply spamming SS/DC/HoW and having a hard time measuring when the next BS/Pest should be. The problem comes in when I'm coming toward a Pest refresh spot. There are three things that might happen for me:<br>
<br>
1. I used too many Death Runes on SS to be able to BS/Pest in time. Usually in this case I'll pop Blood Tap to squeeze a Pest in before the timer runs out, but it usually burns my BS out of the Pest.<br>
2. I was being careful and reapplied BS/Pest too early and clipped diseases/SS.<br>
3. My BS/Pest have gotten out of whack from popping one early and I'm refreshing them at odd times, sometimes clipping BS out of the Pest, as in #1.<br>
<br>
So my question is, when exactly should BS and Pest be reapplied? I see where they are in the rotation, but between mobile fights, switching targets and sometimes getting caught in other roles like CC, I find it hard to keep track of how many SS I've done since the last Pest, and such.<br>
<br>
Also, while we're on the subject, where can you fit Gargoyle into the rotation? Do you just skip out on a couple Death Coils before you use it? As far as I can tell the rotation never has two DC's in a row, so you'll have to plan it about 10 seconds early, correct?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1487305"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->So I did some more testing and I went and looked at the whole thing about dc when a FU is about to come up I came up with a slightly different rotation that seems to me at least be a bit smoother<br>
<br>
This is what I started with (The OP rot I ignored the opener as that won't change much, works either way)<br>
SS – DC – SS – SS – DC – (DC) SS – SS – BS – Pest – DC – HoW  \<br>
<br>
and I tried this.. the secondary deathcoil now becomes norm instead of the odd one out as it is pretty much the only spot in the rotation where I could find enough time and not compromise the quick usage of FU runes<br>
<br>
SS - SS -  SS -  DC - DC - SS - SS - Pest - BS - DC <br>
<br>
Now, I didn't do a whole lot of testing but, if I had an excessive amount of rp occasionally I had time to dump it at a point, it'd almost always be after the 2nd dc dump. This also sometimes means you can only do one in the 1st. Not sure if that has an adverse affect or not.<br>
<br>
If there's anything fundamentally wrong with this or I'm missing something let me know. The rotation just seemed to be more fluid this way. Off the top of my head I don't remember losing death coils in this variation but I might be wrong.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I have a few things to note here:<br>
<br>
Recount does not seem to show currently show Scourge Strike accurately. The highest I've crit (according to Recount) in 3.2.2 ToC gear is 12k, with the average being around 6k and the minimum being under 1k. Ingame scrolling text shows me hitting for double 12ks at times.<br>
<br>
But how people are seeing 49k NON-CRIT strikes blows my mind. I realize I'm geared a bit for haste and have little arpen to speak of, but I just can't see ~24k strikes turning into double that without something being very very wrong.<br>
<br>
As far as the rotation, I'm having the same trouble as everyone else. Well, sort of. Instead of trying to follow it religiously, I've gotten to a half-priority system:<br>
<br>
IT/PS to put up diseases<br>
BS to proc Desolation<br>
Pest to refresh/spread diseases with the Desolation buff attached<br>
SS as core damage, and in my case, to proc SoV<br>
DC to dump RP<br>
HoW to build RP/fill GCD time<br>
<br>
It gets to the point where I'm simply spamming SS/DC/HoW and having a hard time measuring when the next BS/Pest should be. The problem comes in when I'm coming toward a Pest refresh spot. There are three things that might happen for me:<br>
<br>
1. I used too many Death Runes on SS to be able to BS/Pest in time. Usually in this case I'll pop Blood Tap to squeeze a Pest in before the timer runs out, but it usually burns my BS out of the Pest.<br>
2. I was being careful and reapplied BS/Pest too early and clipped diseases/SS.<br>
3. My BS/Pest have gotten out of whack from popping one early and I'm refreshing them at odd times, sometimes clipping BS out of the Pest, as in #1.<br>
<br>
So my question is, when exactly should BS and Pest be reapplied? I see where they are in the rotation, but between mobile fights, switching targets and sometimes getting caught in other roles like CC, I find it hard to keep track of how many SS I've done since the last Pest, and such.<br>
<br>
Also, while we're on the subject, where can you fit Gargoyle into the rotation? Do you just skip out on a couple Death Coils before you use it? As far as I can tell the rotation never has two DC's in a row, so you'll have to plan it about 10 seconds early, correct?</div>

	</tbody></table>
</div>Recount only shows 1 part of SS. That 12k scourge strike is 12k shadow damage, what you don't see is the 5k physical damage that goes with it. So your highest SS was around 17-18k probably. <br>
<br>
Those very high SS crits are on Twins in ToC, because of the weird buff they give and as you know SS double dips from that. Say you do 200% damage when you get the buff, that means the physical part does twice as much and the shadow part does nearly 4 times as much (because of the buff on the physical part).<br>
<br>
As for the pestilence thing. It's actually really simple but you have to REALLY be on the ball. You have to use runes the millisecond they are available, or you will miss your pestilence mark.<br>
After you've done the initial rotation the best way to memorize when you need to PT is to simply say: Use all FU runes for SS, If you have a set of death runes coming up those are for SS too, if you have a set of blood runes coming up you have to Pestilence and blood strike.<br>
Basically you spam SS until you see your blood runes coming up, and then you have to get ready to spam pestilence.<br>
<br>
Deathcoils are used in the free GCD, if you use your runes as they are available then you should have plenty of GCD after you used your set. <br>
<br>
For gargoyle, it depends a bit on the fights. But I tend to pop a gargoyle after my first rotation, that usually gives me all trinket buffs up.<br>
After that I watch the timer, the moment it is available again I wait until my trinkets proc again (I generally want greatness, unholy strength and my sigil to be up), and then I use it. (They last 10+ seconds which is enough to get 60 RP).<br>
In the case of fight where we don't have BL at the start (On saurfang for example we pop BL at the start as that is the only moment when 100% of the dps is focused on the boss), I try to just leave gargoyle up until BL goes up, and then wait for trinkets and proc it. <br>
Empower Rune Weapon is a good ability to use when you need gargoyle asap as well.<br>
<br>
I tend to save blood tap for emergencies where i want an instant pestilence. Say for example on Marrowgar when he starts bonestorm in 5 seconds but I only just used my deathrunes on scourge strike.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1487378"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Refined BiS lists have been added. Nothing hugely surprising, when you consider the shift in weights. ArP is up to ~1100 (non Shadowmourne) and ~1200 (Shadowmourne) passive, for the curious. I'll run "absolute BiS" stat weights after my raid tonight, although I doubt much will change aside from ArP getting a bit stronger. Crit/agi are likely to plateau, as they do decrease in value with themselves (unlike ArP), although the increased level of gear will likely keep them from actually going down.<br>

As to the post asking about the set weights - those are only for the set bonuses. Not the pieces themselves. A 4P bonus weight does not include a 2P bonus weight, or any such thing.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Okay, so just to clarify a few things for posterity's sake:<br>
<br>
Recount is broken (for SS) until updated. But I did some looking and apparently "DrDamage" is updated already to show the proper SS numbers. I'm sure Recount will be updated soon, it can't be hard to make it look for "Scourge Strike hits for X Shadow" and then "Scourge Strike hits for X Physical".<br>
<br>
About the rotation, in simpler terms the rotation translates to:<br>
IT/PS to get your diseases up<br>
BS to get desolation up<br>
PT with deso buff<br>
SS when you have FU runes<br>
PT and BS as Blood runes are refreshing (Which comes first? I assume BS will be running out about the same time as diseases do, so is that refreshed before Pestilence?)<br>
DC whenever no runes are available<br>
<br>
Hopefully I got that right? Understanding why the rotation works makes it so much easier to actually do it, especially when a natural disaster happens where you have to move off target or chase it down or whatever.<br>
<br>
Re: Gargoyle - I have ERW, trinket, speed pot and gargoyle lined up on my bar... when I plan to use Garg I usually pop them in order. That means I only have to skip one DC, if any, which should be acceptable. Gargoyle benefits from AP and Haste, based on the OP, what about Crit/Arpen?<br>

</div>I originally just compared 3/3 Reaping 2/3 Morbidity 0/5 Necrosis to 0/3, 3/3, 2/5 in my current gear and got slightly higher results without Reaping. Loading in some ICC gear brought Reaping back into style. GoD, too! <br>
<br>
GoD only gets about 30~ dps higher than Dark Death in the very best ICC gear.<br>
<br>
<br>
I do get the highest DPS with 12/0/59. Necrosis seems to edge out Dark Conviction by about 10 dps.<br>

At any rate, so far, my findings are mirroring Daia, more or less. Expect a front post update tomorrow (or Saturday, pending work), as I figure how to frame some areas, and ensure all conclusions are completely accurate. That, and I'm not really in the mood to completely revamp the entire front page after having just done so, except this time nothing could be done in advance.<br>
<br>
That aside, not much else to say. Dps will still be ahead of what it was last patch, simply behind what it was for the past 24 hours, although the loss of dps is the least of my concerns regarding this change.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Hardly surprising though really, but even so I think there could have been better solutions. How could they have failed to see this on the ptr and catch it then if its so unacceptable? The above paste is from one fight with insane buff available (Which has always done similar on WP), I suppose 20k double crits on normal targets is still on the high side.<br>
<br>
Will have to wait and see where we stand after all is said and done!<br>

Voicing my support here for your thread Consider, as I can't do so on the US forums. Nobody will listen, but it should still be said.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1487691"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I really just hate that they keep switching this on us. I just blew a ton of DKP on armor pen boots from ICC25.<br>
<br>
Furthermore, have a look at T10 gear. Theres armor pen on almost everything. Does this mean Blood becomes the more attractive spec for most encounters?<br>
<br>
I'm thinking about setting up blood as my second spec and using it for single target fights and then swapping to unholy aoe spec/gear for aoe. <br>
<br>
Also, is there a chance that the shadow portion of SS isnt hitting at all? I'm decked out in close to BiS gear pre icc and my SS crits for 5.5k. Thats definitely JUST 60% weapon damage + (whatever the number is now), and not the included shadow damage. Does the shadow damage show up separate? or where would I find a parse for how much my actual ss shadow damage hits/crits for if indeed it is distinct?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Although one SS is certainly stronger than two BS, it's the opportunity cost of those three talent point which pushes Reaping out.<br>
<br>
In heavy ICC gear, Reaping and BA both pull ahead of Dark Conviction, and as such you just shift those points, making the build this <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100227100519/http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?deathknight#_CJEPD_c73rI7,HpF,10958" target="_blank">15/0/56</a>. However, GoD didn't quite catch up, still falling about 20 dps short. With Shadowmorne, it likely does win out, but short of that, GoDD seems to stay.<br>
<br>
I'll be working on stat weights next, and determining when exactly Reaping/BA become worth it or not. <br>

I've actually had higher DPS numbers using critical strike rating instead of STR as the highest value (BiS has 49% crit chance) and it amounts to a much higher loss than it is for STR SS's.<br>

The way SS worked crit rating was clearly above STR - and numbers would have proved my claim on the long run.<br>

<br>
not only are critical hits less than a normal hit, but the critical percentage is far below normal.  My normal percentage self buffed is right around 55% so i'm missing 25% somewhere.<br>
<br>
Can anyone else confirm this?</div>

</div>What I think that is, is the fact the shadow portion which can't crit, hits about the same as the physical's crit. And in the combat log, they are both using the same name. So your recounts highest hit is the shadow part, and the highest crit is physical.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>If 26 of those "hits" are actually the shadow portion of your 26 crits, you're looking at 26*2/90 = 57.8% crits.<br>
<br>
Edit:<br>
Just realized i messed that up. 26 crits means 38 hits (total of 64 attacks) which means 40.6% crit rate. Need to do this less tired...<br>
<br>
Edit 2:<br>
While 40% is a bit low, 64 attacks isn't exactly a large enough sample size to say it's off.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Someone mentioned to me that Spell Penetration is affecting magic damage on bosses, which it hasn't done since Molten Core to my knowledge.  The person told me they tested some magic damage with and without Curse of Elements on the test Dummy and he saw an increase.  I don't have an 80 Warlock to test on the dummy (which is always level 83).<br>

I didn't think to drop Morbidity for BA, but yes, that certainly would be most optimal for single target. Always forget about Morbidity.<br>
<br>
Generally speaking though, your number seem relatively close to mine, which is good. Factoring in the slightly different spec and the slightly different gear set used (I assume), it makes sense. Your hit value is much more normal, which is good. Expertise is still oddly low and haste oddly high.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

In my gear, mostly HToC25, Reaping is no longer worth it. I am getting the previously mentioned spec, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100304130207/http://www.wowhead.com/?talent#jfVMVZZfM0Ixcdg0zx0uIqo:Lbs" target="_blank">Talent Calculator - World of Warcraft</a> , to be the highest for single target. <br>
<br>
Not everyone will want to use their dual spec for an AoE DPS spec, so 2 out of Conviction into Morbidity will be a better 'general' spec. <br>
<br>
GoD only comes back in pretty much the best gear possible (including Shadowmourne) and AoE.<br>
<br>
In better gear, Reaping once again becomes worth it, and dropping points out of Dark Conviction is the way to go, unless you want a separate spec for AoE and single target DPS.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1487747"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Was running some sims as well to try it out in my current gear - 258/245 with 264 MH, and current 17/0/54 (current spec) came out as 90 dps below your 15/0/56, curernt 17/0/64 with GoD as ~300 lower dps. What sort of stats did you use to make GoD come that much closer?<br>
<br>
I also found this curious little thing though, for some reason the sim has listed <br>
Pestilence| 0 | 0| 1| 100| 0| 0| 0| <br>
without using GoD. There's only one there, but I'm still finding that quite odd.<br>
<br>
I'm also getting a really weird number for weapon speed value:<br>
WeaponSpeed | 183.33 <br>
Could this be because I'm using a 3.4 weapon currently?<br>
<br>
<br>
Also tried some simming in a regular 51/0/20 spec with some people here still claiming blood is superior for single target, but I keep getting it ~500 dps below 15/0/56. Is there something about blood dps the sim doesn't sim accurately, which would account for the differences in dps, or is everybody just assuming blood is better without having actually tested it?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Otherwise, not too different. Agi and Crit don't scale near as well, as expected. ArP does scale as well, as does Weapon DPS. ArP will surpass strength when you factor in stuff I excluded - such as the Shadowmourne proc. <br>

<br>
So if GoDD seems to stay would that mean the rotation would look like: IT-PS-BSx2-SS / SSx3 / Repeat from start...<br>
<br>
If so, <br>
<br>
Will there need to be 2 full points in epidemic?  From my tests one point seems to cut it with the above rotation.<br>
<br>
<br>
I personally favor the above rotation over the GoD one as I had trouble on any movement fights with diseases reapplication.<br>
<br>
Edit: This wasnt the case as far as epidimic. 2 points is needed. I also noticed that DC isnt utilized as much with the above rotation, and with the nerf to SS, It leaves us a bit crippled imo.<br>
<br>
Anyone one come up with any better rotations utilizing GoDD?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Had thought of it aswell but I guessed his friend was an unholy DK - EbP has the same effect.<br>
<br>
If he is an unholy DK there are several possibilities - one of them being that EbP and CoE stack... and that would be simply insane for raid dps. The other is that Spen affects PvE in general once more if there is a possibility of negative Spen.<br>
<br>
Could someone with both a Lock &amp; a DK available verify this?<br>

Spen would be the new stat since a 25 Spen gem would be equal to 4.51% magical damage increase.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

After a brief test on dummies...it almost seems adding in a second SS as in BS BS SS SS then dump for the second rune set works to perfection. Only going BS BS SS leaves one less DC and Im clipping the diseases by a few seconds.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">So if GoDD seems to stay would that mean the rotation would look like: IT-PS-BSx2-SS / SSx3 / Repeat from start...<br>
<br>
If so, <br>
<br>
Will there need to be 2 full points in epidemic?  From my tests one point seems to cut it with the above rotation.<br>
<br>
<br>
I personally favor the above rotation over the GoD one as I had trouble on any movement fights with diseases reapplication.<br>
<br>
Edit: This wasnt the case as far as epidimic. 2 points is needed. I also noticed that DC isnt utilized as much with the above rotation, and with the nerf to SS, It leaves us a bit crippled imo.<br>
<br>
Anyone one come up with any better rotations utilizing GoDD?</div>

I wonder if there is a gear level that Reaping+Epidemic &gt; 5/5 Dark Conviction. Consider says there is but i'm not so sure.<br>
<br>
*edit* <br>
<br>
After thinking more would it be possible to take Epidemic (but not Reaping) and do a rotation of:<br>
<br>
IT-PS-BSx2-SS<br>
SS-BSx2-SS<br>
<br>
You would get an extra SS at the cost of a IT-PS (less then 2 BS) and the cost of only 2 Talent points.<br>

Just grab two points of Morbidity. It will hurt your AoE a large amount though.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>You're correct, but I also added the stats from the 2pc t10 and threw in the badge cloak as well (my cloak is bad =/)<br>

Also, I wouldn't have any points in necrosis after 2pc t10 as I would have reaping instead. (assuming I reach the point where reaping &gt; necrosis with that. Probably would, but haven't simmed it yet)<br>

</div>Something like gaining a x% damage boost to SS when using death runes on scourge strike would work. It'd also be somewhat more interesting than a simple +x% damage to x ability. It'd both emphasize scourge strike, and make reaping more attractive. It may not be technically possible on blizzard's end, though.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Hardly surprising though really, but even so I think there could have been better solutions. How could they have failed to see this on the ptr and catch it then if its so unacceptable?</div>

</div>They failed to see it, because gimmick encounters tend to highlight gamemechanic design issues. In this case the gimmick encounter was Twins, which were not the subject of testing on the PTR (if you could play ToC at all on the ptr - never tried this).<br>
<br>
Twins offer a percentage damage buff, which scourge strike double dips (this is alway very bad ... as seen in the deep wound double dipping on Thaddius and Malygos buff stacking).<br>
Couple this with the fact that double crits were possible (which in itself scale in a quadratic nature with crit percentage) and you get hotfix material. <br>
<br>
Now that double crits are out of the way, can somebody tell me if the double dipping is removed too? If not, I'd anticipate that in the not too distant feature as this will haunt scourge strike all the way down until it gets gimmicked out of proportion again.<br>
<br>
As a matter of fact, I'm curious: Anyone tried spark stacking on Malygos the last two days? The max crits there must have been completely out of this world when using 4 sparks. Remember that twins buff is 200%, while 4 sparks should result in a 1.5^4*100%=ca. 500% damage buff. If I am not completely off the highest hits possible there would have been 25/4 = 6.25 times as high as on the  twins ^^<br>
EDIT: Forgot that extreme spark stacking is not any longer possible on Malygos. Suppose 25man Thaddius would have produced the highest results then.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>As has been said many times in this thread Necrosis is a pretty decent talent for single target damage. The hotfix has not changed this. The benefit of Morbidity and Bladed Armour is that they have an effect on AoE DPS (dramatic in the case of Morbidity).<br>
<br>
Since almost every single fight boss fight in ICC has AoE components its generally not recommended to pull points out of BA or Morbidity (2/3 Morbidity is okay) to put points in Necrosis.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

These are the stat weights I came up with using the gear I currently have. The values don't seem too bad.<br>

TLDR:<br>
12-00-59 and 17-00-54 with 2 points in Dirge and 3 in Necrosis are equivalent as long as you have the 4p t9 bonus. After, 12-00-59 will be the spec of choice.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1488183"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Front page updated with what I have been able to confirm up until now (meaning I haven't looked into Afabar's above post yet, although I do remember specifically testing 12/0/59 and finding it suboptimal. If I were to guess, 300 second fight + crit rng is what is showing the talent to underperform in his tests, and not that it's actually best, but such is simply my assumption. I'll look into it).<br>
<br>
This update was rushed, relatively speaking, for obvious reasons, but I did the best I can. Expect more throughout the weekend.<br>

Also, for the record, yes, I do save (almost) all previous versions of the thread. Just in case. It didn't really help in this case, but regardless. Fun fact: The post with formatting is about 30 pages long in Word and over 7000 words - over a 50% increase compared to the very first version.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1488200"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->how come that, with the updated statsweight, expertise got such a high value ?<br>
<br>
i mean, the only things which are dependant on expertise are scourge strike, autoattack and plaguestrike.<br>
while you simply lose the autoattack if it gets dodged it isnt that much of a loss dps-wise, autoattack is more a small part of ur dps.<br>
with ss and ps u can just reaply it as the rune doesnt get used, so u only "waste" a gcd which unholy has some free between skills anyways.<br>
so whats the matter for beeing it so impartant ?<br>

As to why haste has gone up on everybody else's stat ratings, it basically comes down to the fact that haste was the only stat unaffected by the Scourge Strike nerf. Every other stat we measure affected SS damage, so now that SS is no longer glorious, the value of every stat besides haste has gone down, but since they're all measured relative to AP (which also went down in value), it makes it look like haste got stronger.<br>

Does this mean that GoD is now inferior on all stages of gear? It feels somewhat unlikely looking at parses linked in this thread. At least Makiaveli's was done with GoD - if GoDD is a sensible upgrade over it we would be looking at closing to 9k single target damage which sounds huge considering the nerf.<br>
Another fact to consider is that he was running a Reaping rotation, since he only BSed 6 times.<br>
<br>
GoD's attractiveness atm is that of trading a BS-IT-PS sequence with a Pest-SS one. The loss is the extra DC damage from GoDD.<br>
<br>
Makaveli's DCs did 221k damage. GoDD would have netted him a 30k dmg increase, or 108 dps.<br>
<br>
Now looking at PS IT vs SS and BS BS vs SS is a lot more complex. He only PS and IT'd once, without diseases up; however it's easy to imagine SS overtaking the duo of abilities considering 1 crit and 1 hit did less than the average shadow portion of SS.<br>
For BS too, the average of SS is well above that of 2 BS.<br>
<br>
I understand we're on the thin ice of empyrical data and napkin math, but the evidence at the moment seems to be still in favour of Reapin. Am I missing something?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Another question, I don`t understand, why we put 2 Points into morbidity for the 10% higher Death Coil damage and now that we don`t use Reaping, we put those 2 points in Necrosis?

<br>
Those, as well as the spec links, are corrected.<br>
<br>
As previously discussed, GoD will come back into fashion, it simply won't be until the end of ICC, as it requires very strong gear (near BiS) to make it happen. Considering such a level of gear is currently unattainable I didn't bother to make note of it, but I will, once I can decide how to word it.<br>
<br>
As to Reaping, 2 BS is inferior to 1 SS. Absolutely. There's no question about that. The issue is that the gain from those three talent points to make such a trade off isn't as large as the gain from those three talent points in Dark Conviction (or whatever talent) would be. <br>
<br>
Let's say one's average SS is 10,000 and 2xBS is 7500. That gives a gain of 2500 damage every 20 seconds, or 125 dps. That comes out to measly 42 dps a point, subpar relative to the other talents available. Thus, while a dps gain, it's simply not as large of a dps gain as the alternatives.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1488547"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->@Kaienn: Likely an oversight. Using two Blood Strikes on the second part of the rotation adds a global compared to the Reaping rotating where you simply use SS. If you add up all of the GCDs used in a non-reaping rotation, you'll end up with essentially no time to spare at the end of the 21 second disease durations to refresh them before they fall off.<br>

A high enough amount of haste might let get get away by the skin of your teeth (due to reducing the GCD evoked on IT and DC), but that's pushing it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>14 unhasted GCDs take 21 sec to execute even before accounting for network latency. Theoretically this refresh would be by the skin of your teeth even with very high haste and very low effective latency unbuffed; without any haste at all it ought to be theoretically impossible (the theory would, of course, be proven wrong if your data is accurate).<br>
<br>
Are you sure that nobody in your group had a WoA totem down through the "unhasted" rotation test? If you were indeed able to do this completely unhasted (even sometimes), then that would suggest that some kind of "latency leeway" like for non-instant spells might have been added to instants, which would obviously warrant further testing.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I can confirm that double-dipping is not removed, which is why I ran UH on twins instead of going back to Blood for cleave damage.

Being slightly WoL-stupid, I can't find my max hit, but the average hit from my shadow-portion Scourge Strike is about 2.5x my average physical hit, with my total shadow-portion damage coming in at almost 8x my total physical SS damage.  I'm quite sure I remember seeing combined SS totals for around 70k under Empower.  Certainly nowhere close to the 180k hits I saw Wednesday night, but still drastically increased.<br>

I have a hard time imagining they can do anything to change the double-dipping aspect of the fight for any ability with two distinct sources of damage: doesn't Ignite still double-dip for fire mages?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The spec pretty much is the same as the one posted by OP, the only thing changed is from 2/2 Epidemic to 2/3 Morbidity for AoE. With Dark Death being replaced by SS (losing 5% DC damage), the reaping rotation can be achieved and still have a bit stronger AoE. Of course this is speculation and I only have testings from heroics and dummies. Both specs have 5/5 necrosis.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Drain life has a flat 10% chance to proc "on hit." There is no ICD.<br>
<br>
The definition of on hit is somewhat more expansive than "melee hit" or "physical hit". It excludes spells like Death Coil and DOT ticks, but includes things like Blood-Caked Blade and the shadow portion of Scourge Strike. The best way to get a model of the weapon's DPS for DK would be to test each of your DPS abilities individually. <br>
<br>
Applying and refreshing diseases may be an opportunity to proc Drain Life. For example, when Retribution applies or refreshes Righteous Vengeance and Blood Corruption (our two DOTs) it act as independent opportunities to proc Drain Life in addition to the white or yellow hit that triggers the application/refresh.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Picked up Bryntroll too and analyzed my recount stats for several Lady Deathwhisper tries where I, obviously, was on add duty. Though it might have that 10% proc chance it almost always tourned out for me to be about 4 ppm (should be 5ppm on a single target encounter on average), proccing for something just short off 3k which turns out to be a 200 DPS increase overall (250 then on 100% single target). Hard to believe, that any other weapon with the same ilvl could gain you the same increase through mere stats.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

PS – IT – BS – SS – BS – DC – HoW<br>
SS – BS – SS – BS – DC – DC– (DC)<br>

Well after the first BS in the second half of the rotation the FU runes will be off CD since you used a SS right after the first BS in the first half of the rotation.

		<div id="post_message_1491049"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->My SS crit chance seems very low, I believe the meters are showing the physical portion critting seeing as how the shadow no longer crits. My personal crit rating was at 36.19% at the time and SS definitely crit more often previous to 3.3.<br>
It usually crits between 17%-24% on most fights, was testing it in 10H toc, picture is for jaraxxus.<br>
Have been using the most recent non-reaping spec and rotation.<br>
Any obvious idea's I'm overlooking?<br>

The numbers Beberionn provided (with others being very similar, but as his post is just a couple above) put the proc at being worth (2995.9 x 8.75) / 60 = 436.9 DPS, which is the equivalent of 611-699 AP.

AoE might seem like an exception where you would want a different weapon, but it really isn't. The main thing you lose from Cryptmaker, the strongest alternative, is simply ArP (from the weapon itself and from the item you swap to pick up hit) and weapon speed, which have no more effect on AoE than Bryntroll's proc, so it's not a factor.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Just curious, has anyone considered Shadow's Edge as a possible weapon to use pre-hard modes?

</div>If you gem both with 2x20 Strength you get:<br>
<br>
22 Str, 92 Crit, 92 ArP, 0.3 weapon speed vs. the Bryntroll proc.<br>
<br>
Taking the ilvl 245/258 stat weights, this adds up to 521 AP, which is still 100 short of the estimated AP value of the Bryntoll proc. However, as you gear up, ArP and weapon speed become more valueable, so in ICC gear Shadow's Edge might slightly pull ahead. The heroic version of Bryntoll would still be better, though.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I was calculating ilvl264 set not BiS. I also don't see much point of calculating values for BiS because there are no upgrades for BiS and thats what we use AEP for - to see upgrades.<br>

- T10.1 = 4xT10, 282/3.6 weapon, Greatness + DC normal, ilvl251/258 gear<br>

- T10.3 = 4xT10, 344/3.7 weapon, DC heroic + DC normal, ilvl277 gear<br>

So there we go ArP value mystery solved! However putting BiS values on first page is misleading in my opinion because it will take a long time before we get there - and most likely we won't fully. I mean look at your gear, my gear, other peoples gear - we didn't managed to complete ilvl258 set. My realistic aim is Shadowmourne or at least heroic Bone Arbiter with ilvl264 everywhere plus ilvl277 item here and there.<br>
<br>
Going back to stats values we can see that:<br>
- STR drops a little with T10 but stays constant after, it is still best stat<br>
- Crit and AGI drops in value when switching to T10 but then go back as you gear to catch up in BiS<br>
- Exp value goes up with T10 and after that very slowly goes up<br>
- ArP value goes up quite a lot when you gear up<br>
- Haste goes up as you gear up<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>it all boils down to logistics<br>
<br>
the majority of the time you will be running up to a boss to engage (yes there are a few that will spawn neutral then turn hostile)<br>
<br>
during the running you have 2 options:<br>
1. use IT<br>
2. do nothing<br>
<br>
once you're at boss you have 3 options<br>
1. use IT<br>
2. use PS<br>
3. use BS<br>
<br>
You could argue in favor of any of the 3, bottom line is you'll be casting each one of them in quick succession. If you're running to the boss there really is no argument that you will choose option 1 over doing nothing. However overall difference in damage output based on what you start a boss fight with will hardly be above 10k.  If you think that's a lot in a 10 million hp fight consider an SS crit proc, or a dodge/parry or fumbling your rotation for a second and so on. It really is not worth drasticly altering your rotation over a one time damage gain. If it meant giving you a sustained dps boost then it's another story.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Incorrect.  The base proc chance is 11.3333% per swing (equivalent to precisely 2 PPM base), not 10%.  I ran a 6 hour basic melee parse (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100310014554/http://img46.imageshack.us/img46/4075/wowscrnshot121409011855.jpg" target="_blank">Screenshot</a>), total proc-able attacks was 10615 (8200 Melee, 2415 BCB), total procs was 1193, giving a calculated proc rate of 11.24%.<br>
<br>
My other findings from my long hours of testing:<br>
<br>
- Able to proc off of a BCB strike.<br>
- Able to double proc off of a melee and it's resulting BCB strike (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100310014554/http://img171.imageshack.us/img171/2593/wowscrnshot121309043900.jpg" target="_blank">Screenshot</a>)<br>
- Able to double proc off of the two parts of a Scourge Strike. (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100310014554/http://img205.imageshack.us/img205/4610/wowscrnshot121309103345.jpg" target="_blank">Screenshot</a>)<br>

- Dancing Rune Weapon cannot proc the drain.<br>
- Cannot crit.<br>
- Based on spell hit and is capable of missing.<br>
- Damage per proc does not scale with stats.<br>
- Is affected by +damage buffs such as Blood Presence and Bloody Vengeance, as well as spell damage increases such as Curse of Elements. <br>
<br>
Assuming a normal Blood rotation (9 weapon attacks per 20 second rotation), the weapon has 5.6 procs per minute before any haste buffs. Minimum rotational proc rate with raid buffs (specifically Windfury) is 6 PPM. This is an average dps of 227.3 before any damage increasing buffs (322.0 dps including Blood Presence, Bloody Vengeance, and Curse of Elements).<br>
<br>
Assuming a normal 20 second Unholy rotation (11 weapon attacks per 20 second rotation, since SS counts for double), the weapon will have 6.2 PPM base and 6.7 PPM base in a raid, 252.7 base dps (328.4 with Ebon Plague and Blood Presence).<br>
<br>
Assuming Consider's Value of 1.4-1.6 AP per 1 DPS is accurate (and holds for Blood, probably an unwarranted assumption, since my fiddling around with the sim put the value at around 2.3 for Blood), that puts the proc at a value of 483 AP for Blood at raid baseline, 492.6 for Unholy.  Assuming the heroic version has the same proc rate (just amplified damage), Blood will have a dps value of 359.5 and an EP of 539.3, and 368.3 dps and 552.5 EP for Unholy.<br>
<br>
However, the value of the proc increases as one acquires haste, to the point where for any weapon that beats it on overall EP, there is a haste point in which Bryntroll overtakes it.  The 625 threshhold requires 109% total haste, though, or 43.3% from gear.<br>
<br>
However, reading over the posts in here, if the <i>application</i> of diseases is able to proc the effect (something I did not test yet), that would increase the proc, dps, and EP value for the proc for both specs noticably and reducing the necessary haste threshhold.  For both specs, that would grant an additional 6 proc chances per minute, upping Blood's to 328.4 DPS, 492.6 EP for 264, 359.5 DPS, 552.5 EP for 277 (or 755.3 and 826.9 EP, respectively, if my reading of 2.3 AP : 1 DPS for blood), and Unholy's to 335 DPS, 503 EP for 264, 378.7 DPS, 568.1 EP for 277.  That also lowers the threshhold for 625 to 27.8% haste from gear (still pretty high).<br>
<br>
Ultimately we need a solid figure for DPS:AP before the true worth of this proc can be calculated, though.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Correct, I chose the 3 glyphs that are listed in the "single target" section.<br>
<br>
I have a multi-target/AOE build mainly for when I grind heroics due to lowered DnD cooldown. Am I supposed to use a different multi-target/AOE rotation then when fighting multiple mobs since I don't have GoD?<br>
<br>
The guide is a little confusing in that aspect due to lack of clarity. Obviously that rotation won't work since I don't have GoD, but there's no alternative rotation there.<br>
<br>
[Edit]<br>
<br>
...or is the "multiple" rotation FOR the "multiple" spec/glyph set, to be used regardless of single/many mobs?<br>
<br>
I'm taking that section to mean "use this rotation when facing more than one mob", just FYI.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Okay, thanks for the clarification! <br>
<br>
Yeah, I know GoD doesn't affect anything other than refreshing diseases on that last part - the problem I had was the blood runes were still WAY on cooldown after the BS + BB, and diseases were way expired by the time they were up. But it's moot now that I know to just omit the third line.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Curious as to why the Unholy rotations seem to always start with PS or IT. I would think given the 5/5 Desolation talents that it would be better to start out with BS (to get the 5% increased damage off all attacks), then proceed with diseases. Do the diseases not receive a coefficient?</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Another thing nobody has mentioned about why it's important to start with IT or PS is that they put up your diseases, and as an unholy DK that means they put up Ebon Plague, which is one of the main reasons your raid full of casters loves you so much.  Not putting up a disease as soon as you can means all the casters in the raid have reduced damage for a while.<br>
<br>
The first page doesn't list this, but another advantage to being an unholy DPS DK is that any time you have to run out of AOE, your pet continues to DPS, and particularly with 3.3 changes you can just let him stand in fire, take a <i>Foo Nova</i>, etc.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I'll double-check again, but I seem to recall my average damage being higher as blood.  Average for most of my parses put the proc at about 2700-2800 damage, which requires an 8-10% damage increase modifier over the 15% provided by Blood Presence.  Beyond that, in my large parse, the damage range on the proc was extremely wide, running from approximately 2300 (just BP on the low end of the proc range) to over 2900 (requiring both BP and BV on the top end of the range), and since I was just auto-attacking, BV fell off at fairly regular intervals.

				<div style="font-style:italic">I feel somewhat sheepish asking this, but searching the forums has left me more curious. Regarding bloodtap macro's, I've used both the macro from the OP and a similar one without the /stopcasting command. In both cases I need to spam the button in order to have Bone Shield cast, despite BT being off of the gcd. Some of the posts I found say that a single button press will cast both BT and Bone Shield, while I've never been able to do that; this results in my rotations being thrown off unless I replace a Blood Strike with the macro (non-reaping build). It seems that while BT is not on the gcd, the rune activation takes some time, as using the macro with all runes up results in an instant Bone Shield via unholy rune. My latency is ~60ms, if that has any bearing in this. <br>
<br>
Which is the expected behaviour for the macro and how are you incorporating it into your rotations? My assumption is that the functionality I am seeing is likely much easier to incorporate into a reaping rotation with both death runes up, prior to the SS, so perhaps I should just switch to a reaping build.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>I run with 750 ms so this might not be helpful but I use the<br>
<br>
/cast Blood Tap<br>
/stopcasting<br>
/cast Bone Shield<br>
<br>
Which I combine with<br>
<br>
/cast Blood Strike<br>
/cast !Rune Strike<br>
/cancelaura Blood Tap<br>
<br>
and I use it when all runes are down at the very end of a rotation after blowing my 3rd SS, usually when I have low RP for an extra DC so it goes a little something like this:<br>
<br>
PS&gt;IT&gt;BS&gt;BS&gt;SS&gt;DC | SS&gt;SS&gt;SS&gt;MACRO (Press Twice Quickly) DC&gt;DC&gt;HoW<br>
<br>
If you do it correctly you end up with extra GCD's from Boneshield, 1 extra DC and horn of winter. When combining that with GCD's from refreshing diseases and the first blood strike it should fit seemlessly into your next rotation.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
I'd rather not incite a lengthy discussion about run speed boot enchants, but the benefit gained from them has always been something I was skeptical about.<br>
<br>
If you're running <i>from</i> something. It's very likely you're not going to be using your runes anyway, so switching to UH Presence is better than the enchants. If you're able to DPS immediately after you're done running, you can just switch to Blood Presence and hit Blood Tap to get the rune right back.<br>
<br>
If you're running a long distance (from one of the illusion rooms into Yogg's Brain Room, for instance), the same holds true.<br>
<br>
If you're not running from something or running a long distance, how much DPS will the run speed actually give you over Icewalker? Like you said, though, the boot enchant is easy to get. Icewalker is cheap as well. It's not as if each enchant is worth several hundred gold, so I suppose it's a trivial argument.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I don't agree with Herbalism being useless to Dps. Beside the obvious fact you don't have to pay for pots and flasks  the the healing skill can be used for gain 600 atk Power before the fight starts.  <br>
1. Use Lifeblood ( Greatness procs )<br>
2. Haste pot<br>
3. Army<br>
4. Diseases.... etc..<br>
  and if your have you rotation perfected, you can get your 3 PS in to maxout your dps for Gargoyle before you loose the effects form Greatness and the haste pot. I cant say that the extra 84 atk power form JC will out dps this the large burst in the long run, but its a something to think about.</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>I doubt it. First of all you're pretty much wasting greatness uptime outside of combat by using it this way. I think every advantage the greatness on army would give is offset by the fact it's ticking away outside of combat. <br>
The damage increase your army will see from the greatness buff is pretty small as well, especially after the nerf.<br>
<br>
The haste pot is not something that is only for Herbalists.<br>
<br>
If I'm using army, i generally pop them before a fight without any procs up. Save my trinkets for gargoyle which generally does a lot more damage as well. Another benefit is that since I personally use both greatness and WFS, they're always up when gargoyle comes back up due to the 45 sec ICD.<br>
<br>
I tried popping army in combat for a while too, but i figured out that the damage in the end isnt worth it. If i'm doing 9000 dps, and army does about 900 dps over it course, than the 4 second channeling time and the 40 second up time cancel each other out in damage done.<br>
<br>
But i think that the loss from 42 extra strength (JC) and losing at the very least 4-5 seconds on greatness (realistically probably closer to its full duration, unless your tank times running in well), is not really worth going herbalism over to get an early greatness buffed army off.<br>

</div>I believe that in the OP, it is stated that even on a Patchwork type fight, channeling AoTD mid combat is still a DPS gain. While you may be correct that it is small, it's a DPS gain nonetheless.<br>
<br>
 The damage from AoTD isn't negligible - in one of the logs I posted above, AoTD did ~35k damage - this is damage that is essentially 'free', as you can (and should when applicable) cast it pre-pull, allowing no interruptions on your rotation. <br>
<br>
With regards to my original question, I was leaning more towards an 'x AP provides y more damage for AoTD', if anyone had some type of information on that. While small, it may be something that can be modeled in the simulator (if it hasn't been already).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I know, but that damage comes at a cost.<br>
<br>
If you are doing 8500 dps at the moment you channel army. (Probably even higher if you channel army while buffs are up), than in the 4 seconds you channel you lose 4*8500 = 34000 damage. <br>
That means your army has just gained you 1k damage in a boss fight of 25 million HP. Not to mention it might force your runes out of sync a bit, forcing an early disease refresh or using a cooldown like ERW.<br>
<br>
In that case it seems more of a gain to just pop army before the fight, and have it do crappy damage but without affecting your dps.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I have an idea about changing the spec if you already have an unholy dk providing ebon plague.  It would involve giving up points from ebon plaguebringer, necrosis, dark conviction, and bladed armor to get black ice.  This also kind of makes me wonder how it would be if black ice was first tier in the frost tree.  If someone can crunch the numbers on it and get back to me that would be great.</div>

</div>How about you crunch the numbers yourself and then argument your point in front of everyone else here instead of expecting people to do your work for you? There's posts in this very same thread talking about the viability of Black Ice specs and how great it'd be if it was tier 1. There's no need for anyone but you to do any further research on it unless you can provide data that contradicts that information on your own.<br>
<br>
Summoning ghouls during Choking Gas Bomb is a great idea. Avoiding getting hit by the flasks is very hard unless you are using a boss mod with a timer and anticipate their spawning. There's very little leeway if you don't and I think most people will get hit by them many times. It's indeed a fantastic moment to summon your ghouls. Didn't try ghouls at Rotface but there's enough time without a big slime at the beginning of the fight for a pre-summon, specially if you don't cleanse the first slime to pair it with the second.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

It will put RD on perma-cooldown as if the ghoul had been summoned, but since it wasn't, the only way to solve the problem that I found was to change zones or switch specs.

Pre-casting AotD has several things going for it: Firstly it provides you with RP which when combined with DnD contributes towards being able to use your first death coil straight after summoning Gargoyle assuming you summon it straight away. It also allows you to save ERW for a more advantageous moment for a better DPS gain or for when runes come off cooldown in bad pairs.<br>
<br>
As for diseases I am generally not worried about clipping the last tick personally. I tend to artificially extend my rotation in a lot of ways such as casting Blood Tap and Bone Shield at the end of a rotation's second rune cooldown set and hitting Horn of Winter before RP dump. This generally allows for diseases to drop off but if it doesn't it isn't the end of the world. It is better to get your runes onto their cooldowns than wait for disease to drop off if you have no RP to spend or no other maintenance ( bone shield, ghoul commands etc ) to do.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Furthermore, popping AotD and being unable to summon ghoul as well immidietly after, skill being darkened out (also in blood offspec).<br>
<br>
Anyone else expirienced this?</div>

I have had it happen to me with my ghoul in a few heroics and a raid once, i had to log off my Death Knight for 5 minutes before it was fixed, it was very weird. The most recent time was yesterday during a H-Nexus run for my frost badges and after killing the first pull and starting to fight the dogs i sacrificed my ghoul, healer had d/ced and tank had lagged out, so i had aggro, and after the fight i noticed my Button wasn't starting to fill up, it was acting like i had a ghoul out already, i tried using /reloadui and nothing worked, so i just finished the instance without my ghoul, I was able to summon my gargoyle and use AoTD with no issues, I even was able to use Raise Ally (healer d/ced again and the mage got destroyed) and it worked fine, but i wasn't able to use my ghoul for the rest of the instance.<br>
<br>
I have no idea for the reasoning behind why i couldn't summon my ghoul, but I've had it happen to me occasionally since 3.1,Ulduar came out.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Lately I have been casting AotD right after the fight starts and I have all my procs up and Gargoyle cast. I immediately use ERW after casting Gargoyle or a couple of my procs fall off and I want all of them up for when I cast AotD. Last week and now this week too everytime I have tried to do this my AotD spell is immediately interrupted/stops casting and I cannot figure out why. This has happened on several bosses in Ulduar/ToGC/ICC. Has anyone else experienced this problem, heard about this or know why it could be happening? Thanks.</div>

</div>This has been happening to me since 3.3 and I have not been able to find the cause of it. Sometimes the cast will go off, other times it is instantly interrupted (more times than not it is interrupted). At first I thought it only happened when a boss started to cast a spell while I was casting AOTD as this was when I mainly noticed it happening, however after using it on more bosses I found that my cast could still go off when the target was casting. I then thought it was due to taking damage, however I have been able to get the full cast off on Marrowgar during his whirl wind, and been able to get the cast off on Putricide during phase 3 with all of the raid damage going on. I have talked to every DK in my guild, and people who have DK alts and none have experienced this problem. The only thing I can think of is that some addon might be stopping it, or that there is an actual bug in the game and it only seems to be affecting some people (I'm not a retard, I would know if I was moving or pressing buttons to stop the cast after I used it).<br>
<br>
I know someone posted before that it is better to cast it pre pull, however some fights it's better to wait to use it (Gunship) and others you can use it twice if you use it right at the begining and towards the end (Putricide) so I wouldn't say "Just cast it pre pull" is always a viable solution.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Did AotD put the ghoul on cooldown or was it on cooldown to begin with? I've had Raise Dead gray out permanently when switching from unholy to another spec. It seems like sometimes when the ghoul despawns it doesn't "die" and thus doesn't start the cooldown timer. Manually dismissing the ghoul before changing specs seems to prevent the bug.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>The reason for pre-casting AotD is that it takes 4s to cast, so that's 4s you're not DPSing the boss.  A reason to DPS the boss and then summon the army is to get buffs/procs up before summoning..<br>
<br>
So if you're trying to decide between summoning them pre-fight and summoning them mid-fight with your procs up, the question is which is more damage: 4s of damage from you + 30s of damage from an unbuffed army, or 30s of damage from a buffed army.<br>
<br>
I found a random World of Logs report with a couple of Unholy DKs who use AotD on Festergut:<br>
<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100310090742/http://www.worldoflogs.com/reports/iuvv6cmwviye17bd/sum/damageDone/?s=3100&amp;e=3331" target="_blank">World of Logs - Real Time Raid Analysis</a><br>
<br>
One DK does 8k personal DPS on average, and his army does 32329 damage total.  Another Unholy DK in the same raid does also does 8k personal DPS on average and his army does 34145 damage total.  Given that, it seems impossible that stopping DPS for 4s to summon your army will do more overall damage than pre-summoning it.  Assuming these guys both pre-summoned, so the damage an unbuffed army does is roughly 32,000.  For it to be worth not pre-summoning and instead waiting until your trinkets/sigils/weapon rune procs, they would have to do roughly double their damage when buffed vs unbuffed to make up for the DK losing 4s he could otherwise be attacking the boss.<br>
<br>
In fact, it may mean that it's questionable if you have the opportunity to summon AotD a second time in the fight, it is worth stopping DPS for the 4s it takes to summon them, since the damage done by the AotD over its duration is roughly the same as the the damage a DK would do in that same time (4s).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>A decent % of your dps comes from dot ticks/your ghoul. Also consider that it is possible to "catch up" those 4 seconds somewhat due to our rune cooldowns... On the other side I don't think you've considered what is perhaps the biggest potential dps loss from summoning army mid-combat, which is that it causes a lot of runes to be on CD for longer.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>In general, none of the EP values look out of whack, although the values seem to correspond to the upper end of gear.  That said a lot of it depends on the other details of the sim.  One thing you could do would be to consider the damage breakdown compared with an actual log.<br>
<br>
The ArPen value mostly depends on how much ArPen you have, which is a little bit hard to measure due to the fact you have the NES trinket.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1540750"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The best trinkets list is a little deceptive when trinkets have hit on them.  Hit is very important and powerful until you cap it which inflates the value of those trinkets, since they get the stat weight of a bunch of hit for the static aspect of the trinket.<br>
<br>
When you evaluate any gear with hit, you should really take anything related to stat weights with a big grain of salt.  Basically, anytime you equip a new piece of gear with hit at this gear level you will almost definitely be taking a different piece of gear with hit on it off (and maybe swapping a gem/enchant around).  If you're going to use stat weights you need to sum up all the stats on the new piece with hit, the new piece that replaces the old piece with hit and any gem/enchant you're swapping in and compare all that to the sum of the old piece with hit, the old piece you're replacing with the new piece with hit and and gem/enchant you're swapping out.  You should be finding that the effect of the hit should pretty much cancel out on both sides and what you're really comparing are the non-hit stats on the gear.<br>
<br>
Any kind of spreadsheet or gear manager will keep track of all this for you, which is what makes them so much better than BiS lists for practical use.  The list is accurate, read the bit in italics at the bottom though.<br>

As I'm understanding it, enhancement shaman and assasssination rogues are the best uses for the jar trinket, maybe ret paladins as well.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

About the ghoul issues posted. I also have experienced the Raise Dead button "graying out". Relog and zoning trigger the cooldown to start again. In my case it has happened when my ghoul dies, never when summoned. As frost I noticed that whenever I summoned my ghoul to fight the second boss in Nexus, the button would always gray out after the ghoul timer expired and become unusable. Other than that it has always been random.<br>
The AotD bug has never happened to me, but I've been getting a different bug not mentioned yet; my ghoul cooldown is 3 minutes when my ghoul dies when it should be 30 seconds as Unholy. This happened on Rotface last night, my ghoul died straight away at the start and I had a 3 minute cooldown timer to summon it again.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
It's been well accepted that the reaping build starts to pull ahead of the reapingless build after people acquire 2pc T10 and several pieces of ICC gear. <br>
<br>
When I plug in my own stats in Kahorie's Sim (Latest version 1.2.0.6) and check out the results for a reaping build versus a reapingless build, they are very similar, with only a neligible DPS difference between the two specs, even with the 2pc T10.<br>
<br>
Since the ReapingLess spec is much more friendly in fights with more than just the boss to damage (for example being able to spread ebon plague on all saurfang adds as they spawn without screwing up the rotation too much) shouldn't this spec still be used even after acquiring 2pc T10 and a few ICC pieces ?<br>
<br>
Here are the Sims I ran with the stats/gear currently on my armory : The rotations are the default ones provided in the Sim for both specs. Any thoughts ?<br>

<br>
I know back when 3.1 came out the suggested spec was 0/10/61 once gear was good enough.<br>
Now I've missed the entire ToC content and all patches and related theorycrafts, I'm wondering at what point we reverted back to a 17/0/54 format ? (searched this entire post for the answer in vain).<br>
<br>
While SS got changed to be half physical I still find alot of my damage comes from frost and shadow sources [~50%] (mainly Death Coil in the AMS friendly ICC fights incl constant rejuv).<br>
<br>
So just for fun and tests I decided to roll with a 1/10/60 spec like so: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100309152404/http://www.wowhead.com/?talent#jzZG0xZfMhIxcdg0ux0uIqo:Lbs" target="_blank">Talent Calculator - World of Warcraft</a><br>

		<div id="post_message_1541688"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Well, due to the way SS works, with the Shadow portion based on the Physical portion, 2/2 Two-Hand Spec adds ~5% to your SS alone, whereas 10% shadow only applies to the shadow portion of SS, making it a 5% increase overall. Add additional AP and Crit to that, and it adds up. Your numbers from your second parse are a bit skewed because you have Bryntroll, increasing the effectiveness of that spec by adding additional shadow damage, albeit only slightly.<br>
<br>
The only average damage I actually see going up a significant amount in the second parse (the rest being the same or lower) is Death Coil. (Bryntroll aside.)<br>
<br>
But I imagine the discrepancy here is likely due to the fact that you did not have your Ghoul out for the first parse.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Hehe yeah, sorry about the confusion was changing the parses just this second.<br>
<br>
To me it looks like fights where you can utilise AMS to its max and there is alot of range involved (pretty much every ICC fight so far excluding Saurfang) this spec seems to be putting out more effective dps... Atleast with a Bryntroll setup.<br>
<br>
I'd say at 264+ itemlevel range with the massive amount of ArmorPen. and a slower weapon, this spec will be outdated and 14/0/57 will be the clear winner.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Just looking at the spec, the points in Imp IT and RPM yield close to no dps increase and are simply filler. That is 10 talent points for 10% shadow/frost dmg increase, which is ~50% of your total damage. So its effectively 10 points for 5% dps increase.<br>
Assuming necrosis gives 4% dps at 5/5, 3 points in necrosis =2.4%. Using 15000 armor, bladed armor gives 417AP*0.71=296 dps, which is 2.96% of dps assuming 10k dps.<br>
2.96%+2.4% &gt;5% already, not including the 2 points in Dark Conviction, which will make the 14/00/57 pull ahead even more.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I often have to prioritize DC or I end up wasting rune power. The sim shows equal dps for DC&gt;SS and SS&gt;DC. The question is, does this still hold true for external rune power sources like AMS? You can't always choose the AMS timing.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Conclusion: Speccing for it does not pay off. You most likely can use all the rune power it provides, even in the standard Reaping spec. On hardmode fights you're better off saving AMS for certain boss abilites, so your healers can concentrate oh that glass cannon over there.<br>
Having the GoD and a "free" gcd doesn't help either. You have to use your runes when they pop up or you'll get in trouble with using Pestilence.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I am currently using the major glyphs It, DD, and Ghoul.  However, I have been thinking of testing out SS glyph for IT since i've obtained 2 pc t10.  My reasoning is that since SS is now the majority of dmg with reaping spec, having diseases up longer so I can fit in more SS or BS would be more beneficial to the 20% of disease dmg on IT.  (Single Target dmg)  On AE situations I think the IT glyph may still be the clear choice.  Basically what i'm getting at is that I am still not sold on the IT glyph and feel that perhaps other glyphs would be more beneficial.   Any thoughts?</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>SS-glyph is basically one extra SS per minute. Looking at my last Festergut parse my average IT did 2992 damage, my average PS 5893 (at 75% crit, so let's say 5200 damage with a normal crit rate), my average SS did 11972 damage. That is a gain of 3780 damage over 60 seconds or 63 dps.<br>
<br>
My FF ticked for 1821 on average, without glyph that would have been 1517.5 damage, so the IT glyph is a 303.5 damage gain per tick. There were approximately 17.6 ticks per minute (due to clipping, running to the mob, etc.), that's 5311.25 damage per minute or 88.5 dps. There were 62 Wandering Plague ticks, let's assume half of them were from Frost Fever. That's another 7.6 ticks per minute, equaling to 2304.12 damage per minute or 38.4 dps. The overall value of the IT glyph is the sum of those two: 127 dps, twice the value of the SS glyph.<br>
<br>
So IT glyph is, has always been and will probably always be better than SS glyph even on single target fights. It is only one parse, but except for the PS rate, crit rates were around their expected value and the difference in value of the glyphs is huge.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>How didn't I realize this earlier? I feel so stupid now. Thanks for this post. I soak RP on every given opportunity and our Druids have Revitalize, which should make Morbidity a DPS gain over Dark Conviction. 2% crit is also quite RNG, while Morbidity is constant 10% more DC damage. It's also nice to have DnD CD reduced for trash and Deathwhisper/Gunship adds. Personally I'm going to go 12/0/59 right away.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>the glyph of blood strike only works with Snares, which are usually provided by a feral druid tank (infected wounds), a Frostfire mage (frostfire bolt) or an unholy DK with the talent Desacration.<br>
<br>
Since we don't use desacration in our build and most mages are raiding as arcane at the moment, this pretty much leaves the feral tanks. Even so, I don't know if this glyph would be a better option anyways. Even if your BS does more damage than FF, you should compare the increase in damage with either glyphs and not the total damage done by the ability.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I use the 17/0/54 build still, i have 717 ArP and my blood strikes do more damage than frost fever all the time<br>
Last 25 man we did on Festergut Blood Strike did 211805 damage compared to 158981damage done by frost fever and i am using the Icy Touch glyph to so i was wondering would you get the 20% bonus on  <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100305135843/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=43826" target="_blank">Glyph of Blood Strike</a> from thunderclap etc?

</div>I ran a few sims with the Team Robot Simulator and it sims the BS-glyph spec about 80 dps on average below DD-Reaping. The standard Team Robot rotation doesn't Blood Tap -&gt; Blood Strike, so that's an additional 1000 damage every minute, but the standard Team Robot Reaping rotation doesn't Blood Tap -&gt; Scourge Strike either. In any event sims are pretty close and I suspect anything but tank&amp;spank plus the possible effects of RP soaking would favour DD.<br>
<br>
edit: The funny thing is, it sims BS-Reaping in between those two specs, i.e. 40 dps behind DD-Reaping and 40 dps ahead of BS-noReaping. I'll have yet to think what to make of that.<br>
<br>
edit2: I get the same results for your gear (i.e. DD-reaping &gt; BS-reaping &gt; BS-noreaping), so it's probably got something to do with the simulators<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Actually, snares are no longer relegated to just being movement speed slowing effects - they include attack speed slowing effects now too at least for the Arcane/Fire mage's Torment the Weak. Each of the tanks provide the requisite attack speed slow (Icy Touch, Thunder Clap, Judgments of the Just, Infected Wounds). A raiding environment is more or less guaranteed to have at least one of those, and it may yet give the Glyph of Blood Strike some credibility so long as the glyph does work with those snares.<br>
<br>
Even if it does, I just don't see it comparing to the Glyph of Icy Touch though, which provides solid single target DPS and ridiculously inflated AE DPS.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I just checked a few of my parses and recalculated how damage would have evolved without Reaping and with BS glyph instead of DD glyph and it came out with about a 100 DPS loss for Festergut-style fights. However, this did not include the free points to spend in Dark Conviction and 3% crit should be more than 100 DPS (more like 150-180), so it appears that the spec really is competitive / perhaps slightly superior for this kind of fights.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1543512"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Glyph of Blood Strike sims better than I thought it would. Glyph of Blood Strike w/o reaping reads as a mere 10-20 dps loss for me vs. Dark Death w/reaping. Reaping-less pulls slightly ahead at certain gear levels. The problem is that in reality you have to have Infected Wounds up for it to work, which even with a feral tank can make target switching difficult. Dumping a point in Desecration is probably going to make it completely pointless.<br>
<br>
Target switching isn't very prevelant in ICC yet, the only real example so far is Putricide slimes as mentioned, which should already be covered by the Abom snare. It is worth considering the adds in Deathwhisper/Valthira and the three Blood Princes once they gain a heroic mode, not to mention whatever The Lich King has to offer. Unfortunately that's nothing but speculation for now.<br>
<br>
In any situation where you use Pestilence Glyph of Blood Strike would fall behind since you're not using the blood rune on BS (AoE, saurfang blood beasts, putricide green slime depending on your positioning). At the same time, depending on timing and how much you're AoEing, not having Reaping can make using Pestilence a lot easier since you don't have any Death Runes to waste.<br>
<br>
The increased Death Coil damage from Dark Death and extra GCD freed up with Reaping could lead to higher DPS with Revitalize/AMS, but it's hard to really tell.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Actually, snares are no longer relegated to just being movement speed slowing effects - they include attack speed slowing effects now too. This is the same issue as with the Arcane/Fire mage's Torment the Weak, each of the tanks provide the requisite attack speed slow (Improved Icy Touch, Thunder Clap, Judgments of the Just, Infected Wounds). A raiding environment is more or less guaranteed to have at least one of those, and it may yet give the Glyph of Blood Strike some credibility. .</div>

</div>Unless I'm mistaken, you're wrong. ToTW's tooltip says "snared or slowed", Glyph of BS says "snared". Only the snare of something like Infected Wounds (or Frostfire Bolt, which you're probably never going to see from your mages) would work.<br>
<br>
<br>
Bottom line it seems competitive on single target burn fights (which ICC is full of), but it is questionable on fights with dynamic targets.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Last 25 man we did on Festergut Blood Strike did 211805 damage compared to 158981damage done by frost fever and i am using the Icy Touch glyph to so i was wondering would you get the 20% bonus on Glyph of Blood Strike from thunderclap etc?

		<div id="post_message_1544357"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Yeah MaFire that's correct.  I posted some theorycrafting about it a while back, not clipping is better.   Also the you don't actually always lose RoR if you have another DK in the raid that's applying blood plague.<br>
<br>
You have to be a bit careful that you don't extend your rotation in the process, because ultimately that would be a dps loss.  The easiest thing I found to do was to swap the order you apply your diseases in every second cycle.  That allows you to get 13 ticks in 40 seconds, which is 97.5% of the number of ticks you get from a GoD cycle (And so removing one of the possible advantages for the GoD).  You can do that by either relying on the grace period to swap em, or in a reaping build, by using the death runes to put up diseases.<br>
<br>
With my (rotation based) sims it came out as at least a 100 dps increase twisting the diseases this way.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Except you also delay your rune usage by that much by waiting to let them fall off.<br>
Also, there's the problem with rune cd, assuming 0.0s is when you use IT and applies FF(and 10s rune cd).<br>
0.0 IT/FF<br>
1.5 filler<br>
3.0 PS/BP<br>
Following this, FF will drops at 21.0 while BP drops at 24.0. However, your Unholy rune will come back on 23.0, so at that point you either delay your rune even further, or you'll have to clip the disease, thus going back to the original rotation.<br>
<br>
Also, using your BP number, shouldn't it be<br>
non-RoR BP tick = (1384 / 1.1) = 1258.2<br>
and using the damage gain from RoR on PS/BP = 395.7 + 830.4 = 1226.1<br>
with a difference of 32.1 damage, I'm not sure where'd you get the ~3000 damage part from, please clarify?<br>
<br>
EDIT: On further pondering, there's also possible complication with rune's grace period too.<br>
If I'm not mistaken the grace period is 2.5s.<br>
So going by the time line above, the F rune would comes off cd(and into grace period) at 10.0, but since the U rune doesn't come off cd until 13.0, the frost rune is now out of grace period and goes into full 10s cd from then.

</div>Diseases are refreshed at 1.5 second intervals, so there is no filler. To further clarify, you could say that a different disease ticks every 1.5 seconds, so there's very minimal amount of waiting. Also, it may be obvious that if you have to wait &gt;2 seconds to refresh, then you should do it early. But if there's say &lt;1.5 seconds, it may be worth it to wait it out. I took the ~3000 from an average BP / FF tick from the WoL parse. While testing out this rotation, I haven't had any problems with the grace period as stated, they come back up off cooldown at about the same time.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>You are forgetting that you also lose whatever the very last ability you would have gotten to use on the boss is. Supposing in the last 1.5 seconds of the boss fight you were going to be using a SS. Now, because you waited an extra 1.5 seconds to reapply PS earlier on in that fight you no longer get to use that extra final SS. So the cost to gain an extra disease tick is 10% of a PS + 100% of a SS. <br>
<br>
So in a fight that lasts 280 seconds (14 full rotations) you end up waiting an extra 14 * 1.5 = 21 seconds overall to reapply PS. That costs you one full rotation in lost time or 1/14th of your overall special ability usage. Now it doesn't sound so good. The reality however is twice as bad as that and you will, end up losing twice as much time.<br>
<br>
This is due to the seldom considered two-second rule. You see if you use your runes within 2 seconds of them coming off cooldown they go back on cooldown as if you had used them the moment they came off cooldown. If it goes beyond that then they go back on cooldown as you would expect. So in a normal rotation your runes come off cooldown like (assume this shows runes coming off cooldown after your first rotation, so this starts 20 seconds into the fight).<br>

</div>Where every row is 1 gcd (generalising to 7 gcds per 10 seconds which is near enough to accurate). What you see is that in the second rotation, even though you used the first two runes for a SS after the U rune came off CD the F rune went back onto cooldown as if you had used it immediately. This is due to the two second rule. The same happens to the two blood runes. Even though you use them at the same instant for a SS when they come back as D runes, the first one goes back on CD with 1 GCD less time to go because you managed to use it within 2 seconds of coming off cooldown. So you get through the entire rotation in 14 GCDs and are ready to start over.<br>
<br>
Now, lets add in the extra GCD you are waiting to renew that blood plague.<br>

</div>The first * indicates the GCD you waste waiting before using your U rune to reapply blood plague. The second * indicates the extra GCD you lose because you didn't use your F rune within 2 seconds of it coming off of GCD. So the overall cost to you is that each rotation takes an extra 2 global cooldowns, you are going from 14 to 16 GDCs, the total cost over time will be 1/7th of your total ability usage. In short, waiting an extra 1.5 seconds for that last tick of EP is a very bad thing to do and will cost you a lot of DPS.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Yeah MaFire that's correct.  I posted some theorycrafting about it a while back, not clipping is better.   Also the you don't actually always lose RoR if you have another DK in the raid that's applying blood plague.<br>
<br>
You have to be a bit careful that you don't extend your rotation in the process, because ultimately that would be a dps loss.  The easiest thing I found to do was to swap the order you apply your diseases in every second cycle.  That allows you to get 13 ticks in 40 seconds, which is 97.5% of the number of ticks you get from a GoD cycle (And so removing one of the possible advantages for the GoD).  You can do that by either relying on the grace period to swap em, or in a reaping build, by using the death runes to put up diseases.<br>
<br>
With my (rotation based) sims it came out as at least a 100 dps increase twisting the diseases this way.</div>

</div>I'm simming higher without clipping but only a marginal dps increase, do you mind posting the rotation you used to sim with?<br>
<br>
The best way to do this is indeed use your Death Runes for diseases every two rotations, its pretty straight forward when you try it out on dummy/bossfight.<br>
<br>
Then I tried simming with <b>losing one point in Epidemic</b> and putting it in Morbidity which got some interesting results:<br>
<br>
2/2 Epidemic: <b>9921</b><br>
1/2 Epidemic: <b>9943</b><br>

I like to call it <b><u>Disease Juggling</u></b><br>
<br>
When your disease just ticked for the 18s mark, refreshing the disease that just ticked will allow your other disease to tick before you refresh it, due to it being a gcd away, and diseases being 1.5s apart. Note that this can't be applied to every 20s segment, but rather close to it.<br>

</div>As you can see in the data from the logs, for instance the second one since only 4 parts are bolded, it started with a PS / IT combo, but ended with a IT / PS combo, allowing for the extra disease tick in between the refresh at <b>[19:37:16.093]</b><br>
<br>
Over a fight this can contribute to quite a few extra disease ticks, and how I go about refreshing mine, I made this image a while ago to try and demonstrate it, but I think I explained it quite well with the logs, just for reference.<br>
<br>
I see alot of people just solely sticking to a rotation and refreshing diseases in that order, losing potential ticks.<br>

</div>That looks roughly right, it'll depend on your latency extra rp etc.  While it's a nominal DPS improvement.  You'd probably get more out of disease twisting even if you screw up a bit.<br>
<br>
For the sim of twisting diseases I just used an initial sequence of IT PS SS BS BS (dump)<br>
Then a repeating sequence of (2x) SS SS (PS IT) (dump) // SS SS BS BS (more dump)<br>
Where the diseases are swapped for the second cycle. <br>
In practice for many fights you can't run a perfect rotation but it's pretty easy to line up your disease refreshes to maximise the number of ticks you get.<br>
<br>
Eventually's pic sums it up.  The only thing you have to be a bit careful of is the timing, but if you're using death runes to apply the diseases it's actually quite forgiving on that (so you can sneak in extra dumps).  <br>

</div>That's true only if you drop a point from epidemic and naively apply the diseases. <br>
You can however setup a rotation (especially in a reaping build), so your diseases are offset by more than 3 seconds so you never lose EP.   Under some circumstances there are certain advantages to doing so. (You can get better uptime on your 2T9 bonus if you spread out your BS more).<br>
<br>
ETA:<br>
As an aside I wonder how much damage you have to in general to make it worth delaying your rotation by 1 gcd permanently.   A rough calculation using data from my most recent sims tends to suggest that in BiS gear our strikes plus DC dumps do about 5K dps.  So using a GCD do to an extra DC would have to do about 7.5K damage to even be considered as worth it.  (given your average damage cycle is top heavy).  The DC + UB hits for about 7.15K damage.  So it's a small loss (but that was without morbidity).  (With full morbidity it comes out at a win).   Of course that assumes the RP would be wasted otherwise.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Delaying runes is generally bad, but there are beneficial occasions. You can delay them for a DC, when you're a maximum rp. Saving your D rune pair exclusively for a SS is also worth it. I just tested that with a modified sim.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I don't see how it could be worth it. If you wait 1 extra GCD to use your two D runes then you are bring the first D rune out of the two second rule. This means you have to wait 3 seconds more to use your blood strike on the next rotation. If the runic power was going to be lost due to going overcap if you didn't use them then maybe it would be a DPS gain, but if not then I don't see it being a DPS gain. Maybe theres something I am missing.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

You never reapply diseases at the 15s mark, you juggle them in the 18s - 21s window, depending on the previous disease used you will get the 18s tick from one, refresh the one that did the 18s tick, then automatically the 21s will tick from the other due to it being 1.5s apart, this method also allows quick refresh times on diseases.<br>

</div>I think the question is more, where do you get the unholy rune from ?<br>
<br>
I haven't checked it yet, so maybe the rune is back up in 18 seconds, but i generally find that when my frost rune comes back up, FF is on 1 sec and my unholy rune i still on cooldown.<br>
<br>
Let me show you what i mean:<br>
<br>
<table class="stg_table tborder"><tbody><tr class="alt2"><td>t=</td><td>Rune type</td><td>Ability</td><td>Back up at t=</td></tr><tr class="alt1"><td>0</td><td>F</td><td>IT</td><td>10</td></tr><tr class="alt2"><td>1.5</td><td>U</td><td>PS</td><td>11.5</td></tr><tr class="alt1"><td>3-10</td><td>-</td><td>Other strikes</td><td>-</td></tr><tr class="alt2"><td>10</td><td>F</td><td>Hold for U rune</td><td>-</td></tr><tr class="alt1"><td>11.5</td><td>U</td><td>Scourge strike</td><td>F at 20; U at 21.5</td></tr></tbody></table><!-- table generated by StG's vB Code [table] v.0.1.6.0 (stable) o.95 --><br>
And this is the problem i see.<br>
I do the normal SS&gt;SS&gt;SS rotation between the 10 to 20 second mark.<br>
<br>
After that the frost rune comes back up at 20 seconds, but there is no unholy rune available until 21.5.<br>
<br>
That means that either:<br>
1) You are skipping the last scourge strike and use that blood rune<br>
2) You refresh PS at t=21.5 second, since it started at t=1.5, its on the 20 second mark and 1 second from the last tick and 2 seconds after the previous tick. Which also means you lose out a few seconds on frost fever<br>
3) Your general rotation is delayed. Because that's the only way i can see i can see that SS at t=11.5 have the 2 second leeway. It SHOULDN'T if your rotation is on the ball since the unholy rune hasn't been "waiting".<br>
4) I'm missing something very obvious.<br>
<br>
Please enlighten me though how you can use unholy rune before a frost rune when they come up in a different order.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I use empower rune weapon at the start on my first gargoyle to make up for the rp loss from summon to dc, this causes the unholy / frost runes that you would normally use to redisease to always refresh at the same time for the rest of the fight, allowing you to juggle.<br>
<br>
I didn't actually notice that till I just tested it on a dummy, since I always empower the same way on every fight.<br>
<br>
edit: Or like the poster below me posted, using a 2nd set set of runes to refresh that come up at the same time, I prefer creating my own ones with ERW, but that technique also gets the job done!<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1544732"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->actually i found this juggling much more convenient to do with the second set of UF runes rather than the deathrunes. Since the 2nd set is syncronised it doesnt matter if you PS or IT first, you are still not delaying, but in case of a parry/miss streak it doesnt totally mess up the rotation like when using deathrunes (using U/F rune instead of Deathrune bc it got ready before you could land the attack)<br>
<br>
So for me it looks like this:<br>
<br>
Starting Sequence:<br>
PS, IT, SS, BS, BS, DUMP, SS, IT, PS, SS, DUMP<br>
<br>
Following Sequence:<br>
<br>
SS, SS, BS, BS, DUMP, SS, PS, IT, SS, DUMP<br>

		<div id="post_message_1544842"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I also found the easiest way to do it by using ERW at the start, which I always do for the same reason as Potlol; there's no RP to dump after summoning Gargoyle. Using ERW makes the juggling possible without using your death runes for it, as the UF runes will come off CD at the same time.<br>
What can mess this up is a missed IT or a dodged PS, which make your U and F runes go out of sync. If that happens you need to switch the runes you use for reapplying diseases, or start clipping normally for the rest of the fight.<br>
Juggling gives your EP 100% uptime, but your BP drops off every second rotation, which is why you should clip normally when there's no other DK's present to gain the benefit from RoR.<br>
<br>
Starter:<br>
PS-IT-BS-BS-SS Gargoyle+ERW<br>
SS-SS-SS Dump<br>
<br>
Rotation:<br>
(IT&lt;-&gt;PS)-SS-BS-BS Dump<br>
SS-SS-SS Dump<br>
<br>
I'd like to see math on 1/2 Epidemic vs. disease juggling, but I'm guessing the latter is superior.<br>
Atleast with another Unholy DK present to keep EP and BP up, 1/2 Epidemic seems to win against the normal disease clipping rotation by ~40 DPS on the sim for me, but I don't know if it's possible to sim disease juggling, which is why I'd like to see some math on it.<br>
<br>
As we are able to soak RP on most of the fights, doesn't that make 12/0/59 with 2 points in Morbidity a better choice than 14/0/57? As the difference with <u>no extra RP</u> is only <u>a few DPS</u> on 14/0/57's favor.<br>
If your Druids are speccing into Revitalize, that would favor 12/0/59 even more. There's also the reduced CD on DnD, which doesn't really matter on ICC bosses, but is great for trash/adds and Anub. What are your thoughts and opinions on this and what is still keeping people using 14/0/57?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I've found PS-IT-BS-SS-BT/SS in the first rune set and SS-SS-BS-BS in the second rune set to be superior (or easier to manage) than the standard starter rotation. Using BT to move SS half a cycle foward effectively yields one extra SS every 2 minutes, instead of two extra BS. However, this is of course only possible with a Reaping-spec.<br>

</div>You are trading 20% Frost Fever damage and 1% crit for 15% DC+UB damage. For me 1% crit is about 60 dps, 5% DC damage is about 40 dps. Even if we assume they are equal, it's trading 20% FF damage for 10% DC+UB damage. On Festergut with a normal DC crit rate, 10% to DC+UB would be about 75 dps, while the 20% increase to FF equalled almost 90 dps. We didn't have a revitalize druid there, but it's still a 20-30 dps difference in favour of IT-glyph. Strangely I get the same results as you in the Team Robot simulator, but it doesn't seem right, at least as long as you don't have an external RP inflow from Revitalize / Rapture. Also, Epidemic-IT becomes significantly better once there is even the slightest form of AoE.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I'd like to see math on 1/2 Epidemic vs. disease juggling, but I'm guessing the latter is superior.<br>
Atleast with another Unholy DK present to keep EP and BP up, 1/2 Epidemic seems to win against the normal disease clipping rotation by ~40 DPS on the sim for me, but I don't know if it's possible to sim disease juggling, which is why I'd like to see some math on it.<br>
<br>
As we are able to soak RP on most of the fights, doesn't that make 12/0/59 with 2 points in Morbidity a better choice than 14/0/57? As the difference with <u>no extra RP</u> is only <u>a few DPS</u> on 14/0/57's favor.<br>
If your Druids are speccing into Revitalize, that would favor 12/0/59 even more. There's also the reduced CD on DnD, which doesn't really matter on ICC bosses, but is great for trash/adds and Anub. What are your thoughts and opinions on this and what is still keeping people using 14/0/57?</div>

</div>A rough calculation says that disease juggling/twisting is worth about 133 dps in good gear.  It's pretty easy to sim if you're using a rotation, you just need a double length rotation, and test with flipped vs unflipped diseases in the second half.  By that point the talents you could move the point into are all &lt; 80 dps talents.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>It really depends on rune timers and such, for a while I was getting my blood or death runes coming up as Bone Spikes came up and simply spread them with pest.  Usually I will try to pest and even use Blood Tap to do so.  If for whatever reason I can't get diseases on it, I will usually just BS once or twice and dump the RP with coils.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yeah that was my fear too.  I believe when the new SS was first announced and the resilience issue first raised that they said that it would double dip from things in our favour and not from negative things.  Of course that led to the insanity of double crits.  I can understand why they might want to make it consistent though.  In any case for most pve purposes the spell damage is a fixed multiplier of the physical damage.  If they were to nerf that multiplier you'd hope they'd just adjust the outbreak percentage to buff us back up.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1545994"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Ive run a few tests to see what talents exactly buff the shadow portion of SS.  Based upon my tests, I think I can safely say that Scourge Strike double dips from 5 abilities.<br>
<br>
We already know that it double dips from 1.) Blood Presence 2.) 2hand weap spec 3.) Desolation and 4.) Bone Shield but Im fairly certain it also gains benefit from <u>Rage of Rivendare</u>. <br>
<br>
What Scourge Strike is not double dipping from:<br>
1.) Ebon Plaguebringer (this isnt actually a candidate for double dipping, but Im including it because its not buffing the shadow portion of SS)<br>
2.) Outbreak<br>
3.) 2pc T10<br>
4.) 4pc T10<br>
<br>
Not tested: <br>
Black Ice<br>
<br>
Heres some screenshots.  I did the tests on lvl 80 training dummies and I used the <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100309152409/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=42082" target="_blank">[Relentless Gladiator's Cloak of Victory]</a> with a Spell Penetration enchant, +35, to try and prevent any potential resists.<br>

<br>
If the shadow portion of SS only double dips from Blood Presence, 2hand weap spec, Desolation, and Bone Shield (<u>Ill abbreviate these 4 things as "B2DB" from now on</u>), then the damage always comes up short.  <br>
<br>
Looking at the screenshots, here are the values we get:<br>

Actual SS physical portion damage = 116323 damage<br>
Projected Shadow portion damage calculated with only "B2DB" = ~111750<br>
Projected Shadow portion damage with RoR added to the double dip list = 111750 * 1.1 = <b>~122925</b><br>
<b>Actual Shadow portion damage = 122877</b><br>
<br>
2pc t10 screenshot:<br>
Actual SS physical portion damage = 139801<br>
Projected Shadow portion damage calculated with only "B2DB" = ~134305<br>
Projected Shadow portion damage with RoR added to the double dip list = 134305 * 1.1 = <b>~147735.5</b><br>

4pc t10 screenshot:<br>
Actual SS physical portion damage = 175643<br>
Projected Shadow portion damage calculated with only "B2DB" = ~168738<br>
Projected Shadow portion damage with RoR added to the double dip list = 168738 * 1.1 = <b>~185611.7</b><br>
<b>Actual Shadow portion damage = 185650</b><br>
<br>
With those values in mind, I think its safe to assume RoR is affecting the shadow portion of SS, <u>but Outbreak, 2pc t10, 4pc t10, and Ebon Plaguebringer definitely are not.</u><br>
<br>
I realize the tests were done on target dummies and the sample sizes are low (only 75 Scourge Strikes each test), but hopefully the numbers give us some further insight.  If anyone sees any inaccuracies in my numbers, please let me know.<br>
<br>
Edit: Also, if RoR affecting the shadow portion of SS is common knowledge, then my apologies.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Suffice is to say you're definitely making an error; simply unsure of where, exactly, said error lies. Your numbers work almost perfectly if you simply forgot to use Bone Shield, but I assume it isn't something that simple. At any rate:<ul><li>SS double dips into Bone Shield, Two Handed Weapon Specialization, Blood Presence, and Desolation.</li>
<li>It is affected by Ebon Plague (and Black Ice, if for some odd reason you specced it).</li>

On another note, although that screenshot was taken without 4p t10, quick testing with it shows that 4p t10 is <i>not</i> double-dipped. Which is odd, since I could have sworn it was, and since one would assume that due to it being no different than, say, Desolation or Arcane Empowerment that it would. But it most certainly is not.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Quoting GC's most recent post:<br>
<br>
<i>I'm not sure where the interpretation came from that we're going to nerf Scourge Strike for PvE. All I was trying to say was that the current 3.3 version of Scourge Strike seems to be working correctly for PvE but might be penalized too much by resilience in PvP. If that turns out to be the case, then you would see your Scourge Strike damage go up in PvP (assuming the target has some kind of resilience) and stay the same in PvE.<br>
<br>
I know we have changed this talent a lot, and I do apologize for any confusion. If you recall, not long ago Scourge Strike could crit independently. When we changed that, we removed some of its ability to double dip. A +damage ability should already affect the physical portion of the strike, so indirectly affects the Shadow portion of the strike. Abilities, most saliently Ebon Plague, that do not affect the physical damage can still boost Scourge Strike through the Shadow portion. Resilience, on the other hand, already reduces the physical damage done so indirectly affects the Shadow portion done. It should not further reduce the Shadow portion separately. We took steps to make sure that wasn't happening, so it it is indeed happening, something broke along the way. My apologies if that is the case. </i><br>

Thankfully, it looks unlikely that we'll be penalised for the current double-dipping behaviour if SS is changed, then.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

The only real area which I'm not certain on is the hit issue (which comes about due to the str Ashen Verdict ring. Nothing to do with the new weapons); alliance have to drop a slot worth of it somewhere. You can't drop gloves due to the set bonus (and picking up the legs will overcap your expertise). Dropping bracers would be too large a loss, as there's no other 277 plate bracers (although the crit/arp leather bracers might be an option, now that I think about it). That leaves cloak/ring. Cloak is the better option between the two, despite it being crit/haste, as you're going up in ilvl and thus gaining str.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1547511"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Glove enchant, icewalker, and then a str/hit gem or two. Most optimal way to do it. For alliance, anyways, which was what it was aimed at.<br>
<br>
If horde, you simply swap the cloak for the 10m TotGC cloak, or the neck for the 25m normal Deathwhisper neck. Off the top of my head, I'm not entirely sure which is the better trade off, although it's (highly) likely the neck. I can make note of it similar to how I made note of the difference in cloaks for alliance/horde with the other sets.<br>
<br>
Edit: To that one post I accidently skipped over; I could add a "normal 10m only set" or "normal + hard 10m only set", of course. It would be very easy to calculate and wouldn't be a hassle at all. The reason why I haven't bothered to look into such things and add them is that I simply can't see how valuable such lists would be. <br>
<br>
How many people do 10 mans and <i>only</i> 10 mans? Perhaps a person is in a "strict" 10 man guild, but they don't occasionally join the 25m TotC pug? Or perhaps just do Marrowgar as he's a joke and his weapon is better than any (normal) 10 man weapon? Toravon for the easy 264 tier? Focusing on 10ms is understandable, but never ever dabbling in 25s? <br>
<br>
Perhaps I'm just ignorant of the playstyle, and if so I certainly apologize, but I can't imagine there are many players who just completely ignore 25 man content <i>completely</i>, which is what any such item list would be assuming.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

All other stats are identical (and can thus be cancelled out from EAP) and Endless Might wins.

You can either get 20 hit on gloves, or downgrade 2 20 str gems to 2 10 str 10 hit gems.<br>
<br>
So you need to consider the kind of gear you're wearing.<br>
<br>
If you have no yellow socket that will give you +4 str, 20 hit on gloves and red gems will give you 20 hit and 40 str; while 15 str on gloves and yellow gems will give you 35 str and 20 hit; 20 hit is the clear winner here.<br>
<br>
If you have 1 yellow socket that will give you +4 str, you would get 39 str and 20 hit again, thus making 20 hit the enchant to go for.<br>
<br>
If you have 2 yellow sockets that will give you +4 str, you will get 43 str and 20 hit using yellow gems, so it's better to enchant +15 str in that case.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Get the glove enchant.<br>
<br>
If you gem for the hit you swap 20 strength for 20 hit. If you use the glove enchant you get 20 hit at the loss of 15 strength (second best option for gloves).<br>

<br>
In the end to get your ghoul hit capped as alliance, you're trading strength, crit or any other stat for hit past the melee cap, to boost your pet (10% of your dps) damage by 1%.<br>

</div>Understood, but Unholy isn't stacking expertise to cap. So, unlike hit, gaining that expertise isn't going to allow you to change, for example, a ring with crit and expertise, for a ring with crit and armor pen. Even without the weapon, changing this ring would be a DPS gain. In fact, I would worry more about gaining too much expertise from taking the sword because any expertise over the soft cap is absolutely worthless (i.e. 0 APE), thus increasing the gap between the two weapons.<br>
<br>
I'm not saying that the BiS list is "wrong", I'm simply raising a point that the polearm may be slightly better for some than the sword.<br>
<br>
Another thing to note is that nobody seems to have determined just how much expertise is required for Unholy. Since we have extra GCDs in our rotation it's not nearly as vital as, for example, blood. If I'm not mistaken, our rune cooldowns, 2/2 epidemic, and 3/3 reaping give us 2 extra GCDs per rotation. This would indicate that we need only enough expertise to have no more than 2 of our special abilities dodged per rotation on average or we start to see a significant DPS loss.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>It's completely accurate when describing the basic rotation. Those 'extra gcds' are the time that should be used to perform any of the maintenance/utility tasks you mentioned; HoW, BT/BS, AMS, etc, but when I'm at the top of my game and executing perfectly, I quite frequently find time when I have all my runes on CD, BS is up, HoW and AMS are on CD and I'm out of RP then I just wait, and I'm only running 18 expertise. It is this downtime that puts expertise at such a low APE value. This isn't a new idea and it's been discussed at length in this thread and I'm not disagreeing with the previous conclusions at all.<br>
<br>
What I am saying, is that there is logic behind the idea that the 284 polearm may be slightly better itemized than the 284 2H sword. Whatever your side of the argument, it's close enough that a player may choose one over the other for reasons other than one being a greater DPS boost than the other, such as if the polearm drops first, or the sword would put someone over expertise cap (humans esp), or someone doesn't find having an ability dodged here or there annoying, or even if somebody likes the flavor text or model of the polearm better, it's not going to be a major loss over waiting for the sword.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Hmm, very good point, I should perhaps have a little talk with our resto druids <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100227100046im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt="" title=";)" class="inlineimg"> I appreciate the personal analysis. Revitalize aside though, that was an awful kill, an exercise in Murphy's Law, on my part and others. I was almost hoping for a wipe so I could not screw up so bad the second time.<br>
<br>
Yes, the comment about the model was absurd, and kind of meant to be that way. If anything I'm trying to spur some discussion on the itemization of the Lich King weapons, and on expertise in particular which seems to be an area of discussion that hasn't had enough attention paid to. Specifically, "how much expertise is enough?" and now I'm thinking about how much does the value of expertise when enough RP is being generated to fill all GCDs with maintenance abilities and DCs.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

i'll suggest to take legs and hands for expertise and hit on them<br>
<br>
i'm pretty sure none dk dps had focused on that to test it so...<br>
or maybe it will be always better to stay on 4pT9 for heavy aoe fights<br>
<br>
what do you think ?</div>

</div>This isn't so hard to calculate, let's standardize using Anub parses with none of the mentioned set bonusses in action:<br>
<blockquote><table class="stg_table tborder"><tbody><tr class="alt2"><td>Ability</td></tr><tr class="alt1"><td>Death &amp; Decay</td></tr><tr class="alt2"><td>Blood Plague</td></tr><tr class="alt1"><td>Frost Fever</td></tr></tbody></table><!-- table generated by StG's vB Code [table] v.0.1.6.0 (stable) o.95 --><table class="stg_table tborder"><tbody><tr class="alt2"><td>avg %</td></tr><tr class="alt1"><td>~20%</td></tr><tr class="alt2"><td>~15%</td></tr><tr class="alt1"><td>~15%</td></tr></tbody></table><!-- table generated by StG's vB Code [table] v.0.1.6.0 (stable) o.95 --></blockquote>Now before comparing stats on the tiers themselves lets calculate the value in an AoE fight:<br>
<br>
4pc T10: 100% x 3% = <b>3% total damage increase</b><br>
<br>
2pc Tank T10: 20% x 20% = <b>4% total damage increase</b><br>
<br>
4pc T9: 15% x ~50% = <b>7,5% total damage increase</b><br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Conclusion:</b> T10[277] &gt; T9[258] &gt; T9[245] &gt; T10[264] &gt; T10[251] &gt; T10Tank<br>
<br>

My topic today does not deal with anything i've read on these forums before, but perhaps has been addressed prior...I could not find any information on the subject so if someone more knowledgeable knows the answer, I'd be happy to hear it.<br>
<br>
Comparing 2 parses, the first is mine and the second is the other unholy dk in my guild, we have similar gear but that really has nothing to do with it.  Basically my question concerns the gargoyle and how it chooses rather to melee or gargoyle strike and if you can prevent it from melee'ing. <br>
<br>

<br>
As you can see, on this particular fight - 25m Saurfang - his gargoyle did 4 more gargoyle strikes and melee'd 4 less times, for ~19000 more overall damage.  Now granted this isn't a huge difference, but it is a difference nonetheless and I play this game on min/max mode.  Also note for some reason my gargoyle lasted for 26 seconds rather than 30.<br>
<br>
*edit* After posting this I also went to a dummy in SW and ran my regular rotation on it, gargoyle didn't melee a single time.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1549026"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I am very interested in this development as well.  I was comparing two of my parses where on Deathbringer I did about 10k dps but then on Festergut where I normally do more dps I was down to 9500 dps.  One thing I noted was on the Festergut fight my Gargoyle did 26 melee hits.  Where as on Deathbringer he did only 3.  Very odd as I never really payed attention to this before.<br>

</div>The thing about ARP is that it scales heavily with how much you already have. Looking at your setup, you are currently gemmed primarily into ARP already, which could possibly be why it is giving you such a high EP value. EDIT: just ran the sim for myself, I think you may have something set wrong in your EP sim, I just ran the sim with your current stats from armory and got:<br>
<br>
EP AttackPower | 1 (0.68 DPS/per AP)  <br>
EP Strength | 2.94 <br>
EP Agility | 1.32 <br>
EP CritRating | 1.88 <br>
EP HasteEstimated | 0.03 <br>
EP HasteRating1 | 2.71 <br>
EP ArmorPenetrationRating | 2.35 <br>
EP ExpertiseRating | 2.12 <br>
BeforeMeleeHitCap&lt;8% | 1.68 <br>
EP SpellHitRating | 0 <br>
EP WeaponDPS | 7.21 <br>
EP WeaponSpeed | 338.24 <br>
I ran a quick sim just to get a general idea, since I'm on a work computer at the moment, some values may be slightly off, I'll run a full length one in a min.<br>
<br>
I did a DPS sim as well to see if the results match up, with your current ARP gem setup it is showing:<br>
DPS| 9289 <br>
Total Damage| 334.41m | in 10h <br>
<br>
I replaced all your ARP gems with STR gems and got:<br>
DPS| 9594 <br>
Total Damage| 345.39m | in 10h <br>
<br>
It could possibly be an incorrect rotation setting in your sim that is giving you the incorrect numbers, or the simulation time you are using is throwing off the numbers (if it is too short).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
I'm not going to post 10 or so links here, though you can browse basically all my logs through the guild calendar on WMO <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100227100046/http://www.wowmeteronline.com/browse/guildcalendar/7536/2010/01#calendar" target="_blank">Draconic Savant on WMO</a> I should be in just about every log there.<br>
<br>
There's numerous cases of gargoyle values being all over the place.  Here's the best two examples:<br>
<br>
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100227100046/http://www.wowmeteronline.com/combat/detail/305852372#damageout" target="_blank">WoW Meters Online - Combatlog Replay</a> - 24 ranged attacks, 2 melee.<br>

<br>
Around a 40k damage difference.  Pretty damn significant really, especially when you consider the overall damage done by things like Unholy Blight, BCB, or Blood Strike for the sake of comparisons.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I noticed this a few week back and spent a few hours trying to figure out how to avoid this but it's quite tricky as it turns out. Size of the hitbox seem to affect it. <br>
<br>
On a small hitbox like the target dummy or Saurfang it will mostly be a none issue. You can now and then have it get another cast of by summoning it close to the center of the hitbox, opposed to max melee range. Summoning at this position would, in my tests, 90% of the time lead to the gargoyle melee hitting just as it spawned and then fly out to range. If I summoned to far out and it would fly in, melee and then fly out, losing one cast (with the haste I had during testing). Only way to avoid the melee hit at all on a small hitbox had me run far far (15 or so yard) out of melee losing 1+ autoattacks or more.<br>
<br>
On larger hitboxes it gets even tricker since the gargoyle seem to focus on the center of the hitbox and never fly far enough out to not be able to melee it.<br>
<br>
I have given up trying to get the perfect gargoyle summoning of on all but Prof. Putricide pull. We usually pull him a short distance from the table where I get to start hitting him until he spawns the first puddles. As the tank moves him away from these is the perfect time to summon and have it only cast without getting melee hits.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">So I obtained my 2-piece T10 last night and have been testing with the Reaping build. If my melee DMG is still above SS DMG does that mean that i do not have the gear requirements for the Reaping build yet? As i read that SS should be the top DMG attack for a reaping build. I am using the exact rotation listed on the main page and the reaping build from it also.</div>

</div>I too am curious about this. I had spec'd into reaping and was using a 2p T10 and 2P T9 setup. My melee dmg was higher then my SS dmg on Saurfang. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100227100046/http://www.wowmeteronline.com/combat/detail/299367064#damageout" target="_blank">WoW Meters Online - Combatlog Replay</a><br>
<br>
My thinking is that even with 2P T10, it doesn't become worthwhile to spec into reaping until you've reached a certain ArmPen rating. (For the above log I believe I was at about 24% armpen) What the magic armpen number is when it becomes worth while to switch from 4p T9 into 2P T10 and reaping I don't know. Apologies, I know assumptions are frowned upon here. Doing the math is something I don't even pretend to know how to approach. <br>
<br>
Any guidance, or realignment in thinking, would be greatly appreciated here. <br>
<br>
Couple more notes, I'm on a mac so running something like DK gear optimizer isn't an option. My current armory does not reflect what I was wearing during the above log.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I noticed this too and after about 5 minutes of testing I believe that it can at least be attributed to no longer proccing off disease application or refresh. Before 3.3.2 but after the hotfix that took away scourge strike double procs it was most definitely proccing off disease application/refresh. This is no longer the case. As for the actual PPM, I have no idea if it's been changed.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>You can't test Bryntroll accurately on a dummy since the proc is flat, and not affected by buffs in a raid, therefore it will be a higher % of your total damage done, what you can test though, is the procrate.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I tested two ways (for the disease application). One was to use endless winter and spam chains of ice. The other was to use icy touch about a second after a melee swing. So this really only tests frost fever, but I would assume if frost fever doesn't work, neither would blood plague. This doesn't mean that plague strike would no longer work, but it would mean that you no longer get 2 chances from plague strike via the strike+disease. It seems like blizz just wants it to proc off physical attacks.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

If these changes stay, then I assume this is Blizzards way of forcing us to move on from proc weapons like Nibelung and Bryntroll. Oh well, suppose this just gives me more incentive to farm 25 saronites now.  <br>
<br>
But honestly, I don't think this will have a substantial effect on our dps due to the relatively low number of times were cast our diseases during a fight. Not sure how I would go about calculating that, but based on what i think was removed from possible procs, here is what we lost:<br>
<br>
In any given minute of where we apply disease every 20 seconds, we lost 3 chances from BP application, 3 chances from IT, and 3 chances from FF application. So in total, 9 procs per minute. However, at only a ~11% proc rate, we're only looking at an average of 1-2 procs lost per minute. Please correct me if I'm wrong, which would not surprise me in the slightest.  <br>
<br>
edit- Okay, did a test just now to see if Plague Strike would proc Drain Life, and it does appear as though it does. All I did was use PS, and when I saw Drain Life proc, I checked my combat log. Usually, it was a melee attack that proc'd it, but there were several instances where the PS itself would proc the Drain Life. So, the application of BP, IT, and the application of FF have been removed. Meh<br>
<br>
edit 2-@Archnoel: I did the same test, with no Drain Life procs. However, I'm still wondering if DL would proc anyway if we're positioning ourselves so that melee strikes can't occur. Honestly, I've never paid much attention to the actual behavior of the proc. Without me knowing if it follows the same melee rules, i.e. facing, positioning, etc, I'm still unsure as to whether or not this proc removal is real or not. But, without a doubt, at least the strike portion of PS proc's it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

My thinking is that even with 2P T10, it doesn't become worthwhile to spec into reaping until you've reached a certain ArmPen rating. (For the above log I believe I was at about 24% armpen) What the magic armpen number is when it becomes worth while to switch from 4p T9 into 2P T10 and reaping I don't know.

</div>As you seem to know, the real way to know is to sim &amp; find out for sure.  The point at which to swap to reaping won't be something so simple as "get X ArP, then go reaping."  The easiest way to explain it is when the damage of 1 SS is far enough ahead of 2xBS to make up for the points you'll be moving to pick up reaping. This is a pretty simplified litmus test, since there are a few other factors such as the extra gcd per rotation (for example; reaping will gain value if you're getting a lot of RP from revitalize), so this isn't the ultimate solution, but it's a way to get a rough idea.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Just looking at your logs you have 44 scourge strikes used and 48 blood strikes used. In a normal rotation your SS-BS ratio should be 2:1. Yours is more like 1:1. In an ideal rotation, you would have 54 SS and 28 BS for the same amount of runes. This would take SS from being 17.4% of your damage to being about 21.3% of your damage which would put SS above melee in your overall damage done.<br>
<br>
So probably you are sometimes using BS-BS on the second half of your roation instead of SS which will have an associated reduction in SS as a percentage of your overall damage and with it an associated reduction in the relative value of the 2-piece T10 bonus. This is the area where theory collides with practice, a simulator never messes up its rotation whereas real people do and in some fights maintaining a perfect rotation just isn't practical.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>While this method does work, you will still have to refresh your diseases at some point. In a typical 20 second rotation, you would need to SS at least 7 times in order to never have your diseases fall off. This also means you would have to pestilence at least 2 times, occasionally 3, in order to achieve the extended duration on your diseases for each SS. This is obviously impossible, barring using ERW to achieve this rotation.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1550172"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Since you need to Pestilence anyways to abuse GoSS in this way, there is not way this could be better then just using GoD, unless you can roll disease coefficients with GoSS in this way. <br>
Some tissue math, assuming it does roll coefficients:<br>
To maintain it you would need 1pest every three SS though, making a reaping spec unpractical. When going Pest-&gt;BS-&gt;SS-&gt;SS-&gt;Dump-&gt;Repeat you lose 4s worth of diseases every 10s on average, requiring you to hard refresh eventually.  Ignoring that you would need to hard refresh, you trade 1BS/20s vs the standard GoD spec. Going by my numbers from the last Festergut kill, my diseaes tick for an average of 2150/1750 with a fully buffed maximum of 2700/2300. So assuming Ideal conditions where you can maintain fully buffed diseases this is a 1100dmg gain per 3s or 7333dmg per 20s which is about 1.3k more then my average blood strike. An DPS increase of ~65dps under ideal conditions over a GoD spec, which is worse then the GoDD spec.<br>
However in an AoE heavy situation and using 4t9 this might pull ahead of GoD, if GoSS rolls coefficients, I will definetly test this on Anub'Arak this week.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

But just doing a heroic now clearly shows it procs way less. Before the heroic I've had it doing all up to 18% of the total damage done on some fights. Now i can barely break 5% in any fight.

</div>Regardless, I assure the results are the same. I was using and icy touch/stopattack macro previously for testing but the occasional melee would still get off. There were no drain life procs from disease applications on those tests either. (checked combat logs after each proc from a stay melee swing to just be sure of its origin) <br>
<br>
The data I presented was essentially the same data minus the melee swings. I didn't think it would've been taken kindly to if I had posted 100 individual log segments.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>As I said: major problem is in single-target situations. So the crap about the numbers of SS's needed to maintain a rotation that I am well aware of wasn't required.<br>
<br>
And in multiple target situations switching to P targets then P to switch back to your main target would seem normal to any Deathknight. Don't make me say what I didn't and don't try to interpret please.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Since you need to Pestilence anyways to abuse GoSS in this way, there is not way this could be better then just using GoD, unless you can roll disease coefficients with GoSS in this way. <br>
Some tissue math, assuming it does roll coefficients:<br>
To maintain it you would need 1pest every three SS though, making a reaping spec unpractical. When going Pest-&gt;BS-&gt;SS-&gt;SS-&gt;Dump-&gt;Repeat you lose 4s worth of diseases every 10s on average, requiring you to hard refresh eventually.  Ignoring that you would need to hard refresh, you trade 1BS/20s vs the standard GoD spec. Going by my numbers from the last Festergut kill, my diseaes tick for an average of 2150/1750 with a fully buffed maximum of 2700/2300. So assuming Ideal conditions where you can maintain fully buffed diseases this is a 1100dmg gain per 3s or 7333dmg per 20s which is about 1.3k more then my average blood strike. An DPS increase of ~65dps under ideal conditions over a GoD spec, which is worse then the GoDD spec.<br>
However in an AoE heavy situation and using 4t9 this might pull ahead of GoD, if GoSS rolls coefficients, I will definetly test this on Anub'Arak this week.</div>

</div>GoSS does roll coefficients - which is the entire point for AoE. Switching targets and applying SS's to lengthen the disease rolling might be slightly complicated in a real situation though.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

However in a true AE situation (like Anub) there won't be a lot of runes available for SS since you also DnD. The only encounter that springs to my mind where you permanently have a secondary target, but don't want to DnD is Twins.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>At lvl 80 1% crit = 45.91 crit rating. so you would be giving up 91.82 crit rating worth of stats.<br>
<br>
In that level of gear 1 crit rating is worth 2.16 AP so that would be an effective loss of 198.3 AP. With 1 AP being equal to 0.93 dps that is a DPS loss of 184.4 DPS.<br>
<br>
So lets assume, in that gear you are doing 8k DPS. That would mean you lose 2.3% of your DPS. To make it back you would have to have 2.3% more time DPSing on the boss thanks to the run speed than you would without it. Since the run speed is 15% increased that means you would have to be spending 2.3 / 0.15 = 15% of the fight running between adds doing no damage to make back the DPS you lose when you get there. In short, even on highly mobile fights it probably isnt worth it. Of course if you don't currently have a DPS enchant on your feet you can make back about half the stat loss, but then you would be giving up a run speed enchant so the gain would also be halved making it pretty much the same numbers.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1552103"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->It should also be important to note on movement that the 15% increased runspeed does not directly translate to the decrease in runtime*DPS. You can use IT on the run, and is quite optimal if you are switching to a target with no diseases. Furthermore, your pet also makes up a portion of your DPS, and the ghoul can use leap to significantly decrease its run time between mobs. <br>

As Diello stated, there isn't really a right or wrong answer for specing into IUP, but it's important to realize that the calculation for runspeed is not quite as simple as previously stated.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1552274"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Last week, for experimental purposes, I moved 2 points from Dark Conviction to 2 in Improved Unholy Presence in order to see the differences. For normal modes, the result was rather underwhelming. The fights that need a lot of movements are not difficult ones so far in Icecrown Citadel. Perhaps when hard modes or achievements factors come in. Such as Full House and Putricide's.<br>
<br>
In comparison, the 2 points in Morbidity seems to be a much greater investment than Dark Conviction (or Improved Unholy Presence). It has a huge usage return in investment for Valithria, although that fight isn't too difficult, it is also useful for Sindragosa's tombs, and Lich King. For guilds who still do Anub'arak 25 hard mode, it goes without saying that it is priceless there.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Starting with the last first. Basically using PS first is best because you get Rage of Rivendare going straight away. However if you start at range (Marrowgar / Festergut / Rotface / BQL / etc) you best start with icy touch.<br>
Then again for dps this can mess up your disease timers a bit, but I generally time IT to land just before i can put up PS.<br>
<br>
As for ERW.<br>
<br>
I have recently been experimenting with the disease juggling that Potlol (and a few others) were mentioning a few posts back: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100304081521/http://elitistjerks.com/f72/t72364-unholy_dps_3_3_2_according_you/p97/#post1544510" target="_blank">http://elitistjerks.com/f72/t72364-u...7/#post1544510</a><br>
<br>
And i have to say im positively surprised by how effective this is. Not only do you get an extra disease tick every 20 seconds. You also pretty much eliminate the bad timing the normal rotation has. In a normal rotation you reapply diseases 0-1 second before it runs out, meaning that you have 5-6 seconds without a single disease tick.<br>
It seems that juggling diseases this way results in a pretty noticeable advantage. Assuming your diseases do about 12% of your total dps, and this technique gives you 2 extra ticks every rotation. That means a 16.67% increase in disease damage or a 2% dps increase.<br>
<br>
The juggling either requires you to adjust your rotation, or use the ERW methode that Potlol described. I tried the ERW method since I always found I personally wasn't getting the max out of ERW, and this could be a good way to solve that.<br>
<br>
Basically my rotation becomes:<br>
IT&gt;PS&gt;SS&gt;BS&gt;BS&gt; Gargoyle &gt; ERW<br>
SS&gt;SS&gt;DC&gt;SS&gt;DC<br>
<br>
After this the runes for IT and PS come up at the exact same time. I'll refresh PS when the timer dips below 3 seconds, and then IT right after that (should have just run out). And the next i'll do it the other way around.<br>
<br>
For AoE I tend to save ERW for when it really packs a punch, or when it's really needed. And i think i do it pretty much the same way you do, only i try to use it this way after ERW: BS&gt;SS&gt;BB&gt;SS<br>
That way when the runes come back up the ones for DnD are paired up, and a blood rune comes up first so i can pestilence first (just inside the disease timer).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I was wondering when to use ERW the most effectively for a Reaping spec.  At the moment I use it like this for a single target situation (Most of the time at the start of the fight with as many procs running as possible);<br>

One thing that I noticed right off that bat is that you have 2 Blood strikes at the very end of your rotation.<br>
You should be dumping your excess rp, then refreshing your diseases, then using the blood strikes to refresh desolation and your death runes.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Starting with the last first. Basically using PS first is best because you get Rage of Rivendare going straight away. However if you start at range (Marrowgar / Festergut / Rotface / BQL / etc) you best start with icy touch.<br>
Then again for dps this can mess up your disease timers a bit, but I generally time IT to land just before i can put up PS.</div>

	</tbody></table>
</div>I disagree with starting your initial rotation with an Icy Touch as this means you have your first application not affected by RoR.  In a situation where melee starts out with some runtime to get to the boss, I'll use a DC while I am running.  I have yet to see a boss where there is time for 2 GCD's before you can get into position.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1552836"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->First of all, thank you! <br>
You people have built an astounding thread here and I come and read on regular basis. <br>
Please keep up the good work.<br>
<br>
Ok. Now to something completely different...my inquire has to do with Deathbringer Saurfang. <br>
<br>
Normally when the Blood Beasts spawn I cast Pestilence (both 10 and 25) in order to spread the disease and thus enable the casters to bring down the beasts more quickly. <br>
However, I was asked not to do it since it "attracts" the Blood Beasts to the Melee camp (!?). <br>
Is this true? Does Pestilence generate a high amount of threat?<br>
 <br>
I hope somebody can help me decide the right course of action for this encounter regarding Pestilence (any other advice would be greatly appreciated). <br>
<br>
Note: its not that we havent killed Deathbringer Saurfang...I am just curious about the right course of action.<br>
<br>

</div>Thanks for the answers...and as the story goes, answers yield more questions. <br>
<br>
If I read all of the above and "combine"...does this mean (due to the resistance of diseases) that the "actual" benefit from the Ebon Plague ends up being "only" 3.9% (70% resistance from 13%) on the Blood Beasts? Or have I just exposed my ignorance?<br>
Why is this important? <br>
I suppose in the Normal version it can be set aside, but with the upcoming Hard Modes I assume every bit of dmg counts. <br>
If its "only" 3,9% on the Blood Beasts wouldnt be better to go Blood (speaking of 10 Raid) and thus give AM to the Raid (25 of course 2 DKs (at least) Blood &amp; Unholy).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

When I had initially done the Sims I had messed something up and was getting skewed results. Someone was kind enough to help me with it and reaping showed to be a bit behind non reaping at the time. After quite a few upgrades and gaining 4pc I ran the sim earlier and it showed reaping to be almost 250 dps behind non reaping. Now I'm going to chalk this up to be being inept in running the sim again unless it's really possible even at 4pc with a bunch of 264 offsets that reaping still hasn't surpassed non reaping.

</div>The Unholy DPS priority system is not rocket surgery. No, there is no way to get even close to the same DPS using a castsequence-macro, since RP-generation / rune cooldown resets don't follow a perfect order (i.e. you don't always have x RP every y seconds / minutes). Since I figure that most posts asking for castsequence-macros have been shitheaped there actually is a realistic chance that you searched the thread and didn't find anything - so let it be said once and for all: <b>castsequence macros suck and cannot possibly perform even close  to good play.</b> If your guildmate can't be bothered to press 5 buttons in an order that even a newborn chimpanzee could manage you might want to look for a new one. Something being "on farm" usually implies that it dies faster, not that it dies slower because people think they can be lazy and / or stupid.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1553958"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I've stated a few times that from a logical perspective it's most efficient to use BT to move your death rune SS one rotation up. That way you gain one SS every two minutes instead of 2 BS.<br>
<br>
So basically your initial rotation becomes<br>
PS-IT-BS-BT/SS-SS<br>
SS-SS-BS-BS<br>
<br>
You continue with<br>
PS-IT-SS-SS<br>
SS-SS-BS-BS<br>
<br>
until the BT cooldown is up again and switch back to<br>
PS-IT-SS-SS<br>
SS-SS-BS-BT/SS<br>
<br>
and then again until the next BT<br>
PS-IT-SS-BS-BS<br>
SS-SS-SS<br>
<br>
This exploits the fact that if you use BT when you just used BS (so that one death rune is on CD) and your second blood rune is up, the death rune CD is reset and you blood rune turns into a death rune, such that you have two death runes to use immediately.<br>
<br>
As for Bone Shield: If you cast it right at the start of the encounter, most encounters in ICC are either dead before the 5 minutes have passed  or there is some time during the encounter where you can't dps anyways and just recast the shield then.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">As I've experienced the gargoyle chooses to melee for the first few seconds after it's been summon if it spawns right on top of the boss. So basically the only way to avoid this is to summon while the boss is being moved as the gargoyle will spawn about where the boss was during summoning. Of course, that's not always possible and I guess it's probably a DPS loss to wait until the boss is being moved instead of summoning with trinket / runeforge procs up.</div>

</div>Gargoyle is one of the only cooldowns available as an unholy death knight which makes it that much more important, and when your main cooldown loses a large amount of damage due to it using its melee attacks on the target, it can be detrimental to your overall dps. Fortunately, there is a way to avoid your gargoyle from being summoned in melee range which allows it to cast freely and reach its fullest potential with no loss to your own personal dps. <br>
<br>
When you actually summon the gargoyle, you will notice it is actually flown down about 10-15 yards in front of you. SO, if you were to turn around 180 degrees and summon it then, it will actually fly down a good distance behind you, and since you should be behind the boss in the first place, this puts it at a perfect ranged position far from melee range. I have personally tested this several times and in each case it hasn't used a single melee attack on the target.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

The value of crit tapers off the more of it you have and eventually they will pull even. I prefer morbidity simply due to its utility on aoe fights and high movement fights where I can dump death coils on the move to maximise GCD usage. For crit levels around ~1.1k and down, dark conviction is better on a patchwerk type encounter.

</div>Gemming hit in itself is never a good thing. As itemlevel goes up, str goes up in a similar fashion. The trade off should never be str v hit (like it is when gemming), but more so hit v haste or hit v exp (for example). Unless you choose low level items because of their hit, then gemming hit isn't a good thing, but an unfortunate necessity.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Not exactly, if you're using gemming optimally then most of the time you're actually swapping the non-strength part of an orange gem in a yellow socket from crit or haste to hit rating when you'd still be going for the socket bonus anyway.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Anyways, two Bryntroll notes: On top of the application of debuffs no longer having a chance to proc, Blood-Caked Blade no longer appears to as well. I'm not exactly sure how recent this change is or isn't, but I'm fairly positive it didn't coincide with the SS change, so it's more likely from the same time as the debuff change. Disheartening regardless. Secondly, the heroic version appears to have the same proc rate (2PPM, or ~11.333%) as the normal version, as expected.<br>
<br>
Testing:<br>

(Still hitting away at the dummy, but I figure this is a large enough sample size)<br>
<br>
77/666 = 11.561%<br>
<br>
Suffice is to say that, of the 277 weapons, Bryntroll heroic is the worst and of the 264 weapons, Bryntroll normal is the worst.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Are you taking into account the glove and boot enchants? For alliance toons, that will put you at 233 hit(20 from gloves, 12 from boots) which is just above hit cap. Horde will have a bit different gear setup(but that was already known), but even so they can eat hit food to push them up to 273. <br>
<br>
Now, doing a quick count, I got 194 hit for the ally setup, and 251 as horde. Ally can grab the boot and glove enchant to bring them up to 226, then use one of their yellow sockets for str/hit to go up to 236.

		<div id="post_message_1556895"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->As others already pointed out, gemming for hit can be done at a loss of 1 crit to 1 hit by using a str/hit orange gem in a yellow socket where it would otherwise be optimal to use a str/crit orange gem. It's just a simple opportunity cost that you can easily calculate by weighing that lost critical strike rating against whatever else you gain by dropping a hit rating piece of gear for something with better stats.<br>
<br>
That said, with the current stat weights a horde DK would gain roughly 8 dps using <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100305012006/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=50180" target="_blank">[Lana'thel's Chain of Flagellation]</a> over <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100305012006/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=50180" target="_blank">[Lana'thel's Chain of Flagellation]</a> even on the pre-heroic 25 man best in slot list. Though if expertise turns out to be overvalued for some reason that will obviously not be true. Using Lana'thel's and switching 5 str/crit gems to str/hit, you stay over 8% melee hit and have 3 yellow slots still being used by str/crit gems to spare. This is a good example of why using many hit gems can sometimes be optimal.<br>
<br>
In the same vein, using the best in slot list it would seem optimal for a horde DK to use <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100305012006/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=50677" target="_blank">[Winding Sheet]</a> over <a id="itemlink" class="q4" style=" font-weight: bold;" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100305012006/http://www.wowhead.com/?item=47548" target="_blank">[Garrosh's Rage]</a>, and switch to the precision and icewalker enchants with 3 str/hit gems. The gain would be on the order of 25 dps using the OP's stat weights.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1556936"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->As others have noted, I've seen the lack of expertise on the "BiS" lists. I understand the value is not as high as other stats. However, those are down around 15 expertise in game. I currently run with 20 and it's not terrible although this is the first time since early naxx where I haven't been capped or close too. Just curious if those lists truly are accurate in their placement of expertise. Free GCDs is great, but at that low a level, wouldn't you run a fairly high chance of getting double dodged/parried and sooner or later we'll run out of GCDs. The sword of LK would obviously fix any and all of these issues, but with Shadowmourne the issues are still present.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1556978"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The problem with expertise is that it's not trivial to calculate its value and how to interpret it. To explain this, just look at stats like haste, armor penetration or crit. The benefit of haste can be almost perfectly predicted, since it only affects our white ad ghoul damage. Same with armor penetration, although it depends on the different crit rates on your physical attacks compared to your spell attacks, but over time this evens out and the variance isn't that terribly high to begin with. Crit rating is also subject to variance, but since you have a large number of attacks every fight your actual crit rate will converge to your expected crit rate.<br>
<br>
The difference to expertise is that you will get the same (expected) damage if you crit every other hit over ten seconds as you would get if you crit every hit for 5 seconds and then don't crit at all for 5 seconds. This is <b>not</b> the case with expertise. Let's assume you attack for one minute and your lack of expertise has your opponent dodge two special attacks. If the first dodge occurs after 15 seconds and the second dodge occurs after 45 seconds, there will be almost loss of damage, since you have a free cd every 30 seconds anyway and the rune grace period often keeps you from desyncing your rune set. Now, in the other scenario your first strike gets dodged and you try to recast it right afterwards and it gets dodged again. The damage loss in this case is tremendous, since you don't have two free gcds in this short period of time, so you are quite likely to overcap RP in the following few seconds making you effectively lose maybe half a DC. Also, if it was a PS or BS your rune pair will be desynced, messing up your rotation, incurring an additional damage loss later on when you try to readjust it.<br>
So, as opposed to most other stats, for expertise it's not only important if the negative events occur, but also when they occur. So, think you have 5.5% expertise and switch to 4.5%. Your chance to be dodged increases by 1%, which certainly incurs some loss (a dodged white attack is always a loss), but in addition the probability of the "catastrophic" event, i.e. you get dodged on two styles in a row, also increases. This implies diminishing returns to expertise (or high returns if you have low expertise), but it also shows that even at high levels the value of expertise depends a lot on how much weight you give reliability.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1557066"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Im a long time reader of this thread i find i seldom post because most questions or ideas i have are usually already brought up and thoroughly analyzed by someone else before i can even mull them over. So i appreciate greatly all the work thats been done here. <br>
<br>
What ive noticed lately in icc10 and 25 within the last two weeks seems to be a fairly substantial loss in dps on most bosses. Ive looked through these forums as well as blizzard official ones and a few logs from dks all over to see if i could find any trends. I do not run logs typically for my guilds runs but i will start this week in order to dispel the "onyxia breaths more" feeling behind what might be going on. <br>
<br>
But to clarify i seem to be doing upwards of 700-1200 less DPS than i would typically do in a raid setting. I dont use a bryntrol so those nerfs didnt affect me. My rotation has remained the same. I run with the same groups in 10/25m every week. I cannot seem to pinpoint where a loss of that magnitude might be coming from. I was wondering if anyone else was experiencing anything similar. I apologize for not having any concrete numbers or logs for analysis currently my server has literally been unplayable this week. This upcoming week i should be able to provide some information. Just wanted to test the waters in case this is all just in my head.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1557220"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Modeling expertise isn't really necessary now that we have two nice sims (Kahorie, simcraft).  It simply becomes a factor in dps variance which, at least simcraft, shows nicely.  It isn't like expertise is the only rng-based stat that affects damage, of course; the difference between a crit SS and non-crit SS is quite a bit, too.  It all amortizes over a fight.<br>
<br>
The problem with any talk of rotations is that your rotation is always going to get screwed up and weird in most any fight.  Even Saurfang, where you may not have a blood rune available and instead need to Rune Tap -- there you go, runes out of sync.  Not to mention the movement or target switching fights that fill ICC.  Rotations are a myth; they exist in the abstract as nice ways to learn but in the real world, it's priority all the way.<br>
<br>
And that's the kicker -- priority makes expertise less valuable.  You would never SS without diseases up, but a rotation may have you do just that if you get back-to-back dodges.  In the real world, you'd move on to refreshing diseases etc instead.  It definitely is true that lost GCDs can hurt when it comes to extra sources of RP (which ICC is replete with -- many fights where AMS is great as well as revitalize, of course) but ultimately you are trading other stats which make up for it.  It's all well and good to say "wow you missed half a DC, that's 2k damage amortized over the whole fight" but the 50 armpen or str you picked up in exchange is also working for you throughout the fight as well.  This is simulation territory; intuition and back-of-the-envelope only work so well.  Currently the stat weights are based on a rotation system rather than priority and so they are valued pretty highly compared to priority-based simulation (which is the simcraft default).<br>
<br>
There also is room for personal preference; it really does suck to have to repeat attacks and you definitely feel it during fights.  It definitely is good to have <b>some</b> expertise but perfectly hitting cap isn't necessary.  Lost GCDs do get made up for here and there so really they are just pushed back than lost forever, but if your expertise (or hit) is so low that you do permanently lose GCDs then it is a bigger issue.<br>
<br>
Point for point, expertise and hit give you the same reduction in chance for an attack to fail, but hit affects more abilities and so it is more valuable.  32.79 hit rating is one percent of hit; 8.2 expertise rating gives 1 expertise, so 32.8 expertise rating is needed for 4 expertise which is 1% less attack failure (from behind only, of course).  A big part of this, too, is a failed DC (which only uses hit) costs more than a failed strike (which you can retry since you get the runes refunded immediately).  Miss that DC and 40RP is gone forever.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I run with around 20 expertise in raids atm, and I've yet to have that "catastrophic" problem that was mentioned earlier. Not saying its not possible, but I wouldn't waste a food buff on it. If you had the hit enchant on your gloves I'd say switching to expertise would be good but from str--&gt; Exp it might be a small loss if at all. I'm not a theorycrafting machine so take it for what it's worth. Although I suspect the loss would be minimal at best if there even was one.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>My post was only to illustrate that expertise becomes more valuable the less you have of it. At no point did I try to imply that everyone should start gemming it right now. It's just the point, that it's probably not bad to have at least somewhere around 15 expertise, so that your rotation doesn't get reliably screwed up. Of course is strength and armor penetration at high levels significantly better, but people should never forget the trade-off between consistent damage and a bit more, but volatile damage.<br>
Also the comparison with crit you made is slightly incorrect. If crit would work for Unholy DKs like expertise it would mean that if you have one non-crit you would still get the same damage as if you had a crit, but if you had two non-crits in a row, you'd die (exaggerating a bit, here). For crit it doesn't matter if you crit 20 SS in the first two minutes and then none or if you crit 20 SS over the course of four minutes (except possibly for procs and such that might or might not be up).<br>
Also, it doesn't matter if you have a rotation or priority system. A rotation that is so strict it makes you SS if you have no diseases up is not a rotation, it is idiocy. And in a priority system it sucks as much as in a rotation if your rune pairs are desynced.<br>
<br>
As I've written, expertise is certainly not the best stat an Unholy DK can get (and only gets worse by comparison if you have more than one target) and even at 0 expertise it's probably (certainly) better to eat strength food and enchant AP / Hit / Strength on gloves than expertise, but people should still aim in their gearing for at least some expertise, simply due to the way our resource system works.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Im just browsing WMO &amp; WoL just to see what other DKs are doing in terms of dps, seeing if there is any tricks I can pick up (Use of CDs, BT, AMS etc..), or in fact see if they are reciving Tricks of the Trade.  I keep on stumbling over Blood DKs doing more or just about the same dps as Unholy DKs.  I thought Unholy was better dps than Blood indefinately?  If not when does Unholy start becoming more dps than Blood (iLvl 277?).  I am fully aware that some fights to taper towards Blood than Unholy (My question is regarding Festergut WMO Top 20 for DKs).<br>

Im just browsing WMO &amp; WoL just to see what other DKs are doing in terms of dps, seeing if there is any tricks I can pick up (Use of CDs, BT, AMS etc..), or in fact see if they are reciving Tricks of the Trade.  I keep on stumbling over Blood DKs doing more or just about the same dps as Unholy DKs.  I thought Unholy was better dps than Blood indefinately?  If not when does Unholy start becoming more dps than Blood (iLvl 277?).  I am fully aware that some fights to taper towards Blood than Unholy (My question is regarding Festergut WMO Top 20 for DKs).<br>

More interesting yet is that every competitive DK on that list seems to be gemming for ArP. It may be just a show that ArP is the way to go for gemming as Blood.<br>

</div>Engineering is nice, but BS is still better overall since haste while nice to have, isn't as strong as strength.  The OP says it is third place and sometimes Engineering can be better (for example it was a very short fight where you could get another glove usage right at the end).<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">On the following table, the TOP 20 DPS of all active melee DPS specs on WoL are shown for Festergut 25 man (No Subtlety rogues at all):<br>

Rets are at a good place.<br>
Arms warriors, enhancement shamans and blood DKs are about 6% too low.<br>
Fury warriors are pretty high (endless rage situation with ICC gear)<br>
Frost DKs are by far the worst in terms of melee DPS output.</div>

	</tbody></table>
</div>I'm not sure this is a fair way to compare classes and specs.  Some players may choose their spec based on it being their favorite playstyle or because they think they can get the most DPS out of it, others will do it to make sure the raid has all the necessary buffs.  It's fair to compare say Balance and Feral or Elemental and Enhancement because the gear and playstyle are so different, but for a class with multiple melee DPS specs where one is acknowledged to be better, either because of the buffs it brings, or because it has been shown to do the best damage, more of the best geared DKs will be playing that spec.  It's possible that the top-rated frost DPS DKs are the 2nd best geared DKS DK in a guild, and end up speccing frost to provide the raid with imp. icy talons.  Similarly, arms may only be slightly behind fury, but it's enough of a difference that almost every DPS warrior goes fury if given the chance, but sometimes the less well geared ones are asked to spec arms to provide the MS debuff and trauma for the ferals.<br>
<br>
In any case, it does look like warriors and druids are doing very well, paladins are about right, DKs are a bit low (and frost needs serious work) and shamans are in horrible shape.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>It wasn't my intention to compare the classes/specs and say that all warriors should spec Fury or all DKs should spec Unholy because the specs put out the highest DPS. I just thought it would be interresting to look at how the melee specs perform on tank and spank fights given the current level of gear, since I haven't found any similar post elsewhere.<br>
<br>
For example, in our raids, we had an arms warrior for the 4% damage buff and 2x mutilate rogues for most of the fights. At some point the warrior switched to Fury and one of the rogues went combat to provide the 4% buff himself since it would most probably yield in a higher raid DPS. A chart like this one can help maximize the raid DPS if your players are willing to play another spec (and that they play the other spec as good as their main one).<br>
<br>
As for Unholy DKs, even if we are a bit lower than some specs on pure single target tank and spank fights, and as it was stated by another poster: we still do decent single target damage and our great survivability (that cannot be measured by numbers in a chart similar to this one) allows us to have higher dps uptime on some fights (Sindragosa for example).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I actually prefer the PS, IT. BS, SS, BT&gt; SS(cancel blood tap), Garg ERW, SS SS DC BS BS DC DC. If you're using GoD the 3rd BS should be a pestilence.<br>
<br>
Basically this allows for SS to move up in your rotation, and fitting in an extra BS into your initial rotation. If you're lusting early you'll be using an ironshield potion for your first gargoyle more then likely, and if the fight lasts long enough you'll speed pot the 2nd.(if not I would just aim for speed potting with Fallen Crusader and another proc being up)<br>
<br>
To answer the rest of the question AoD should be used pre-pull still, and ERW best during blood lust or beginning when all your internal/procs are up.<br>

</div>Ok, but you have to realize that there's a selection bias in your data.  You're comparing apples to oranges.<br>
<br>
Let's say there's a raid group with 2 DPS warriors: Albert and Bethie.  Albert does 10k DPS as fury, Bethie does 9.5k DPS as fury, assuming all standard buffs/debuffs are present.  Because your raid leader wants the 4% damage debuff, she asks Bethie to spec arms.  It makes the most sense to do this because you know Arms does less damage than Fury, so you as the warrior doing less damage to provide the buffs.  As Arms, Bethie does 9.4k DPS, only losing 100 DPS over her fury spec.  However, since she's now the top arms warrior in damage, she shows up in your chart as 9.4k DPS whereas Albert shows up at 10k DPS.  It looks like arms is 600 DPS worse than fury, but in reality it's that the best / best geared warriors are speccing fury for the DPS, and the second best / second best geared warriors are speccing arms for the buffs / debuffs.<br>
<br>
Getting rid of this selection bias would be really hard.  I'm not saying your data is useless, just that it should be taken with a grain of salt.  What you're saying isn't that a typical DK specced into frost will do 80% of a typical combat rogue, but rather that the best DKs who end up raiding as frost, whether from personal preference or because they had to spec frost to provide a necessary buff, end up doing 80% of the damage of the best combat rogues.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Considering the sheer number of logs, selection bias isn't actually an issue. It would be, if we were comparing averages, but since he is only looking at the top parses of each distribution, it's very likely (pretty much certain) that these are exclusively well geared players who know what they are doing. I doubt there will be a significant difference in average gear level or skill of the top 20 players in each spec / class.<br>
That's not saying that there is a point to such a comparison (which I doubt), just that selection bias really isn't the issue.<br>
<br>
Your second point about the interpretation of the data is still true, though. It doesn't mean that the average combat rogue is 2k DPS ahead of the average Unholy DK (since we are not compating averages), just that the possible DPS of a combat rogue is 2k DPS ahead.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1565796"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I think the Gargoyle section should be updated.  There was a post awhile back talking about how gargoyles would randomly melee when spawned on top of bosses/mobs.  The remedy to this is to spin 180 degrees when your GCD timer resets and summon the gargoyle.  Although it does not always prevent melees I've found it to be pretty successful.  I have gone from 14% gargoyle melee damage on Saurfang to 4.7% and from 18% on Festergut to 2.5%.  The reason this works is because the gargoyle is spawned away from the boss when you do a 180, thus preventing the melees.  I have to watch more carefully to see what the gargoyle is doing on Festergut to still get melees and will update accordingly.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I think the Gargoyle section should be updated.  There was a post awhile back talking about how gargoyles would randomly melee when spawned on top of bosses/mobs.  The remedy to this is to spin 180 degrees when your GCD timer resets and summon the gargoyle.  Although it does not always prevent melees I've found it to be pretty successful.  I have gone from 14% gargoyle melee damage on Saurfang to 4.7% and from 18% on Festergut to 2.5%.  The reason this works is because the gargoyle is spawned away from the boss when you do a 180, thus preventing the melees.  I have to watch more carefully to see what the gargoyle is doing on Festergut to still get melees and will update accordingly.<br>

</div>I brought this topic back up a couple of pages ago as well and have seen a substantial decrease in the melee strikes from my gargoyle. I believe the comments here about the hit box size are also 100% valid but we're all onto something. I can now perform a full 180 turn/pop racial/pop gargoyle/turn 180 is such a fluid motion that I have what I feel to be no DPS loss. <br>
<br>
What I need to do now is figure out how to get WoL to display the reports of only my gargoyle, and not both from the raid since we run with 2 DK's. Any suggestions there? After reviewing the logs posted above I see there was only the 1 DK so that makes the reporting a little easier. My logs show both gargoyles from both of our DK's and not who's they belong to.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I've been trying the spinning Garg summon and found it pretty succesfull, this would actually make a swing-timer for Death Knights usefull as you don't wanna miss out on a ~5k melee swing.<br>

Like Amroo said, hitbox has alot to do with it for ex on Sindragosa you can and should go max melee range making your Gargoyle always spawn correctly.<br>

</div>No, you just stand very tight together that everyone including tanks gets the shadow protection debuff. Moving to max melee range doesn't make you a valid target vor Vile Gas.<br>

</div>It's not even that much of an issue, since if you had a swing during the time you face away from the boss you will instantly swing as soon as you face him again. So even if you don't track your white hits at all your expected loss is just about a quarter of a white hit (assuming 3 second swing timer and not facing the boss for 1.5 seconds). It would probably be more of a loss if you wait for the swing before you turn and delay runes that way. As soon as one gets really good at twisting such that the non-facing time is less than a second, there is virtually no loss at all.<br>
<br>
About bosses like Sindragosa or Marrowgar it's very important to note that you really must stand at maximum hit box when twisting. If you don't, even if your summoned gargoyle looks like it's very far away from the boss it might still be within melee range (and start meleeing) due to the way the hit box on these bosses exceeds the physical model by a lot.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Consider your Plague Strike averaging for 3,500 non-crit and your Death Coil averaging for 4,500 non-crit.  You use 1 Plague Strike in a 20 second rotation, and you use Death Coil 3-4 times in a rotation.  Without even having to do math you should already see that Death Coil is going to give you more benefit with Dark Death than Plague Strike with its respective glyph, but for math's sake:<br>
<br>
3,500 Plague Strike + Glyph = 4,200<br>
<br>
4,500 Death Coil + Glyph = 5,175<br>
<br>
You are gaining 700 damage per rotation with the Plague Strike glyph and you are gaining 2,025-2,700 damage with the Dark Death glyph.  I'm also taking into account that there is 0/3 Morbidity and it is also ignoring Unholy Blight, so you would be gaining even more damage if you happened to be specialized into them (Blight a given).<br>

Usually diseases are only off for a split second and get refreshed asap never using blood strike with no disease up.  Is there any math or theorycrafting to say its a dps increase (or decrease) to let diseases fall for a split second in order to get an extra SS, or is it better to keep 100% uptime and refresh before they fall off?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Scourge Strike: Now deals 70% weapon damage, plus 12% of physical damage done as shadow damage for each of the death knight's diseases on the target. The net result should be larger strikes with no diseases present, while maximum damage with all diseases applied to the target should stay the same.<br>

Is this going to affect the time to swap to two piece t10? I think the buff to base damage straight would work a little better at the lower gear lvls. (Like myself)<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1566460"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->You all are completely ignoring the fact that the magical disease based damage <i>is completely dependent on the physical damage.</i> Thus even though the disease modifier was cut in half, the damage of the magical strike was not reduced by the same propotion because the physical damage increased.<br>
<br>
To explain:<br>
<br>
Let's say, currently, the physical portion of your SS hits for 6600, while the shadow portion hits for 6750. Those are numbers drawn from a random log, and they're pretty typical. That average SS hit for 13,350.<br>

If the physical damage is increased by 40% (50% -&gt; 70% base), then it will hit for 9240. Now, if the shadow portion was hitting for 103% (6750/6600) of the physical potion, but is reduced by 48% (25%/disease to 12%/disease), then ti will be hitting for 49% (1.03 x .48) of the physical strike, for a magical damage of 4528 (9240 x .48). That average SS hit is then 13,767. <br>

</div>While what you say is true, he is right there will be a small shift in ArP being worth more since the physical portion of SS was buffed.<br>
<br>
Old SS was 50% weapon Damage as physical<br>
New SS is 70% of weapon Damage as physical<br>
<br>
This will equate to a buff to ArP stat weight since even more of our damage is counted as physical and even less as shadow.<br>
<br>
I think the patch notes forget to mention the bonus damage as well, but I think this is because they are not changing that part of SS tool tip, maybe it will stay at 400. If they were removing it or increasing it I think they would have posted that information.<br>
<br>
Sounds like this is the mid-season PvP buff we've been expecting since DKs run into disease cleansing problems in arenas.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>It wouldn't look at it this way, but more that less partial resists offset the damage loss from the smaller amount of static damage. To illustrate:<br>
<br>
Now (about):<br>
<br>
5000 phsyical + 5000 shadow. Shadow damage gets 5% partial resist to 4750, for 9750 total.<br>
<br>
If they change SS that it does the same damage without partial resists, it will be:<br>
<br>
7000 physical + 3000 shadow. Shadow damage gets 5% partial resist to 2850, for 9850 total. We get a 100 damage increase per SS. That increases the value of ArP, because a larger percentage of our damage will be affected by ArP, since SS increases, while all other sources of damage stay constant.<br>
<br>
But partial resist could also be taken to make the pre-partial numbers a little lower:<br>
<br>
6930 physical + 2970 shadow. Shadow damage gets 5% partial resist to 2822, for 9752 total - as pre patch. Value of ArP stays the same, since our damage composition remains unchanged.<br>
<br>
The point is, the value of ArP is not determined by considering if SS does 1000 or 10000000 damage, but by the percentage of our total damage that is affected by ArP. If SS damage increases, more of our damage is from a style that is affected by ArP, making ArP better compared to other stats.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Nice video.<br>
<br>
Just a question about the blood tap thing though. Maybe I'm wrong, its quite late I'm not thinking all to clear.<br>
But don't you still only gain 1 BS, and not 1 SS like you claimed in the video.<br>
<br>
Basically a normal rotation goes like this:<br>
BS-BS - 10 seconds later - SS<br>
<br>
Your rotation does this:<br>
BS - SS - 10 seconds later - BS - BS <br>
<br>
Since the SS in the first rotation uses up the deathrunes (or rather one of them since blood tap remains up, but i assume you use a cancelaura to set that straight).<br>
The net gain is 1 BS, no different than as if you would have just burned BT on a BS.<br>
As far as I can tell all you do is "swap around" the BS-BS and Deathrune-SS, which should only be a gain if the boss happens to die between those two. <br>
That doesn't take away this is probably the cleanest way to use Blood Tap though, little chance of messing things up. <br>
<br>
<br>
As for the disease juggling, I think you even sold it short there. Because you actually gain nearly 2 diseases ticks per 20 seconds extra.<br>
Normally you have nearly 6 second without any disease ticks because you refresh BP and FF just before they are about to do their final ticks. Meaning you lose 2 disease ticks.<br>
With disease juggling, not only do you let one of the diseases run its course (1 tick gain), you also refresh the other one right after a tick, meaning you have practically no extended downtime before the next tick (another tick gain).<br>
<br>
I agree that this could be added to the OP, it's an "advanced" technique though.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Let's just look at the last rune pair. Assume you use BT for an extra BS:<br>
<br>
BS-BS-BS<br>
SS<br>
BS-BS<br>
SS<br>
BS-BS<br>
SS<br>
BS-BS (BT cooldown up)<br>
SS-BS<br>
BS-BS<br>
SS<br>
BS-BS<br>
SS<br>
BS-BS<br>
SS (2:20 minutes passed, 16 BS, 7 SS)<br>
<br>
Video-way:<br>
<br>
BS-SS<br>
BS-BS<br>
SS<br>
BS-BS<br>
SS<br>
BS-BS<br>
SS (BT cooldown up)<br>
BS-SS<br>
BS-BS<br>
SS<br>
BS-BS<br>
SS<br>
BS-BS<br>
SS (2:20 minutes passed, 14 BS, 8 SS)<br>
<br>
After this it repeats. What you do is, you move with each BT your death rune pair half a rotation up. After two rounds you will have moved it an entire rotation up. Of course you will lose a blood rune pair and two BS. But this cancels out since you do an extra BS before every BT-SS.<br>
The cleanliness of this method you mentioned is important in addition to that. It's impossible to desync runes.<br>
<br>
The point about juggling might be valid, my brain is a bit sleepy right now and thinking hurts. It only reinforces the point, anyways.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>No, he doesn't mean it like you and he's right. The shadow damage portion of SS is affected by ArP because it's based on the physical damage done which is affected by ArP. Thus unless the total damage done by SS (physical+shadow) increases, you will not see an increase of DPS gained from ArP.<br>
<br>
It's just what it's supposed to be: More damage if you don't have all diseases up and nearly the same damage when you have all diseases up.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1566814"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->A reminder on partial resists:<br>
<br>
Targets above the caster's level have an innate, unavoidable 8 magic resist per level, so bosses have 24 magic resist for all players.<br>
<br>
The formula to calculate average resistance is:<br>
Average Resistance = (Target's Resistance / (Caster's Level * 5)) * 0.75<br>
<br>
Thus, bosses have a (24/(80*5)) * 0.75 = 0.045% average resistance to spell damage.<br>
<br>
Using Consider's numbers of 6600 average physical and 6750 average shadow, this means 6750/(6750+6600), or 50.56%, of our Scourge Strike damage is subject to an innate 0.045% damage reduction from partial resists (over a sufficiently long period of time to eliminate outliers from randomness). In other words, partial resists currently reduce Scourge Strike damage by 0.023%.<br>
<br>
Since the physical portion should now average out at 9240 and the shadow portion at 4528, for an average hit of 13,767, the portion of shadow damage is then 4528/13,767 = 32.89%, which is subject to the innate 0.045% damage reduction from partial resists. Then with this change, partial resists will reduce Scourge Strike damage by 0.015%.<br>
<br>
Thus, the change in stat weights as a result of the difference in partial resist effects is on the order of 0.008%.<br>
<br>
In short, the fact that Scourge Strike's base physical strike is now a higher portion of the overall Scourge Strike damage is massively dwarfed by the fact that Blizzard appears to have rounded overall Scourge Strike damage in our favor. The ArP stat weight will be affected far more by the fact that Scourge Strike, on the whole, hits 2-3% harder than by the fact it's "more physical" (which is an abuse of terminology in the first place).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Good that you mentioned it, I forgot to take 2T10 into account which most people probably wear by now. Also, the static portion profits really weirdly from Outbreak and 2T10 and I have no clue why that is. However, the math becomes:<br>
<br>
Scourge Strike was:<br>
<br>
(0.65*D + 676)(1 + 0.75 * 1.43)<br>
<br>
where 1.43 is as far as I know the double-dip multiplier for the shadow portion<br>
<br>
New Scourge Strike:<br>
<br>
(0.91*D + 946) * (1 + 0.36 * 1.43)<br>
<br>
Then<br>
<br>
1.347*D + 1401 &lt; 1.378*D + 1433<br>
<br>
So with these data it's a clear PVE buff of about 2.3% Scourge Strike damage. However, this doesn't take partial resists into account. If we do that with the average partial at 4.5% as mentioned earlier we get<br>
<br>
Scourge Strike was:<br>
<br>
(0.65*D + 676)(1 + 0.75 * 1.43 * 0.955)<br>
<br>
New Scourge Strike:<br>
<br>
(0.91*D + 946) * (1 + 0.36 * 1.43 * 0.955)<br>
<br>
Then<br>
<br>
1.316 * D + 1368 &lt; 1.357 * D + 1411<br>
<br>
So taking partial resists into account PVE SS damage increases by around 3.1%. If we take SS to be about 23% of our single target damage, it's a slight boost of a about 0.7%. Rejoice!<br>

</div>Correct, it doesn't matter how large the physical portion is. However, the total SS damage will slightly increase as shown, making ArP slightly more desrieable than other stats. Refer <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100226173605/http://elitistjerks.com/f72/t72364-unholy_dps_3_3_3_dont_leave_me/p108/#post1567121" target="_blank">to this post</a> for details.<br>
<br>
Scaling of SS will also be 3% better than it is now, since the coefficient for weapon damage is larger. Bonus damage really is just the icing.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Since this seems to be the classical "if SS was 6n physical dmg + 6n magic damage, we will make it become 9n physical damage + 3n magic damage and call it a day" change, won't the scaling with Ebon Plague be reduced somehow?<br>
<br>
In pve, the magical damage portion benefitted from quite a few "double dipping" effects on buffs with magical effects; since the amount of Shadow damage done will be less now, there will be less magic damage to scale with those buffs.<br>
<br>
It sprung to my mind thinking of fights like Valkyrs (I would assume SS damage to drop dramatically on that fight now) but it would apply in a smaller scale to more or less everything else, no?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Your ability goes on CD but it shows your rune as being up?  And if it's the blood rune it won't turn into a death rune so you can't do your SS x3? <br>
<br>
There's was a bug report on that way back; as you can see it's not a UI issue.  Apparently it's been around for awhile now, but I've only recently got it when 3.3 hit.  Blizzard hasn't said anything regarding that, and it's definitely not something that seems easily replicable.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">A couple quick observations.<br>
<br>
Since this seems to be the classical "if SS was 6n physical dmg + 6n magic damage, we will make it become 9n physical damage + 3n magic damage and call it a day" change, won't the scaling with Ebon Plague be reduced somehow?<br>
<br>
In pve, the magical damage portion benefitted from quite a few "double dipping" effects on buffs with magical effects; since the amount of Shadow damage done will be less now, there will be less magic damage to scale with those buffs.<br>
<br>
It sprung to my mind thinking of fights like Valkyrs (I would assume SS damage to drop dramatically on that fight now) but it would apply in a smaller scale to more or less everything else, no?</div>
			
		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>Anything that causes SS to double dip is included in the 1.43 multiplier in my calculations. That is, with the exception on Twin Valkyr (where it will be a nerf, but who cares), it will be slight buff.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

The current reaping build with the following rotation is standard.<br>
<br>
PS – IT – BS – BS – SS – DC – HoW<br>
SS – DC – SS – SS – DC – (DC) <br>
<br>
Would replacing GoDD with GoD and using the following rotation be a DPS increase with the new changes to SS?<br>
<br>
Start:<br>
PS – IT – BS – Pest – SS – DC<br>
Repeat:<br>
SS – DC – SS – SS – DC – (DC) <br>
Pest – BS – SS – SS – DC<br>
<br>
Since with T10 vs. T9 we no longer need the BS to proc the set bonus only create the Death Runes which Pest also does.  Also back before 3.3 was using frost DW and Awareness was best because of the huge boost it gave to Obliterate.  Now with the increases to SS would having a static boost from Awareness be better possibly for a rotation using that many SS?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yes.<br>
<br>
<br>
Before more people ask about an increasing value of ArP with the changes, I will show some math to quickly approximate the change in weights. The resulting formula depends on your current stat weight for ArP, your percentage of total damage done that benefits from ArP (p0 for pre patch, p1 for post patch) and your percentage of total damage done by SS (s).<br>
<br>
Right now you do p0 damage that is affected by ArP and s damage done by SS. SS damage will increase by approximately 3.1%, so after patch you will do (p0 + s * 0.031) damage that is affected by ArP. To get your p1 you need to divide it by (1 + s * 0.031). Then you divide p1 by p0 and multiply the result with your current stat weight.<br>
<br>
As an example I take myself:<br>
About 56% of my damage are affected by ArP (Melee + SS + BS + Necrosis + BcB + PS), so p0 = 0.56<br>
SS constitutes 23% of my total damage, so s = 0.23<br>
<br>
p1 is then: p1 = (0.56 + 0.23*0.031) / (1 + 0.23 * 0.031) = 0.56311<br>
<br>
p1/p0 = 1.0056<br>
<br>
So the value of ArP increases by 0.56%! Right now ArP weighs around 2.45 for me, so after patch it will be a whopping 2.46! <b>The change in weights is miniscule and will not affect anything</b> and people can stop asking about it.<br>
The total DPS increase of the change is (1 + 0.23 * 0.031) - 1 = 0.7%<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Would probably be the rotation i used. Makes the rotation much more fluid.<br>
<br>
One problem i find with using GoD is blood tap isn't nearly as useful. If you're not using GoD, it's much easier to push SS up in your rotation.<br>
<br>
If I knew I could get tricks every fight in the beggining and cinderglacier was even reasonably reliable GoD would be sooo much better : (.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>No, doubling the damage for the physical part would double the damage of the shadow part, therefore the entire attack is doubled.

</div>Yeah, but the only speculation was that the guy was moving, and that discussion quickly turned into a DRW bug discussion instead.  Might not be related to 4 pc t10, but that's the only thing that I'm aware of having changed in the game over the last week for me and the two lined up perfectly in terms of when the bug started happening.  Not sure if the first reporter (Hellion) had 4 pc t10 or not.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I was definitely not moving, jumping, /stopcasting, or being targeted by any enemies during any of the times that I summoned the AotD and got the bug.  Taking AoE damage perhaps, but since one of the goals of the spell is to mitigate damage while channelling, it would be awfully silly if the damage was interrupting spellcast.  Also, the spell did work about 20% of the time (though very, very small sample size).  Anyway, weird.<br>
<br>

The current reaping build with the following rotation is standard.<br>

Would replacing GoDD with GoD and using the following rotation be a DPS increase with the new changes to SS?<br>

Since with T10 vs. T9 we no longer need the BS to proc the set bonus only create the Death Runes which Pest also does.  Also back before 3.3 was using frost DW and Awareness was best because of the huge boost it gave to Obliterate.  Now with the increases to SS would having a static boost from Awareness be better possibly for a rotation using that many SS?</div>

</div>This is correct, no longer possible. <br>
<br>
To answer the above questions:  I've found that using pestilence to disease the vile spirits works out well, just be ready to get the hell away as well.  I'm pretty sure D&amp;D won't actually hit them while they're floating above.  As for Defile, AMS is good for saving your ass but I'd be hesitant to use it to try to 'dodge' the application.  I don't think PWS works the same way.<br>
<br>
For an additional point of reference, I use GoD with 4pc 258 for use with the ghouls/shamblers, valkyrs, and vile spirits.  This gives a bit of an inflated DPS value, but tends to generally contribute more to the raid than just pretending I'm a glorified single-target DPS.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>1) Typically I use a full AoE rotation P1.  The Plague should be on the shambling horrors not the little ghouls.<br>
<br>
2) Kite Vile spirits.  If you get in melee range they explode and prior to coming down I believe they are too far out of range for Pest to hit them, but I've never tried.  When they finally come down we just kite them (chains work, so does desecrate).  If you need to get rid of one AMS+Grip will take care of it, just make sure no one's around you.<br>
<br>
3) If you start running when defile goes out, you shouldn't need to AMS.  I've never tried to AMS the defile application.<br>
<br>
Instead I've found it good to AMS the infest.  If you pop AMS before he casts Infest 2 things happen:<br>
<br>
a) you don't get the infest debuff<br>
b) you gain about 40-60 RP.<br>
<br>
Its a minor thing but if you're chasing a Valk down, it may help your healers out, and net you some more burst.<br>
<br>
Another tip: both our DK's have speced desecration for LK.  It helps because it drops a slow on the valks as soon as they drop.  I've actually found it fairly useful on the 10 man hard modes as well (Saurfang, Dreamwalker) as an extra measure of snaring.  Your results may vary.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Yeah, but the only speculation was that the guy was moving, and that discussion quickly turned into a DRW bug discussion instead.  Might not be related to 4 pc t10, but that's the only thing that I'm aware of having changed in the game over the last week for me and the two lined up perfectly in terms of when the bug started happening.  Not sure if the first reporter (Hellion) had 4 pc t10 or not.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I was definitely not moving, jumping, /stopcasting, or being targeted by any enemies during any of the times that I summoned the AotD and got the bug.  Taking AoE damage perhaps, but since one of the goals of the spell is to mitigate damage while channelling, it would be awfully silly if the damage was interrupting spellcast.  Also, the spell did work about 20% of the time (though very, very small sample size).  Anyway, weird.<br>
<br>
Until this is fixed, I have to agree that pre-casting AotD is the best DPS option as it avoids this bug.</div>

</div>Not really certain what causes the problem but I can tell you it's likely unrelated to 4pc since I currently only wear 2 piece T10 but had the bug happen the last time I checked (though to be fair, I think the last time I checked may have been in 4pc T9).<br>
<br>
I know that it's not related to being in combat as i've had no problems summoning it after being ticked into combat with Festergut as well as after a phase transition during Putricide. I don't know if it's AoE damage related since i've summoned it successfully during Sindragosa P3. The times i've had it fail more than once was mid combat in melee range with auto attack on during BQL.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1568247"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Speaking to the Army of the Dead summoning cast interrupt, I have also encountered this on several occasions, most noticeably on Putricide and Sindragosa.  <br>
<br>
For Putricide, I have found that summoning Army immediately after coming out of stun between phase 2 and phase 3 transition does not cause the summon to fail, but waiting a bit for the tank to engage the boss does.  If this is indeed true, and happening for others in a very similar manner, then it could be better evidence that it is an AoE boss effect causing this bug.  If its not a fluke that I have been able to successfully cast Army during this transition, then the boss AoE effect is not active right away.<br>
<br>
For Sindragosa, I have had successful Army summoning while hiding behind frost tombs but not while standing in the open.  <br>
<br>
Again, being affected or not affected by boss AoE effects does appear to be affecting the cast of Army of the Dead in my experience.  These are solely antecdotal at the moment, but if someone is working towards detailing this bug, this information might prove helpful.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>To be honest DND is useful in p2 and p3 (I use it when the valks are summoned and on vile spirits - it hits them), but yeah overall the glyph probably is a dps loss, especially if your guild does the strat where you group ghouls around the shambler and use the disease to burn them.<br>
<br>
I'd be less certain about GoD. I'd say it depends on how good you play with it, because there is certainly almost always something in the fight to be pesting diseases to.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Then between a mutilate rogue, paladin tank w imp hoj, resto sham w frost shock in addition to hamstring we found desecration was actually detrimental given the mobs can fly out of it given a poorly placed defile.   We also basically disallowed pet stuns, as our rog was seeing 1ish second 5 point ks, after the initial hoj by our paladin tank.<br>

</div>Overall I imagine it would be a dps loss, but for damage on Val'kyrs it is probably a large improvement.<br>
Each Chains of Ice is a loss of a Scourge Strike, theoretically leaving you with a plague strike, the damage difference between Plague Strike and Scourge Strike is alot larger than what those 2 points would contribute during that phase.<br>
There is also the fact that CoI is a global cooldown without dealing any damage and due to the rather quick diminishing effect on CoI you would probably have to cast it twice/thrice before the Val'kyrs are dead.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1569558"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Just a couple of things that Id like to clarify for people. <br>
<br>
In my opinion, its better for the raid, and obviously our dps, to have a warrior just spec into piercing howl. Our raid also typically has 3-5 paladins and 2-4 rogues so stunning the adds is not an issue. The sooner you can use your stuns the more you can get some incidental aoe damage on all 3 of them. Assuming you execute properly in stacking up. <br>
<br>
Also, if you cast pesti while LK is casting his Vile Spirits cast, you can get some aoe damage up on them. Id link our WoL but we dont have them up yet from our LK kill. Also, using chains on the spirits as they come down is very helpful for the raid if you see one chasing someone / a group at ranged. Kind of kills dps tho :/<br>
<br>
As mentioned as well, you can taunt the spirits, so if you have ams/ibf and you can grip tuant/grip one to soak some damage its well worth it. Just be careful not to die. Best to just have the raid spread out in this phase.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1569582"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I think my point was missed.  Obviously, everything in under some circumstances has a potential use (referring to glyph swapping).  The purpose for these forums should be maximizing efficiency-yes, you can find some gain for GOD/GODD in other phases, but WILL result in 1) enhancing your aoe numbers in P1; and 2) reducing your single target numbers in P2/3.  I would even go so far as dispute the efficiency gain in P1, if you're taking longer to push LK into P2.  I don't think this is even debatable, and I am sure that I'm not inventing an issue out of an inability to efficiently pestilence the valkyr.<br>
<br>
Despite the DMB timers, the Valkyr always swoops in right before the defile is cast.  This means that it's probably a useful opportunity to stun, then back out as a defile is incoming.  If it's on you, or you have to run around the puddle for other reasons, there is no reason not to COI on the move.  Even if it isn't, the movement reduction from desecration is vastly inferior to COI:  While you may sacrifice personal dps on the valkyr, you give everyone else in the raid more time to kill it.  With that said, I fail to see the logic in sacrificing talent points to pursue a less effective raid strategy.<br>
<br>
I was unaware that DND hits the ghosts, thanks for that clarification. Adding to P3 mechanics, you can also pestilence/BB your diseases to/upon them.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Chains is a GCD.  Unless you blow your death runes you're only getting 2 chains out at 2 GCDs and zero damage.  Desecration applies a snare to the whole area without sacrificing any damage.  Also useful for Heroic, and I suppose normal, Saurfang/Valithria.  It's a shame that the Unholy tree is so ridiculously bloated (I'm looking at you Desolation) that you need to drop dps points to get it, but honestly the sacrifice of roughly 1 maybe 2% of personal DPS for the utility is pretty minor.<br>
<br>
EDIT: Also I wanted to reiterate the point that wasting pages upon pages of GoD vs. GoDD discussion has been proven time and time again to be futile.  It always comes down to a roughly 1-2% difference in overall DPS and a playstyle change (in terms of single target DPS).  There has never been data one way or another to definitively say that GoD is or isn't a huge difference.  Everybody should really just let this one rest.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I do not think this is correct. Defile has been before the val'kyr; atleast from what I remember from our attempts. And yes there is no reason not to chains of ice while on the move that is if you are running from defile. <br>

Why is chains of ice so superior to desecration?<br>
In theory you're losing a GCD and a rune for a slow that potentially for 3-4 seconds before being overridden by any other slow. It is possible that since the val'kyrs can only be slowed to a maximum of 50%, then its possible that chains only slows them to 50% and they gain 10% per second.<br>
<br>
<br>
Another issue with chains of ice on lich king is that it seems to override every other slow, but in return only slows at 50% for possbily 1 second, where as desecration slows a static 50% for 20 seconds in a 7 yard radius, or a 14pi circumference. <br>
<br>
If you're like most videos I've watched, you group up in the middle for Val'kyrs and then spread out, then if you are scourge striking Lich King, or even a plague strike you already have a static 50% snare on the val'kyrs without even having to switch and lose GCDs/Damage on Val'kyrs. Also, if the vile spirits get low enough they are also slowed by desecration.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I do not think this is correct. Defile has been before the val'kyr; atleast from what I remember from our attempts. And yes there is no reason not to chains of ice while on the move that is if you are running from defile. <br>

</div>    Chains of ice (tooltip): "Shackles the target with frozen chains, reducing their movement by 95%.  The target regains 10% of their movement each second for 10 sec."<br>
<br>
     I take your point that it is possible for COI to work differently in a boss encounter-in fact I agree that it pertains to this fight.  I can, however, tell you with certainty that COI slows the valkyr MUCH more than 50%-probably the full 95%.  Despite the original speed reduction, however, the valkyr definitely regained movement speed much faster than indicated by the tooltip.  So we can consider two scenarios:  One where you are applying full DPS to the valkyr but it's only slowed 50%; and another where you're just spamming COI and working in PS and DC when the rune is on CD.  Unholy is not a bursty spec, and compared to a ret paladin, hunter, and arcane mage(referring to my raid comp), our damage is almost inconsequential.<br>
<br>
     On the point about the defile always coming AFTER the valkyr, let me first stipulate that I'm talking exclusively about the 10m version, and only in situations when they are both going to occur within a small window of time (approx 3-4 sec).  This was a very helpful insight for us, since the timers coincided about 2/3 of the time:  We would group up when the timers ticked to about 3sec., wait for valkyr to pop, and then stun/run out for the defile so that it's not dropped in the middle, then chains spam while weaving in DCs and PSs.  It is also useful to have your AMS up for this:  Whenever the defile was on me, I would keep going straight, pop unholy pres. and circle around-sometimes ranging me from the healers if there was another puddle in the way.  The AMS can preemptively absolve the infest, should it be cast while I was on the move.  <br>
<br>
    I'd like to see some more feedback on this mechanic, because it nearly trivialized the second phase for us and I'd like to see some others benefit from it as well.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Yes, because chains of ice only lasts so long and you'll eventually be on rune cooldown unable to continiously cast it on the mobs, not to mention you wouldn't be dpsing very well at that point either really just casting chains which again, detracts from your overall dps.  The mobs are slowed to a max of 50 so having a cons. down is a lot more forgiving for dpsing/moving/getting out of the defile if its called.<br>
<br>
Also, pop ams when the ghosts are coming down (not sure if it was suggested or not) as you can soak all the exploding damage from them.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I'm sure that's the design philosophy, but it's sort of a cop-out reasoning when the Valks are generally dead by the time you run out of stuns.  Sure it would trivialize it in 10man, but in 25 you're not ever going to have enough runes to perma-snare 3 Valks, and certainly not while doing some sort of DPS.<br>
<br>
Long story short - due to COI having a stealth nerf on it for that encounter, Desecration is neato to have there if you're willing to drop 1% personal DPS into it.  In terms of general raid benefit, that's a pretty small sacrifice.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Sure, one DK in your 25 man wouldn't be able to keep 3 Valks locked down but what about the guilds that raid with 2-3? That's also not taking into account the DK stacking guilds would inevitably do for that fight, if perma-snaring Valkyr's was possible. Handling the Valks correctly is arguably the hardest part of the encounter, and there is no way around the fact that full effect CoI would be overpowered there.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">People really under-estimate the value of glyph of disease. It's actually the best single target glyph of all 3 if used correctly and assuming you can convince a rogue to ToT you in the beggining.(you can easily gain an extra 75k+ dmg just from that one tot in a 5minute fight, which makes you the 2nd best target behind affliction locks for the first ToT.) <br>
<br>
Not only that but on any fight where you'll pestilence the value of the glyph goes up quiet a bit. Remember the extra wandering plague dmg alone usually makes pestilence better then 1 blood strike assuming desolation will stay up.<br>
<br>
On a fight where you can fish for cinderglacier procs during down-time GoD also gains some value.(Think Sindragosa during the air phase)<br>
<br>
Here's a short-list of fights where I find GoD to be worthwhile even if I don't get the first ToT.<br>
<br>
Marrowgar - makes it easier to keep full disease up during bone storm, also convenient when pestilencing to bone spikes.<br>
<br>
Deathwhisper - Pretty obvious if you're cleaving down the adds, you'll be casting pestilence anyways.<br>
<br>
Saurfang - You can sync it to refresh diseases and get EPB on all the adds with GoD.<br>
<br>
Putricide - You'll quiet often be able to pestilence from ooze to putricide.<br>
<br>
Sindragosa - Try to proc cinderglacier while she is in the air, you can keep 20% diseases rolling till next ground phase.<br>
<br>
Lich King - You'll be constantly pestilencing to Valks, Ghouls, Vile Spirits anyways.<br>
<br>
Blood Princes it can be useful on depending how far you tank the mobs apart. GoD is decent for Blood Queen(since SS is your best scaling ability, still might be worse then GoDD here though.) Rotface you might gain a bit extra wandering plague dmg but nothing worth noting. Festergut is the only fight where there is literally no benefit outside of what the glyph does/sims.<br>
<br>
<br>
I really think people look at sims and under-value GoD. GoD is much more then it sims out to be...<br>
<br>
<br>
<u>About the lich king:</u><br>
<br>
I could be wrong about this but I think Lich King has a priority casting system which is something along the lines of Vile Spirits &gt; Infest &gt; Defile &gt; Soul Reaping. Valkyrs isn't something he casts but he won't cast anything while they are spawning. This is why when everything happens to come off cooldown at once you'll notice Infest &gt; Defile &gt; Soul Reaping all casted one after another. This may not be 100% correct, but from what I've noticed it's pretty consistent.</div>

</div>Ok, on my typical Festergut parses I see Frost Fever at 5.4% of my DPS, Blood Plague at 4.6% and Ebon Plague at 4.8% of my DPS. Lets round that up to 15% combined which would benefit from ToTT and/or Cinderglacer procs.<br>
<br>
Now, in a perfect fight assuming I dropped GoDD and had ToTT at the start and never once let my diseases drop off the boss. The benefit I would see is a 15% increase in those numbers, going from 15% of my DPS to 17.25, a 2.25% DPS increase. To get this I have to give up 15% of my death coil damage (1.5% of my overall damage) and half my blood strikes, 2.7% of my overall damage. Even in the perfect situation with ToTT rolled the entire time GoD works out as a substantial DPS loss (about 2%).<br>
<br>
In theory, if you could roll it with a cinderglacier proc the entire time too it would work out to a marginal DPS gain (around 0.5%) but I don't think that is really a practical option. Fishing for Cinderglacier procs has the problem that you need to avoid using any Frost or Shadow attack while you fish for fear of wasting the proc if you get it. <br>
<br>
I would be very interested to see any Unholy parse on Festergut where 15% more on EP, FF + BP adds up to more than 15% of DC + 50% of BS damage. I will accept that if you could get Cinderclacier and ToTT up and roll both through the entire fight you will find situations where it is a marginal DPS increase but realistically I don't think anyone will be rolling both of those the entire time, it is just too impractical to get a cinderglacier proc at the start. <br>
<br>
I have looked through several of the top unholy parses on that fight and can't find any where GoD + ToTT would add up to a DPS gain. Yes, in any AoE situation or on any boss where you will use pestillence anyway it will work out to a DPS gain but given that there is, basically, one single target fight where you can roll diseases non stop (assuming you dont have to move with the spore thingy) and that I can't find any parse on that fight where it would actually be a DPS gain I think it is fair to say that in practical situations GoD is not going to be a DPS gain on single target.<br>
<br>
I think most people who think it is look at their death coils and diseases and think "wow, 15% more of my diseases would be a lot better than 15% more on my death coils" and forget about the 50% of their Blood Strikes they have to give up to cast pestilence once every 20 seconds.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

You of course, lose the damage from Plague Strike and Icy Touch to get that Scourge Strike, but that is obviously a DPS gain - whether it's enough to make up the difference is obviously the question.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1571431"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I like the Icy-Talons change.   The talent would synergise really well with an unholy build.  Of course the major issue with taking the tree for a dps subspec is still the weakness in the first tier.  If fixing that was a desired goal then the obvious solution would be to have imp. icy touch also buff frost fever damage.<br>
<br>
Black ice has been nerfed a bit in 3.3.3 in relation to other talents with the SS rebalancing.<br>
<br>
GoD is usable on a few single target fights, but the problem is if you can use GoD to refresh your diseases then you should be able to twist diseases which gets you 97.5% of the ticks you'd get with GoD.  So it comes down to having to roll those extra damage buffs and hoping the extra damage will outweigh the damage you lose in the rotation.  In that respect as SS is buffed a bit in 3.3.3, GoD is a bit more competitive, but it's still not there for single target dps.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Fishing for Cinderglacier procs will mean, in almost every situation, swapping in your old weapon with the cinderglacier enchant, thats going to be a DPS loss. You also lose at least two global cooldowns (for the weapon swaps) even if you are lucky and get it on the first swap, and, assuming you have a rogue sitting on his ToTT waiting to cast it on you, whatever cooldowns it takes between you yelling on vent "Hey, ToTT me now" and him casting it since you can't use any PS-IT or SS in that time without burning your Cinderglacier proc. You also have to subtract from the raid the DPS the rogue loses by saving his ToTT until you get the proc.<br>
<br>
Just for curiosity how many times have you managed to roll two Cinderglacierd / ToTTed diseases for an entire fight? Can you link a log where it was successfully managed by anyone? I just suspect that it is a theoretical possibility but a practical nonentity. <br>
<br>
Look through the top 20 unholy DK parses for Festergut on wow meters, every single one has 10-12 casts each of PS-IT. If glyph of disease was such a big DPS increase on single target wouldn't it stand to reason that at least one of the top 20 parses would use it? I don't think its a case of people looking at sims and undervaluing GoD, it's a case of people looking at reality and seeing its actual value. On Saurfang for example you will see plenty top parses with DKs rolling a single ToTT for the entire fight so obviously there are plenty of DKs capable of doing this, but not a single one of the top parses on Festergut, the only real single target fight in the game shows this. If the sims put it as a DPS loss, and the parses put it as a DPS loss then I would say the onus is on the person claiming it is a DPS gain single target to do the proving. <br>
<br>
Again, you are not just giving up a PS + IT + BS for a SS + Pest, you also lose 5 runic power in that exchange, so you are giving up PS + IT + BS + 12.5% of a DC SS + Pest. On any parses I look at that works out to be a slight DPS loss. <br>
<br>
Even on AoE fights for the most part it will be impossible to roll a ToTT boosted diseases for any length of time. Saurfang is probably the exception in ICC (ToC has a couple of fights where its practical), anytime you are switching to adds it is almost certain your original boosted diseases will fall off at some point. either that or you end up having to use pestilence more often than you should to keep the diseases rolling with the associated loss of BSes and DPS loss that would entail.<br>
<br>
Without ToTT and perfect disease rolling never letting your diseases drop on a single target it will end up as a DPS loss whatever way I look at it.<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">GoD is usable on a few single target fights, but the problem is if you can use GoD to refresh your diseases then you should be able to twist diseases which gets you 97.5% of the ticks you'd get with GoD.  So it comes down to having to roll those extra damage buffs and hoping the extra damage will outweigh the damage you lose in the rotation.  In that respect as SS is buffed a bit in 3.3.3, GoD is a bit more competitive, but it's still not there for single target dps.</div>

</div>I can't see disease twisting as a DPS gain either. No matter how you cut it you are turning your 20 second rotation into a 21 second rotation to gain 1 tick on 1 disease. That means giving up 5% of your special ability damage. Since most Unholy DKs will have about 40% of their DPS as special ability damage thats a 2% dps loss. On your diseases you go from 12 ticks per 20 seconds to 13 ticks per 21 seconds. Thats an increase of (13 / 12 * 20 / 21) = ~3.2% in your disease damage. You are losing 2% of your overall damage (by losing 5% of your special ability usage due to rotation stretching) to gain 3.2% in part of your damage. Your diseases would have to be accounting for over 60% of your overall damage for that to work out as a DPS gain, in short, it is a DPS loss.<br>
<br>
Think about it logically, there is literally no way your first cast disease can tick 7 times per rotation unless that rotation is 21 seconds in length. In fact, since your rotation is becoming 21 seconds anyway with disease twisting you would be better served just waiting the extra second and not clipping either disease (though it would still be a DPS loss).<br>
<br>
Take for example the rotation:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">

	<pre class="alt2" dir="ltr" style="

		height: 82px;
		text-align: left;
		overflow: auto">PS-IT-SS...
IT-PS-SS...
PS-IT-SS...
IT-PS-SS...</pre>
</div>It looks nice but the reality is it becomes:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:0px"><img src="/web/20100227054427im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/chestnut/misc/code_html.gif" border="0"></div>
	<pre class="alt2" dir="ltr" style="

		text-align: left;
		overflow: auto">PS-IT-SS...
   IT-PS-SS...
      PS-IT-SS...
         IT-PS-SS...</pre>
</div>You leak a GCD everytime you swap diseases. There is no way around this. I think you are imagining it would work something like:<br>
<br>
<div style="margin:20px; margin-top:5px">
	<div class="smallfont" style="margin-bottom:0px"><img src="/web/20100227054427im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/chestnut/misc/code_html.gif" border="0"></div>
	<pre class="alt2" dir="ltr" style="

		height: 82px;
		text-align: left;
		overflow: auto">PS-IT-SS...
   IT-PS-SS...
PS-IT-SS...
   IT-PS-SS...</pre>
</div>But it can't work, for that to happen your Unholy rune would have to come off cooldown 3 seconds early when you switch back to PS-IT. That is not going to happen.<br>
<br>
You could potentially achieve something similar if you delayed the start of the second rotation by 1 second and abused the two second rule. Then those runes would effectively come off cooldown 9 seconds after you use them. You would basically be alternating between a 21 second rotation and a 19 second rotation abusing the two second rule to make the latter possible. If you do that then you could get both diseases ticking 7 times on the first rotation and 6 on the second but the margin for error would be pretty tight. You still would not disease twist as it is listed here though, anytime you go from PS-IT to IT-PS your first rune will be getting used 3 seconds after it first came off cooldown, you leak a GCD every time and that stretches your rotation by a GCD and will be a hefty DPS loss.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Ah yeah, I could see how it might work in that situation. But it seems incredibly vulnerable to any sort of delay, falling behind by even half a GCD on refreshing your diseases at any point would take one of them out of the two second rule. I would be curious to know how long you can keep that going and whether the situational cost of maintaining it by, for example, not casting a death coil or HoW when you dont have a full GCD before you refresh diseases to avoid unsyncing the runes ends up costing more than the benefit you gain.<br>
<br>
Now that I think of it you could force the same sync by waiting an extra half gcd on the first SS of the 2nd half of your first rotation to sync the FU runes.

</div>I think mostly due to the 2 second rule, it is very very simple to pull off disease twisting. The only delay I've seen is occasionally waiting a fraction of a second for a disease to tick before reapplying, but that only happens with very high haste (glove enchant) and/or bloodlust. In my experience, the hardest thing about it is getting out of the groove of applying one disease first every time.<br>

</div>This is exactly how it works. Rune memory is what makes this happen. In a perfect rotation standing still with no outside RP gen forcing additional GCD's, your first set of UF runes will always cooldown plague then frost no matter how often you disease twist. What happens is you end up with a 21 rune second rotation, then a 19 rune second rotation, then a 21 second rune rotation. Disease twisting works just fine.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		</td>
	</tr>
	</tbody></table>
</div>I think you miss how the trick works.<br>
<br>
You don't refresh your diseases at 21 seconds.<br>
<br>
You refresh your longest remaining disease at 18.1 seconds (2.9 seconds remaining), and then your other disease just ran out as you refresh it.<br>
Ebon Plaguebringer never drops, and Rage of Riverdare only drops once every 40 seconds, and that's assuming there is no other unholy DK in the group.<br>
<br>
There are 2 ways to do it:<br>
1. Use ERW at the start of the fight, this is particulary effective if you pop a gargoyle in your first rotation, which most do. Simply use: <br>
IT&gt;PS&gt;SS&gt;BS&gt;BS &gt;Garg &gt;ERW<br>
SS&gt;DC&gt;SS&gt;SS&gt;DC<br>
PS&gt;IT&gt;SS&gt;BS&gt;BS&gt;etc <br>
(note due to ERW your BS come after your UF runes, thats the reason i put SS before the BS's; the dps loss is neglectable over the course of a fight anyway)<br>
<br>
2. Use another set of runes that refresh at the same time. That means you reapply your diseases in your first rotation.<br>
<br>
-------<br>
<br>
I've done this successfully for entire fights, because once you get used to it it's really simple. ICC has enough fight where you never break combat (Saurfang / Festergut), so you can use the ERW methode. On the fights where you do break you can swap to methode 2.<br>
<br>
The gain is pretty significant too. Because with this methode you eliminate the extended downtime in diseases you normally get. <br>
<br>
Normally you get a tack at 18 seconds. Since you refresh both diseases at 20 seconds, the next tick happens at 23 seconds. That is 5 seconds without disease ticks.<br>
This methode eliminates that 2 seconds of down time on both diseases totally (or reduce it to 0.1-0.3 seconds extra), meaning you get nearly an extra disease tick per rotation for both diseases.<br>
Instead of 6 ticks you get 7 ticks. Thats a 16.67% increase in disease damage (and WP damage ?), Not really sure how much diseases account for but that's an easy 1-2% dps increase for nearly no effort. <br>
Yes you might lose RoR on your blood plague application every 40 seconds, but that loss doesn't compare to the gain.<br>
<br>
Potlol's post still gives a good indication of how the system works;<br>

Is there like a specific rotation that uses ERW + Blood Tap + gargoyle to get like a maximum burst?

Where I've removed some of the no-brainer talents in the unholy tree.<br>
<br>
This isn't ideal obviously as some talents will boost other talents but can give us a rough idea of where to make the trade offs.  With the change Icy Talons is suddenly one of the best optional talents if you can get to it.  Unfortunately the first tier of frost is still incredibly weak, even with the extra RP around boosting the value of RPM.  Incidentally for a non-unholy build the first tier of unholy would also be rather weak.<br>
<br>
In general the optional unholy talents are all rather strong.  Morbidity is the weakest for single target DPS but is obviously one of the best AE talents out there.   Necrosis is usually the next place to steal points  and then the analysis suggests either desolation or impurity.<br>
<br>
ETA:<br>
I missed the new Endless Winter that works out as an even better talent for unholy than icy talons, so the best frost spec would be some form of 0/17/54.  Running with a slightly modified version of the ICC 2H set (as an orc) I'm getting comparably dps to a standard build using just the standard unholy priority.<br>
The disease ticks are hitting about 8% harder, so it's a bit better AE build than the standard one.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1572583"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->After much testing, at current gear levels (which, to be more exact, I simply used my own) I essentially got the following breakdown:<br>
<br>
Sub-Frost + Reapingless &gt; Sub-Blood + Reaping &gt; Sub-Blood + Reapingless &gt; Sub-Frost + Reaping<br>
<br>
Frost Reapingless pulls ahead of Blood Reaping by about 50 dps. It's certainly possible that the latter will pull ahead in BiS, but it does have a decent gap to cover, especially when you consider I'm already using a 277 weapon, and the weapon was the largest factor in whether or not one took Reaping.<br>
<br>
At any rate, the exact build would be <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100301153518/http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?deathknight#flc-n68QFeGyqM,qpF,11599" target="_blank">0/17/54</a>. The glyphs are intentional: GoBS pulls ahead of GoDD by about 5 dps.<br>
<br>
Still testing other possibilities and how things change at different gear levels, but I'm relatively confident about the above.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

The value of Subversion goes down from not taking Reaping (1 SS benefits more from 9% crit than 2 BS does), so GoBS just balances things out. Besides, what would you drop for Reaping? Necrosis? Its value jumps from Icy Talons. Morbidity? Already not taken. Icy Talons? That's half the reason the spec changes. There's nothing bad to drop for it.<br>
<br>
Yes, Icy Talons does affect pets.<br>
<br>
Edit: No, UB doesn't cut it either. No, we don't take GoDD, but we do get BI. At any rate, it's still a clear winner over Subversion. UB is such a maligned talent!<br>
<br>
Threat is a matter of opinion, of course. Even at, say, 10k dps, you're still only doing about 7k tps sans Subversion. It shouldn't be difficult for a tank to hold above that.<br>
<br>
In an AoE spec, it might be worth it, due to the nature of DnD, but that's anotehr matter entirely.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1572685"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Interesting results there Consider.   Bryntroll, the Bone Arbiter is an unusual weapon.  The proc + slightly faster speed probably skews things in the favour of the frost sub-spec.  BiS sets typically have more ArPen as well, which would also favour switching to the blood sub-spec.<br>
<br>
Even without Bryntoll, with low ArPen (under 600) I too get reaping-less Frost builds doing better than the reaping builds. I suspect they're going to do better than the blood builds too.<br>
<br>
At higher ArPen or with extra RP the reaping builds will do better, but blood sub-spec does better still, although it depends a bit on how much extra RP you get, and how you get it.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

GoDD will increase in value when factoring in AMS/revitalize, not to mention the fact that GoBS can be unreliable depending on the raid composition. GoBS is simply superior on paper; nothing more.

I simply used GoBS and specified it as someone would have inevitably asked about it.<br>

Despite using my gear, I did turn off Bryntroll's proc, to be safe. Like you said, although Frost sub-spec does favor Bryntroll, the results still stand without it.

<br>
The reason Infected Wounds and Frostfire Bolt work as a snare is because the debuff they apply has an additional effect to the snare. Infected Wounds slows attack speed, and FFB applies a dot. Bosses are not immune to the entire debuff because of those additional effects, and that's the only reason they work for GoBS. Most bosses are simply immune to all other snares and you wouldn't get the benefit of the glyph.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I know we're mostly discussing the upcoming patch, but I've been running optimization sims to play with current things, Kahories is telling me that 2 points in Morbidity is a 5 DPS increase over the standard 2 points in Dark Conviction which has been considered the 'superior' single target talent correct?</div>

</div>On single-targets, it's pretty close either way (with Morbidity possibly pulling ahead in situations where you have extra RP to dump due to revitalize/AMS and you're out of melee range).  For many people, I'd think the shorter cooldown on DnD makes it a winner.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I'm not sure on this but I think you misunderstood his point. Its not good because of getting motes of anger off seals/poisons; its good because when it procs you get the 50% attack PLUS a seal/poison and pally seals can crit for like 8k.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Does it mean Heroic Deathbringer's Will will no longer be BiS trinket for us? Replaced with say, Heroic 10m Trinket for Deathwhisper (crit one) I cant remamber name atm? I'm a bit confised here, and I'm nut quite sure about own match, however it seems right assuming we will do less Scourge Strikes (altough bit more benefiting for ArP now) and haste will go up in value once again due to frost subspec. So the question is: can some1 confirm or deny Heroic Deathbringer's Will still being BiS after (if) announced frost changes go life?

		<div id="post_message_1574275"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I don't see ArP losing value, so much as I see other stats gaining ground on it.  Haste's value would go up a bit with black ice benefitting Necrosis more than BA did, crit will probably remain about the same. Because the Bryntroll proc benefits from black ice and you'll be getting 20% more PPM with it due to talons, having that weapon would change your individual stat values much more significantly in 3.3.3 compared to now, so the value of haste vs ArP for you would probably have to be individually simmed.<br>
<br>
Bottom line seems to be, if you're getting/going for Shadowmourne, nothing changes, gear as always. If you're not getting Shadowmourne, H Bryntroll is likely going to be #2 in slot again before heroic LK loot (which can't be counted on seeing as nobody's killed him yet) and haste becomes slightly more attractive on gear but not enough so to gem for it or drop your ArP gear for haste gear.<br>
<br>
The big question for me will be where 4T9 258 becomes better than wearing T10 264, due to black ice being specced. T10 277 likely still outscales T9 258, but the gap will be narrowed significantly and I'd be using 4T9 on more than just heroic gunship and faction champs, probably subbing it in for deathwhisper, princes, sindragosa and putricide where strike damage is a lower proportion of your output, as well as LK.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1574315"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->I'll make an educated guess and say 4T9 increases in values by 10%. 2T10 will decrease by 25%, since we lose 25% of our SS. On single target 2+4T10 is still better than 2+4T9. On Deathwhisper, Lich King, Sindragosa and Dreamwalker 4T9 might pull ahead in personal DPS-terms, but I'm not sure if  the boss dies faster on Sindragosa, Lich King and Deathwhisper due to it. 4T10 will have a strong single target advantage and on those encounters the things you kill with AoE would die anyways, but you lose single target damage, which is the important bit on these encounters. On Dreamwalker you usually don't get to really AoE, as well, so I doubt the overall point of using 4T9 over 4T10 in general.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

As you can see, str jumps up, which is to be expected with increased Ghoul damage (via Icy Talons) and, of course, Endless Winter. Arp jumps down, which is to be expected without Reaping. Weapon Speed is primarily due to the loss of Reaping and generally higher reliance on non-strike damage. Crit doesn't change much, nor should it. <br>
<br>
The other changes, I can't quite make sense of. Hit/expertise shouldn't drop in value - they should rise, if anything, as not only are we auto-attacking more (and unlike yellow attacks, a missed white attack is a direct unrecoverable dps loss), but we're also more gcd locked (no reaping). Haste falling seems odd; although haste isn't quite like ArP, neither is it like crit - the fact that we have more of it shouldn't decrease it's value, even if it doesn't increase.  <br>
<br>
All in all, not very significant differences. BiS lists may not even change, although I haven't looked too deeply into it yet. Bryntroll does jump up in value, yes, partially due to weapon speed being less important and partially due to a higher proc rate. The hit/exp/haste oddities I'm still questioning, but those three stats are always troublesome for weights, anyways, so I'm not terribly troubled.<br>
<br>
Edit: As far as set bonuses are concerned, it's what's expected. You won't want to drop 4p t9 until 4p t10, but 4p t10 will still be worth it (even if you're going from 258 t9 to 264 t10). In AoE, it's still somewhat debatable, although I would bet 4p t10 still reigns supreme.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Arp is losing a little value due to frost subspec dealing more damage that doesn't scale with it, namely diseases and ghoul. Haste can't possibly be worse for frost subspec than blood though, I have no idea what's happening there. Apart from the hit and expertise oddities the rest of it looks about right.<br>
<br>
I'm interested in the weapon choice implications of this more than anything else though, does anyone know exactly what is and is not capable of proccing bryntroll since the nerfs?</div>

</div>First of all, long time reader and first time poster. I'd be lost without you guys. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20100303145500im_/http://elitistjerks.com/images/smilies/biggrin.gif" border="0" alt="" title=":D" class="inlineimg"><br>
<br>
I'm a bit confused here as well. With Frost sub spec, we're gaining more haste and losing Reaping. This means we'd be using Blood Strike more often which gains from ArP. The haste buff will also increase our damage from Necrosis and BCB which again both gain from ArP. I'm not sure why it's value would drop at all. I wouldn't expect it to go up much, but some at least.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1574475"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Damage goes up but the amount of it which does not benefit from armour penetration increases relative to total damage. This is due to black ice increasing spell damage and icy talons increasing ghoul damage, neither of which benefit from armour penetration. Therefore armour penetration becomes less powerful when compared to other stats.<br>
<br>
As for blood strike, that doesn't scale any better with armour penetration than scourge strike does.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

If you have ICY TALONS (the 5 point talent right after improved icy touch) , YOU will get that haste no matter what. That's how it works. Imp Icy Talons is still Windfury. Windfury and Improved Icy Talons do not stack.<br>

Example, you have Icy talons: you cast icy touch, you gain 20% haste.<br>
<br>
You have icy talons and improved icy talons: You cast icy touch, you gain 20% haste. Then THE RAID (this includes you) gains 20% haste from improved icy talons. You have 40% haste (45 with the 5% you get from getting imp icy talons), the Everyone else gets 20%.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Here's how it works. You pick up the talent Icy Talons and you now have your own personal 20% haste buff.

</div>This is, at least on live, false.  The assumption of many DKs is that "windfury and icy talons are melee haste buffs and the gargoyle casts."  True the gargoyle isnt effected by them.. but the gargoyle takes a snapshot of YOUR haste upon casting and does not distinguish between melee only and spell only.  <br>
<br>
I've now done multiple tests on live with a shaman grouped for windfury/bloodlust, massive amounts of haste gear and speced 0/17/54 to try different things out.  First test was with Icy Talons.. my ghouls gets the 20% haste buff as well as my gargoyle.. taking his strikes from 1.9 to 1.6 s cast time as predicted by haste formulas with 84 haste rating on my normal raid gear.  Windfury as well effects both ghoul and gargoyle, and with just windfury at 16% haste with my 84 haste rating nets a 1.7s cast time of gargoyle.  <br>
<br>
Now from what I'm seeing on sims gargoyle is overinflated.  At 84 haste rating I'm seeing around 32500 gargoyle hits for a 100h sim.  Assuming the sim isnt counting windfury for gargoyle it should average a 1.8s cast (bloodlust + ret pally aura drop it from 1.9).  Assuming this 1.8s cast is the average then it will need to do this for a full 30 sec every summon to get that many strikes.  <br>
<br>
There is something else that is wrong.  Yes, the gargoyle persists for 30 sec.. it does NOT attack for 30 sec.  With enough haste (bloodlust, haste rating, icy talons, speed pot, haste trink) I pushed the gargoyle strike cast time to 0.8s and the gargoyle was GCD locked at 1 s.  Every time I did this test I only got 19 strikes.  Every time.  This is simple math here.. 19 * 1 + 1 for first cast and you get 20 secs of gargoyle dps each cast time (which also means for a 100h sim you get 2000 summons of gargoyle netting a possible 38000 gargoyle strikes at maximum).  It would be of note that at this 0.8s cast time if I did not "twist" away, I would get 19 strikes + 1 melee netting in an actual dps increase from not twisting.  However, 10% of the time the gargoyle would fly around like an idiot and I'd only get 17 casts by not twisting.  So there is evidence both for and against "gargoyle twisting."  I myself am partial to the insurance for a non-stupid gargoyle.<br>
<br>
And yes, I know I could be wrong about the sim and wrong about the gargoyle on ptr (I'm not on ptr, my apologies for not testing there as well).. but I checked the no. of gargoyle hits with the buff "melee haste" checked and unchecked and they are virtually identical (+/- 100).  Now, if this is the case and the gargoyle is: a) not taking haste that it should and b) counting for too many hits; then you can assume that since the sim is fairly accurate there is dps being lost in something else but I'm not quite sure what yet.  That being said, if we fix the gargoyle on the sim and figure out where dps is being lost, we might be able to sim the changes in 3.3.3 better and have a more accurate picture of how our class/playstyle will need to change to net the highest dps.<br>
<br>
Feel free to test this info yourself and tell me I'm stupid.  I just don't want the unholy community moving forward on seemingly trivial false assumptions.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I did a few sims with DW unholy and it's competitive at least.   There's a couple of nasty bugs however, which are easy fixes but I've only just reported them.<br>
<br>
Firstly, OH Fallen crusader is bugged and procs off main-hand instead of off-hand attacks.  This means that dual-FC doesn't actually do anything, but if you're just using OH FC and a different MH enchant then you're going to be getting some extra procs which will boost your DPS.<br>
<br>
Secondly, OH BCB procs are doing MH attacks and so not using the MH damage multiplier.   If you have same speed weapons this means that your OH attacks are hitting for about 30-50% more than they should be (about 100-150 dps).  If you're using a really fast OH then you get more procs and so the dps is even more out of whack.<br>
<br>
I didn't finish testing it.  (have been busy doing other things over the weekend).  However once I fixed the bugs, I was getting sims that were within 50 dps of the the other builds around my gear level.   Some form of 0/18/53 is actually better than the straight 0/17/54.  Nerves of cold steel is more dps than the unholy talents and maybe more than icy talons.   (I was testing a 0/20/51 which isn't actually possible).<br>
<br>
The frost sub spec builds tended to scale better in general (blood scaled better with ar pen), and the DW was better than the 2H.  This seems to explain some of the results people are seeing.   Anyway, I'll do some more testing to confirm things when I get a chance.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I am not getting the same results in my current gear setup. When I put in the Stats using Kahorie's Sim it has:<br>
Unholy Reaping + Sub Blood  -14071 DPS <br>
Unholy Reapingless + Sub Frost - 13876 DPS<br>
This is giving me a 195dps difference between the two. This could be because of the EP value armor pen has with the Unholy Reaping + Blood Spec. The Sim I used had 808 armor pen. I am going to try it with Best in Slot list and see the results I get.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1575303"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->If you're getting any Unholy spec to do 14k dps in the sim, you're doing something incorrectly. What, exactly, is impossible to say without more information, but there's definitely <i>something</i>... especially if that isn't even a BiS list. The spec simply isn't capable of that much dps with the gear currently available. <br>
<br>
The simulator is a great tool, but it's only as smart as the person who's trying to use it. Very easy to get incorrect results and come to incorrect conclusions, which is why I brush off most of the random posts claiming "but I got X being higher than Y!" or what-have-you. When in doubt, post the actual sim results, not just the final dps number.<br>
<br>
Also, the difference in stat weights is incredibly minor, particularly for armor pen. ArP came in at 2% less in value for Frost Reapingless than Blood Reaping. 2% is essentially nothing, and the scaling of the two specs are actually near identical - the primary difference between how the specs rate appear to be Bryntroll/Shadowmourne verse Cryptmaker/Shadow's Edge.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Detoxx, check the attack power field and make sure you haven't input your total attack power, rather than the "green number" you see when you mouse-over your AP either on your character window or when viewing the armory. Should say something like "5100 + 467", and you would input the 467. That might be what is inflating your results.</div>

</div>Thank You, That is exactly what it was. I thought to myself those numbers were way too high.

				<div style="font-style:italic">If you're getting any Unholy spec to do 14k dps in the sim, you're doing something incorrectly. What, exactly, is impossible to say without more information, but there's definitely <i>something</i>... especially if that isn't even a BiS list. The spec simply isn't capable of that much dps with the gear currently available. <br>
<br>
The simulator is a great tool, but it's only as smart as the person who's trying to use it. Very easy to get incorrect results and come to incorrect conclusions, which is why I brush off most of the random posts claiming "but I got X being higher than Y!" or what-have-you. When in doubt, post the actual sim results, not just the final dps number.<br>
<br>
Also, the difference in stat weights is incredibly minor, particularly for armor pen. ArP came in at 2% less in value for Frost Reapingless than Blood Reaping. 2% is essentially nothing, and the scaling of the two specs are actually near identical - the primary difference between how the specs rate appear to be Bryntroll/Shadowmourne verse Cryptmaker/Shadow's Edge.</div>

This is only a 5 DPS difference? That can't be right. The difference shouldn't be so small. I posted the actual Sim results. The Glyphs for Unholy Sub Frost are Blood Strike, Ghoul, Icy Touch<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

The first is Blood 3.3.3, the second is Frost:<br>

Edit: Uh, you're not using Glyph of Icy Touch in the Frost sim. There would be your issue. You also don't seem to be using GoBS (which I didn't), so I have no clue what you're doing in its place.<br>
<br>
Edit 2: To the above, I'm getting similar results (about a 10 dps gap in favor of Frost). It seems the difference between the specs is not related to the quality of your gear - i.e, they both scale near equally. The primary difference between the specs is your weapon: if you have Bryntroll (heroic or normal) or Shadowmourne, then Frost will be somewhat substantially ahead (to the order of 50-100 dps). If you have a "normal" weapon, the gap appears to be like 5-15 dps, give or take. <br>
<br>
In almost any case, Frost does seem to pull ahead - the margin may be small, but its a margin in Frost's favor nonetheless. Not to mention the fact that Frost gives you more AoE damage, free interrupts (which can't hurt), and superior dps when moving (due to increased ghoul damage, and stronger IT/DND/DC). The only thing Blood will have going for it is the threat reduction, which is quite unnecessary in my opinion.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1575369"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->FWIW I did some analysis on the various scaling factors, looking at the DPS increase with each stat rather than the ratio vs AP (which is what the EP value is).  The numbers still come from the EP calculations.<br>
<br>
<table class="stg_table tborder"><tbody><tr class="alt2"><td>stat</td><td>DW</td><td>Frost</td><td>Blood</td></tr><tr class="alt1"><td>AP</td><td>0.76</td><td>0.71</td><td>0.7</td></tr><tr class="alt2"><td>Str</td><td>2.32</td><td>2.22</td><td>2.08</td></tr><tr class="alt1"><td>Crit</td><td>1.28</td><td>1.3</td><td>1.34</td></tr><tr class="alt2"><td>Haste</td><td>1.30</td><td>1.1</td><td>1.14</td></tr><tr class="alt1"><td>ArPen</td><td>1.42</td><td>1.6</td><td>1.66</td></tr></tbody></table><!-- table generated by StG's vB Code [table] v.0.1.6.0 (stable) o.95 --><br>
The main stat that changes as we upgrade gear is strength, we always want more of it.  The frost based build clearly scale better with strength than the blood build.<br>
The second best stat is ArPen, however it can be quite hard to find on the ilvl 277 gear.<br>
The haste stats should be taken with a bit of a grain of salt, as quantifying it's value is rather RNG dependent.  Usually we would avoid this stat, but for the DW build it might be more useful to gem for that crit.<br>
<br>
I also looked at the Weapon DPS scaling, although because I was considering a DW build, I just looked at the heroic vs non-heroic increase (+13 Ilvls).  Blood was only very slightly better than Frost at a 166 dps.  However the DW build did suffer a little bit (only 123 dps).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1575497"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->There seem to be a few inconsistencies with how people are using Kahorie's simulator in this thread. To compare data the same options must be used, or otherwise accounted for. The original post of this thread asserts that the default rotation of the Unholy-Reaping spec should change Horn of Winter to retry, is this still accurate? (<i>&lt;Horn retry="0" /&gt;</i> changed to <i>&lt;Horn retry="1" /&gt;</i>) I have played around with using Horn on retry or not, and it seems to have a bug that I can reproduce involving using bonus RP/time with horn set to retry. This bug will cause the simulator to show more (~70 with my statistics) DPS with HoW set to not retry, and also at times causes the simulator to break entirely (it will not attempt to use skills most of the time in the rotation) when HoW is set to retry. I am not sure what the cause of this is, but it may account for some errant simulations.<br>
<br>
Additionally, remember that all used buffs and options such as bonus RP/time, when to use bone shield, waiting for FC to proc to use GG, latency, diseases kept on target, and so on must be the identical or accounted for if you wish to compare your simulation data with others.<br>
<br>
Using my armory statistics with the following options (please correct me if any of these options are inaccurate, I suspect some may be) -<br>
Kahorie's v1.2.0.10, Glyphed Ghoul/DD/IT, all buffs sans Draenei aura, 40 rp/45 sec, use bone shield instead of blood strike, keep blood runes synched, use pets, wait for FC proc for GG, patch 3.3.3, 150ms latency, keep diseases on target, no intro, and simulator default rotations for both specs(reaping for 14/0/57 and reapingless for 0/17/54) :<br>

I conclude that I am hesitantly certain that Kahorie's simulator shows 0/17/54 as being a dps increase over 14/0/57, which is quite significant with Bryntroll but still there with other weapons.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1575752"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->If you carried out that sim run correctly and there's no bugs or modelling flaws in the 3.3.3 sim build, this result has some pretty worrying consequences for Unholy and indeed 2H DKs across the board.<br>
<br>
I doubt Blizzard will let it stand as Frost DW being the dominant spec; it was intended as a viable alternative to 2H with comparible DPS, not the superior option by such a large margin as 500 DPS, even trumping a Legendary 2H weapon.<br>
<br>
I'd hazard a guess that either Blizzard will tone down the Frost buffs in 3.3.3 before it goes live to bring it back in line with Unholy as people start getting more 277 gear, or the predicted outscaling of Unholy by Blood will manifest itself and bring with it the end the heyday of Unholy as the overall superior spec, leaving Blood as the most viable single target 2H spec with similar DPS to DW Frost.<br>
<br>
In the latter case, if even a BiS Blood spec with Shadowmourne sims as also inferior to Frost, something will be done about it.<br>
<br>
Perhaps we'll see Unholy recede back into being an AoE, utility and pet focused spec.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I'm chewing the numbers, but something feels amiss with the strike damage; DW Frost is getting on average 15k from OB and 6k with Blood Strike, while UH with the legendary Axe just 13k SS and 4.5k Blood Strike. There's a 600 dmg difference on average between BS's Shadowmourne damage and the mainhand portion in the Frost specc, which is fundamentally the topdmg difference between the two BiS weapons; it feels like a too small difference once you factor in the Arp and mainly the procc effect Shadowmourne brings.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1576082"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->It's very tricky to sim frost. The dps you saw is what can be achieved assuming perfect usage of KM and Rime procs. As in, it is almost unattainable by a human player. For example, frost and unholy sim similar numbers in my gear BEFORE patch 3.3.3, even though WMO, WOL, etc. clearly show unholy being the superior spec. I'm surprised that the gap between unholy and frost isn't simming to be even larger with patch 3.3.3 included to be honest. <br>
<br>
Unholy is by no means, in trouble. It still provides some of the most useful debuffs in the game, and excellent raid utility. Every raid will still require at least one UH DK. After the patch, all 3 DK specs are looking to be extremely competitive with each other in dps (how DKs compare with other classes is irrelevant). Thus, people should look to start dpsing in the spec that brings the most to the raid and is the most enjoyable, since one is no longer gimping himself by not speccing unholy.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Mine were BiS readings, mid-way I get the exact same. I posted mid-range values earlier though it appears they disappeared.  Just seems to scale significantly better with the big haste difference.<br>

</div>I don't know if I'd call it 'doomsaying'.  If you run various sims through BiS sets in various specs, numbers start coming out fairly similar across all specs.  I'd say that's pretty hopeful that they're finally nailing the inter-spec balance, which is a graet thing.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

The difference in DPS is very large in my opinion, and I'm wondering if things went wrong somewhere along the way, or if the results are accurate. One thing which makes me doubt the accuracy of the results is the uptime of my diseases on the Reaping simulation.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>It's been covered before, but the major difference is playstyle and comfort level with having to redo attacks. <b>Theortically</b> Str and ArP in particular will always give you better results, but there is a point where if you don't have enough Expertise you can start to chain dodges, which will lead to rune pushback and thus much more harmful to your DPS than dropping a few Str/ArP for enough expertise to keep you efficient.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Correct.  That's really the only oddity I came across.  To be fair, my DW setup for the sim was also using Heroic LK weapons.  Considering nobody at all has downed heroic LK yet, it will still be some time before many people get their hands on those as well.  Everything I've seen/done so far shows all the specs within 2-3% of each other from a Sim standpoint, which is only a very rough gauge.  Again, it looks more promising/hopeful than negative.  Having each spec be a viable option is something everybody should strive for.  Unholy is definitely not in any danger, it's a benefit to  us as well.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I did some searching and couldn't find any data on Luck of the Draw, which I assume would work the same as the raid buff. This is unsuprising, being that LotD is a 5 man buff and EJ deals with raid encounters. However, double dipping on Blood Presence (a % damage increase buff) would imply that it would, and this would give Unholy some extra scaling as well as tweaking our sims/stat weights.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

<br>
Basically I am a long time DK player and have done enough ICC encounters enough to start questioning the need for Dirge in our spec. <br>
<br>
With Frost now being a viable subspec, and everyone talking about going UH-Sub Frost in a Reapingless build, wouldn't it also be possible to go UH-Sub Frost in a Reaping build if we drop Dirge and 1 point in Dark Conviction?<br>
<br>
I do not expect simulators to show this being the case simply b/c sims don't use AMS to soak RP like all any good DKs does. If anything this idea would have to be tested out in raid situations. There simply are so many ICC encounters you can use AMS on CD, Sindragosa's constant AoE and Unchained Magic, LDW's constant AOE and her Blood Whirl, Putricide's Volatile Ozzes or running through green slime etc. <br>
<br>
The reasons for doing it:<br>
<br>
I've noticed that more often than not I simply have too much RP. And 2 BS do not do as much damage as 1 SS, in current ICC gear. Also with SS benefiting from Black Ice and going into Runic Power Mastery will allow you to soak even more RP, it would be hard to imagine Dirge being necessary for many of our builds. It only adds 20RP after our first rotation in reapingless builds. Then again not having Butcery might also kill our rp generation.<br>
<br>
The main reason for this in my opinion would be simply b/c I never feel RP starved and quite the opposite, I feel I have too much during many encounters. <br>

i don't think you get what i'm saying, if you take off all rp generation and ignore what we're using it for i.e. DC, then a frost reaping subspec will definitely pull ahead of one with dirge b/c you're essentially ignoring your rp generation altogether, like i said in my post, you can't run this through sims b/c every fight is different and you'd be using ams at different times each fight, yes in a sim dirge is worth it, but sims are just models of actual gameplay<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Sims will always show Dirge being worth taking. If your raid comp is stacked with resto druids specced revitalize who are always assured to be keeping hots on you, it could be argued that the points aren't worth it any longer on a pure tank and spank boss, but this can't ever be counted on even if your raid has three trees in it.<br>
<br>
I am going to be going the H bryntroll / enough haste to squeeze another GCD option in 3.3.3 due to the number of fights where you are going to be using a spell GCD instead of a strike one more frequently - there are just too many fights where you are out of melee range of your target, or have to target switch to a target that is not in melee range, to not want a talent that awards you extra RP, especially compared to alternatives.<br>
<br>
With death coil frequently critting for well over 10K for me right now, its value for me is significant enough for use of a GCD to not want to waste RP. Having RPM in 3.3 + revitalize / AMS (there are more uses for this on heroic than on normal) will mean more situations where you have 120 and need the extra GCD in your rotation to dump it all. And the relative value of ArP diminishes without the 100ish provided by H cryptmaker or SE. So if anything, I myself will be aiming for -more- haste to squeeze another GCD in and thus Dirge is a very valuable talent.<br>
<br>
ed: As for all the "is bryntroll bis now" debate, for the love of god, <b>sim it yourself to find out if it's bis for you</b>. If you're not getting shadowmourne and you're an orc, it probably is regardless. Your other viable options in descending order are 25-man heroic LK weapons (not likely many people if any are going to be brandishing any of those for a while yet), heroic cryptmaker, heroic warmace of menethil (LK 10 heroic), heroic bloodfall (not very well itemized for us), 25-man LK normal weapons, or PVP weapons.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

If as an Unholy DK you obtain Shadowmourne, when the souls are fully charged (+Max Strength) would Glyph of Disease be a DPS benefit?<br>
<br>
Simply because applying the diseases at +540 Str. and keeping them rolling with only missing out on 1 BS + GoIT.<br>
<br>
(Basically spamming SS and DC with BS and Pest) <br>
<br>
Or am I missing the point that GoD refreshes DoTs without carrying forward their original damage.  Not sure if this sort of trick would be built into the SIM. (Or if it would even be worth it)<br>
<br>
I have tried the math and I was having problems removing the IT damage bonus of GoIT.  It seemed to pull ahead because of the ramp time being eliminated from Shadowmourne.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">That's interesting as I just got a PM from a trust-worthy person arguing expertise was being shown too high at the moment. It's a difficult thing to sort out, but I'll look into it.<br>
<br>
Anyways, two Bryntroll notes: On top of the application of debuffs no longer having a chance to proc, Blood-Caked Blade no longer appears to as well. I'm not exactly sure how recent this change is or isn't, but I'm fairly positive it didn't coincide with the SS change, so it's more likely from the same time as the debuff change. Disheartening regardless. Secondly, the heroic version appears to have the same proc rate (2PPM, or ~11.333%) as the normal version, as expected.<br>
<br>
Testing:<br>

(Still hitting away at the dummy, but I figure this is a large enough sample size)<br>
<br>
77/666 = 11.561%<br>
<br>
Suffice is to say that, of the 277 weapons, Bryntroll heroic is the worst and of the 264 weapons, Bryntroll normal is the worst.</div>

</div>Sorry, I should have specified a bit more. To be more clear, I'm wondering if having a frost sub-spec will make H Bryntroll scale on par or higher than H Cryptmaker due to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100304232411/http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=49664" target="_blank">Blackice</a> for increased proc damage and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100304232411/http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=50887" target="_blank">Icy Talons</a> for more opportunities to proc. Does testing show that there is a proc cap, regardless of # hits per min? <br>
<br>
All of this is in hopes to continue the discussion a few pages back from:<br>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Your total damage from Bry proc will be increased by around 25-28% when compairing Blood reaping to Frost non reaping. Thats 10% boost from talents, an additional proc chance from the extra Blood strike every 2nd rune cycle and 16% more normal white hits from 20% haste on top of current raid buffed haste.</div>

</div>Not quite. The fact that it only procs off of Auto-attacks, SS physical, BS, and PS remains true, yes. The fact that the proc chance is 2 ppm (11.33%) remains true, yes. But the line at the end of that post - that heroic Bryntroll is inferior to heroic Cryptmaker and normal Bryntroll is inferior to normal Shadow's Edge and normal Cryptmaker may or may not still hold - and preliminary math is showing it doesn't.<br>
<br>
Due to sub-speccing into Frost, Bryntroll gets a large boost. 20% more auto-attacks translates into about 5 more proc opportunities per minute. As well, since we (once again) won't be taking Reaping, that's an additional 3 proc opportunities per minute. Black Ice is pretty straight-forward in how it affects it: 10% more proc damage.<br>
<br>
All in all, the weapon gets a modest boost, and at current gear levels, Bryntroll will pull ahead. In BiS, heroic Cryptmaker would win, but that's rather irrelevant due to the fact that for BiS heroic Glorenzelg (and, obviously, Shadowmourne) is going to beat both handily (due to raw ilvl and weapon dps, everything else aside). <br>
<br>
When I have the time, I'll throw up the 3.3.3 BiS lists/stat weights/etc, but it's not a huge priority as little enough changes.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Now that simcraft knows this trick, I end up seeing 0/17/54 being a dps loss of around 20 or so compared to the traditional 14/0/57 since, without Reaping, you can't pull the tap trick.  Perhaps Kahorie's doesn't use this yet but it definitely calls into question if 0/17/54 truly is an increase.  Combine with even fewer free GCDs  (thanks to losing Reaping) and I think you ultimately end up with 0/17/54 not really being an improvement, perhaps short of Bryntroll or <b>maybe</b> Shadowmourne.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1578654"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->The blood tap trick is a good trick, but isn't really as effective as you seem to suggest.<br>
Taking out all the other strikes etc, assuming you go BS BT (small pause for the UI) SS (with 2xD) and then want to do it again when the next blood tap is up, you'll find that you have 2 death runes when you want to use the trick again.  So you have to wait for an additional 10 seconds.   So you gain half a SS every 70ish seconds.  Using the Blood Tap for a straight BS you gain one BS every 60 ish seconds.   Once you factor in the time difference it really is only a small buff to reaping.  <br>
<br>
That said depending on your gear and latency etc sub frost reaping is a possible build.<br>
<br>
On another note people should really stop obsessing over small dps boosts.  None of the simulators we run are that accurate.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>For the time being I will assume that pets not getting the buff is an oversight on blizz's part that they will fix in a subsequent patch or hotfix.<br>
<br>
Even if it doesn't get fixed, it would mean blood would have a very slight advantage over unholy towards the end of the content cycle, maybe a couple hundred DPS difference - by the time the amount of DPS matters, it is unlikely we will still be considering icecrown to be progression.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">Been skimming over the most recent posts, and I am sure someone said it and got shot down by now. I am just curious how viable a DW unholy spec will be with the changes to Icy Talons in 3.3.3.</div>

</div>Rather viable.  Some sort of 2H build is of course best in the BiS gear purely because Shadowmourne is by far the best weapon you can get.  However,  if you don't / won't get Shadowmourne then the 3 main 2H and DW builds all sim around each  other depending on what other conditions you have in your sim.<br>
<br>
The best single target DW build is basically the no-reaping build.  However (for single target at least) you move 3 points from Black Ice to Nerves of Cold Steel (which is almost twice as valuable).  If you need to get morbidity for better AE damage you can take them outbreak, rather than necrosis.<br>
<br>
As you can use Blood Boil rather than most Blood Strikes, the build has more GCDs and is less dependent on expertise.  It's probably the build with the best haste scaling and has slightly better strength scaling than other builds.<br>
<br>
The build is less weapon dependent than others.  You'll want a good slow MH but OH weapon speed doesn't really matter, and it is only used for autoattack related damage.  Using a fast mainhand isn't recommended, as it's equivalent to a tier and half lower main hand.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>I just started playing with the sim for the first time today and really have zero clue as to what to do really with it at times, but I am trying to figure it out now. I understand what ya mean by moving talents from and to where, but what about a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100307145127/http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?deathknight#flP1UWR9fpCGD,HpF,11599" target="_blank">0/18/53</a> spec?<br>

		<div id="post_message_1579452"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->If you have an idea of a spec you want to sim with, but are considering moving around a couple of points, the StatTalentDPSValue button is useful as it'll tell you how much that final point of each talent is worth.  Of course the value will depend on what rotation/priority you use and what gear etc.  Trying to find the optimal DPS strategy for a DK is a little bit of an art.<br>

Anyhow the last time I ran it for the DW build I got a display that came out like this.   (I was running 2 BI, 5 Necrosis 0 Morbidity and 3 Outbreak)<br>

</div>Morbidity doesn't appear in the list because it wasn't in the build.  Sometimes you have to put in speculative talents (for instance if you were thinking about dipping into subversion (not usually worth it for a sub frost build)).  However morbidity is a special case as it's pretty much equivalent to 1/2 the unholy blight value for single target, so I don't usually put it in. (In this case morbidity is worth around 60 DPS, so not worth it for a straight single-target build)<br>
<br>
Now obviously you can't necessarily remove all the weak talents.  <br>
<br>
I originally did have 3 points in Black Ice, but as you can see it's value is less than that of Necrosis (or of Outbreak which is where I moved it to as I already had full Necrosis),  (Necrosis is quite a bit stronger for DW than 2H).  <br>
<br>
If we want Morbidity we have a few options.  Taking points from Epidemic conceivably makes sense in a single target environment however we usually want Morbidity for better AE in which case we want longer diseases, so we'll skip that.<br>
We can't take anymore points from the frost tree (all the talents are either valuable deep talents or required in order to get said deep talents).  So it has to come from the Unholy tree.  The only real options are desolation (which is useful for AE) and Outbreak (which would get weaker with AE).<br>
<br>
Some talents are pretty sensitive to the conditions of your simulation because they'll chance the sequence of actions.  Dirge is one example as it provides extra RP and the amount of RP you can use depends on how many free GCDs and may affect the sequence of events. Reaping is a more severe case.  So you have to be a bit careful evaluating them.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic"><b>Reaping versus Reapingless</b>, <br>
<br>
<b><u>Dirge</u></b>, is it worth it?<br>
<br>
Basically I am a long time DK player and have done enough ICC encounters enough to start questioning the need for Dirge in our spec. <br>
<br>
With Frost now being a viable subspec, and everyone talking about going UH-Sub Frost in a Reapingless build, wouldn't it also be possible to go UH-Sub Frost in a Reaping build if we drop Dirge and 1 point in Dark Conviction?<br>
<br>
I do not expect simulators to show this being the case simply b/c sims don't use AMS to soak RP like all any good DKs does. If anything this idea would have to be tested out in raid situations. There simply are so many ICC encounters you can use AMS on CD, Sindragosa's constant AoE and Unchained Magic, LDW's constant AOE and her Blood Whirl, Putricide's Volatile Ozzes or running through green slime etc. <br>
<br>
The reasons for doing it:<br>
<br>
I've noticed that more often than not I simply have too much RP. And 2 BS do not do as much damage as 1 SS, in current ICC gear. Also with SS benefiting from Black Ice and going into Runic Power Mastery will allow you to soak even more RP, it would be hard to imagine Dirge being necessary for many of our builds. It only adds 20RP after our first rotation in reapingless builds. Then again not having Butcery might also kill our rp generation. <br>
<br>
The main reason for this in my opinion would be simply b/c I never feel RP starved and quite the opposite, I feel I have too much during many encounters. <br>
<br>
Ideas, thoughts, suggestions, go.</div>

	</tbody></table>
</div><br>
I feel the same, I don't plan on running dirge post 3.3.3.  I currently run 12/0/59 with only 1 point in dirge and may move it out; 3/3 Morbidity.  I always feel I have to much RP. but yes, I have a tree, fully utilize AMS/Blood Tap/and I'm a BE(Torrent). Especially when I get a 10-12k Deathcoil and don't feel like overwriting the UHB Dot.  I may run Frost Sub/Reaping with 4/5 Necrosis.  If anyone wants WoL data on my build from ICC25 let me know. I'll at least test this out live to see how the loss of butchery/dirge affect me.  I just don't feel comfortable simming RP talents and prefer to test them live. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100307145127/http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?deathknight#flc-n6k9pcywmS,HFp,11599" target="_blank">0/14/54 Frost/Reaping</a><!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

				<div style="font-style:italic">I feel the same, I don't plan on running dirge post 3.3.3.  I currently run 12/0/59 with only 1 point in dirge and may move it out; 3/3 Morbidity.

I may run Frost Sub/Reaping with 4/5 Necrosis.  If anyone wants WoL data on my build from ICC25 let me know. I'll at least test this out live to see how the loss of butchery/dirge affect me.  I just don't feel comfortable simming RP talents and prefer to test them live. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100307145127/http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?deathknight#flc-n6k9pcywmS,HFp,11599" target="_blank">0/14/54 Frost/Reaping</a></div>

	</tbody></table>
</div>The main reason for the increased Horn usage is because the build uses Blood Boil rather than Blood Strike when it can, and so has more spell GCDs.  (Although at about 1200 ArPen BS hits harder).  I just used the standard 150 latency, but the effect is more noticeable if you increase it.  (I play with 250-350 latency).   I didn't have horn in my priority and the auto horn is a little bit conservative.  I also had some extra RP and wasn't expertised capped, but that all doesn't really change things much.<br>
<br>
The gear was based around the profile at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100307145127/http://www.wowhead.com/?profile=20921647" target="_blank">Profiler - Wowhead</a>, although I swapped a few more gems for a bit more hit in the DW one.<br>
<br>
It was a pretty simple setup, the default Unholy priority for the 2H build and a BP &gt; FF &gt; Desolation (BS) &gt; SS &gt; BB &gt; DC for the DW one.  <br>
<br>
I could've gone for a more complex priority or rotation (I've been trying and struggling to implement a disease twisting priority) but I figured that was good enough for a rough test showing how close things actually are.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

Cinder glacier procing is only worthwhile if youre using GoD and you're not going to nerf fallen crusader up-time. There's several fights where CG fishing is very viable, a good example is sindragosa. You'd try to proc cinderglacier during the air phase on the ice tombs then roll the disease the rest of the ground phase.<br>
<br>
Most DK's don't get a tricks for rolling diseases at the start of every fight, where as synti and the other paragon DK's usually do.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1581463"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->Regarding dropping points from Ebon Plaguebringer and Cryptic Fever.  You need 1 point in CF for the 3rd disease.<br>
If you do have another Unholy DK then yeah you can drop the other 5 points, but that's obviously not always an option.  The other 2 points in Crypt Fever are generally better than the alternatives in all other cases (even if you're the only one that benefits).  If you have a moonkin and a single target fight then you don't need to spec EP, but skipping that is probably only gaining you 100dps for all 3 points.<br>
<br>
As for GoD.  Assuming you can get a tricks or even successfully fish for CG then it's worth it for all builds. Fishing for a CG proc might take some time though, with a slow 2H the effective PPM is still only just larger than 4.  Diseases with the very best multipliers (Razorice, Cinder-Glacier, Tricks) is more than a 600 dps boost even accounting for the lost DC damage).<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

</div>Even without high crit. The single target dps loss from switching from DC to Morbidity turned out to be around 50 dps. I value the increased utility over that 50 dps myself.<br>
<br>
I assume that if you have a high crit chance that that difference grows smaller.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

I agree with this, and will run my 12/0/59 and off set the next week with 0/17/54 and see how they compare for myself before making the perma switch to sub frost.  Though as a I posted earlier, I'll be testing my 0/17/54 build with reaping and posting the results here for some analzysis.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

It is only a 13 DPS Difference. After adding more Crit Rating to the Sims, the DPS Difference began to rise more in the favor of 14-00-57 Unholy but then began to fluctuate as the Crit became even higher. The DPS Difference between the two is very minor.<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>

		<div id="post_message_1582077"><!-- google_ad_section_start -->As it stands I believe Blood is currently better for absolute single target dps, but only slightly and its only really for fight suchs as DBS, Festergut, BQL.  So with this new ICC buff gaining 5% every 2 weeks (I think) Blood will once again rain supreme spec since the small gap of dps will only become larger when the % increases?<br>
<br>
Also, am I correct in assume to max out single target dps for Unholy we use GoD instead of GoDD &amp; Ninja Tricks off the Rogues for the pull?<!-- google_ad_section_end --></div>
